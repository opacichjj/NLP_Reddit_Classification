You come across a fascinating post and are just dying to discuss it but the thread is stale or archived. Or you are doing a reread and come across the perfect piece of evidence to that theory you posted months ago. Or you have a theory forming on the tip of your tongue and isn't quite there yet and would love to hash it out with fellow crows.

Now is your time.

**You now all have permission to give that old thread the kiss of life, shamelessly plug your own theory you are proud of, or share something that was overlooked or deserves another analysis.**

"Something thats always bothered me is Tywin's complete omission of Elia when issuing orders. Ordering the deaths of two innocent children is horrifying, but Tywin makes a decent stab in rationalising his actions (although they are beyond abhorrent and evil):

&gt;We had come late to Robert's cause. It was necessary to demonstrate our loyalty. When I laid those bodies before the throne, no man could doubt that we had forsaken House Targaryen forever.

Its hard to fault this reasoning from a practical standpoint. House Lannister had come late, the babes were a problem, and Robert would only cement himself as the evil Usurper had he bloodied his own hands. Of course, Robert should have publicly condemned the brutal killing rather than saying 'dragonspawn' whilst privately rewarding Tywin (i feel ill talking about this).

But Tywin even highlights himself:

&gt;I grant you, it was done too brutally. Elia need not have been harmed at all, that was sheer folly. By herself she was nothing.

Again this makes pragmatic sense. Elia by herself doesnt exactly have a strong claim to kingship and if anything she would prove a useful hostage as Dorne was not yet subdued. Yet he completely omits her when giving orders.

Thus far i see two possibilities, one is that he didnt actually expect Elia to be in the Nursery. This makes no sense as Elia was all but confirmed to be in Maegor's holdfast and Tywin served under Aerys for years, he would understand that Aerys in his paranoid nature would want to keep Elia close as a 'hostage' guaranteeing future Dornish loyalty.

The other is he 'trusted' Gregor not to do her harm. This is supported by:

&gt;Nor did I yet grasp what I had in Gregor Clegane, only that he was huge and terrible in battle.

I dont get this, Tywin handpicked two men to go murder children. How could he not understand what he had with them? Not just ordinary children, but two very valuable ones. Think about it, the Rebellion is not yet finished. The Reach and Dorne remain loyal to the Targaryens, as interrogation would soon tell them Viserys and Rhaella had fled to Dragonstone. Kings Landing is in chaos. The two children could be slipped out or replaced with others and sold to the loyalists without too much trouble. Rhaenys in particular as she has Dornish looks. So clearly he knew two things, that they were cruel and stupid. Stupid enough not to see the potential value in the children, and cruel enough to murder children with no questions asked. How can he rightly be 'surprised' when Gregor does something both stupid and cruel? Those are the two character traits you were counting on.

But why omit Elia completely? Even with the other 'pressing' concerns of Jaime's safety and Ned Stark's van, Elia remains an extremely valuable hostage. Sure she has no claim to the Iron Throne, but she is highly valuable to the Dornish and could very easily help secure Robert's throne as the Rebellion's victory is not yet a sure thing. All it takes is a cursory mention of 'take Elia hostage'. If proving loyalty to Robert was a concern, taking Elia as a hostage is hardly a detriment.

In some ways I'm inclined to believe Oberyn's reasoning. Tywin Lannister 'is not a man to forget such slights.' The Reynes, Tarbecks, Aerys, even Tyrion all learnt this. I think Tywin omitted Elia not out of forgetfulness, but out of spite. He didn't care what happened to her. The omission was intentional, he may even have given the orders for her to be killed.",asoiaf
"Apologies if this has been posted before.

In ADWD, at the House of Black and White, Arya is tasked to kill an old man in Braavos who swindles ship captains by selling them “insurance”. She notices that he bites each coin to make sure it’s real and kills him by coating a gold coin in poison and switching it out with one from one of his buyers.

&gt; “The golden dragon of Westeros,” said the kindly man. “And how did you come by this? We are no thieves.”

&gt; “It wasn’t stealing. I took one of his, but I left him one of ours.” 

&gt; The kindly man understood. “And with that coin and the others in his purse, he paid a certain man. Soon after that man’s heart gave out. Is that the way of it? Very sad.”
&gt; (The Ugly Little Girl, ADWD)

In the prologue of AFFC, Pate trades “the alchemist” (who is a Faceless Man) a Citadel master key for a golden dragon.

&gt; “Pate grabbed it from his hand. The gold felt warm against his palm. He brought it to his mouth and bit down on it the way he’d seen men do. If truth be told, he wasn’t sure what gold should taste like, but he did not want to look a fool.”

&gt; [Pate] was halfway down the alley when the cobblestones began to move beneath his feet. The stones are slick and wet, he thought, but that was not it. He could feel his heart hammering in his chest. “What’s happening?” he said. His legs had turned to water. “I don’t understand.”
&gt; (Prologue, AFFC)

The Faceless Man uses the same poison on Pate as Arya does on the salesman in ADWD.

This is such a small detail and has very little actual impact on the narrative (besides confirming the fact that it is a Faceless Man in Oldtown), but I’ve reread ASOIAF so many times and have never caught it until now. It blows my mind how intricate and detailed this worldbuilding is.

"One of the things I was sorry not to get more than a brief flashback of was the end of Robert's Rebellion: Jaime Lannister killing Aerys, and Ned Stark riding into the Great Hall to find him on the Iron Throne. 

There are two main POV descriptions of it, one from Ned Stark in AGOT and one from Jaime in ASOS and I find it fascinating to read them in light of each other (especially given these are recollections fourteen years later by two men who were 19 and 17 respectively at the time).

&amp;#x200B;

AGOT Eddard II

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""I cannot answer for the gods, Your Grace … only for what I found when I rode into the throne room that day,"" Ned said. ""Aerys was dead on the floor, **drowned in his own blood**. His dragon skulls stared down from the walls. **Lannister's men were everywhere. Jaime wore the white cloak of the Kingsguard over his golden armor. I can see him still. Even his sword was gilded. He was seated on the Iron Throne, high above his knights, wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lion's head. How he glittered**!""  
&gt;  
&gt;""This is well known,"" the king complained.  
&gt;  
&gt; ""I was still mounted. **I rode the length of the hall in silence, between the long rows of dragon skulls**. It felt as though they were watching me, somehow. I stopped in front of the throne, looking up at him. **His golden sword was across his legs, its edge red with a king's blood.** My men were filling the room behind me. Lannister's men drew back. **I never said a word. I looked at him seated there on the throne, and I waited. At last Jaime laughed and got up. He took off his helm, and he said to me, 'Have no fear, Stark. I was only keeping it warm for our friend Robert. It's not a very comfortable seat, I'm afraid.'""**  
&gt;  
&gt;The king threw back his head and roared. His laughter startled a flight of crows from the tall brown grass. They took to the air in a wild beating of wings. ""You think I should mistrust Lannister because he sat on my throne for a few moments?"" He shook with laughter again. ""Jaime was all of seventeen, Ned. Scarce more than a boy.""  
&gt;  
&gt; **""Boy or man, he had no right to that throne.""**   
&gt;  
&gt; ""Perhaps he was tired,"" Robert suggested. ""**Killing kings is weary work. Gods know, there's no place else to rest your ass in that damnable room.** And he spoke truly, it is a monstrous uncomfortable chair. In more ways than one."" The king shook his head. ""Well, now I know Jaime's dark sin, and the matter can be forgotten.""  

&amp;#x200B;

What I find interesting about this is that Ned remembers the dead king using a poetic, noble cliche of being drowned in his own blood. He clearly remembers Jaime wearing his golden, Lannister armour, including a helm in the shape of his house sigil, as well as his white Kingsguard cloak, and the detail of Jaime's sword being red with the king's blood tells us that Jaime's sword was *unsheathed* across his knees, the traditional posture of a lord preparing to refuse guest right to a visitor. Also, he's surrounded by Lannister forces, while Ned's men are still arriving behind him. 

From this perspective, Ned's silence is very much that of a man who knows the situation is on a knife's edge. Has Jaime taken the throne for himself? The bared blade is a sign he's prepared to refuse it. And Ned, unlike Robert who wasn't there, has carried this as Jaime's worst offence, the ultimate reason Robert shouldn't trust him. Robert absolutely doesn't take it seriously: Jaime was just a kid, maybe he wanted to sit down, who cares after all this time? But Ned, at the time, absolutely thought Jaime was seriously considering refusing the throne to Robert, and took his silence (until he broke the tension with a joke) as a threat.  

Then we come, several books later, to how Jaime remembers it:

ASOS Jaime II

 

&gt; Jaime had slipped in through the king's door, clad in his golden armor, sword in hand. ***The golden armor, not the white, but no one ever remembers that. Would that I had taken off that damned cloak as well.***  
&gt;  
&gt;When Aerys saw the blood on his blade, he demanded to know if it was Lord Tywin's. ""I want him dead, the traitor. I want his head, you'll bring me his head, or you'll burn with all the rest. All the traitors. Rossart says they are inside the walls! He's gone to make them a warm welcome. Whose blood? Whose?""  
&gt;  
&gt; ""Rossart's,"" answered Jaime.   
&gt;  
&gt; Those purple eyes grew huge then, and the royal mouth drooped open in shock. He lost control of his bowels, turned, and ran for the Iron Throne. **Beneath the empty eyes of the skulls on the walls, Jaime hauled the last dragonking bodily off the steps, squealing like a pig and smelling like a privy. A single slash across his throat was all it took to end it.** So easy, he remembered thinking. A king should die harder than this. Rossart at least had tried to make a fight of it, though if truth be told he fought like an alchemist. Queer that they never ask who killed Rossart . . . but of course, he was no one, lowborn, Hand for a fortnight, just another mad fancy of the Mad King.   
&gt;  
&gt; Ser Elys Westerling and Lord Crakehall and others of his father's knights burst into the hall in time to see the last of it, so **there was no way for Jaime to vanish and let some braggart steal the praise or blame.** It would be blame, he knew at once when he saw the way they looked at him . . . though perhaps that was fear. Lannister or no, he was one of Aerys's seven.   
&gt;  
&gt; ""The castle is ours, ser, and the city,"" Roland Crakehall told him, which was half true. Targaryen loyalists were still dying on the serpentine steps and in the armory, Gregor Clegane and Amory Lorch were scaling the walls of Maegor's Holdfast, and Ned Stark was leading his northmen through the King's Gate even then, but Crakehall could not have known that. He had not seemed surprised to find Aerys slain; Jaime had been Lord Tywin's son long before he had been named to the Kingsguard.   
&gt;  
&gt; ""Tell them the Mad King is dead,"" he commanded. ""**Spare all those who yield and hold them captive.""**   
&gt;  
&gt; ""Shall I proclaim a new king as well?"" Crakehall asked, and Jaime read the question plain: Shall it be your father, or Robert Baratheon, or do you mean to try to make a new dragonking? **He thought for a moment of the boy Viserys, fled to Dragonstone, and of Rhaegar's infant son Aegon**, still in Maegor's with his mother. *A new Targaryen king, and my father as Hand. How the wolves will howl, and the storm lord choke with rage.* For a moment he was tempted, until he glanced down again at the body on the floor, in its spreading pool of blood. **His blood is in both of them, he thought. ""Proclaim who you bloody well like**,"" he told Crakehall. Then he climbed the Iron Throne and seated himself with his sword across his knees, to see who would come to claim the kingdom. **As it happened, it had been Eddard Stark.** 

ASOS Jaime VI

&gt; He remembered Eddard Stark, riding the length of Aerys's throne room **wrapped in silence. Only his eyes had spoken; a lord's eyes, cold and grey and full of judgment.** 

&amp;#x200B;

So for Jaime, the detail that he'd worn his golden armour and not the white should, he thinks, go some way towards mitigating people's opinions of what he did. He even thinks that if he'd taken the Kingsguard cloak off, people wouldn't view him as being quite so bad. Ned judged Jaime on his *acts*, but Jaime thinks *appearances* are as key. 

When he reflects on killing Aerys, it's distinctly *not* romanticised. (They never tell you how they all shit themselves). I don't think the 'pig' in the sentence before Jaime cutting the Mad King's throat is an accident: he slaughtered his king with as much ceremony and honour as a farmer slaughtering a hog. Of course, at this point, we don't know as readers the full catalogue of the Mad King's atrocities, or that Jaime has spent two years being forced to witness them, but this is an early sign that to Jaime, by then, Aerys was no longer king or even really human. (You could argue that this was a mechanism for Jaime to depersonalise the man he was about to murder, but nothing in Jaime's POV chapters indicates he needs to do that in order to kill people).  For Ned, the Mad King was still king, dying drowning in blood. For Jaime, he's an animal to be put down. 

Then we have Jaime discovered with Aerys still bleeding out, and an indication that he'd least considered the possibility he might get away with it undiscovered. He doesn't seem to have a plan, other than that, so now he has to wing his way through brazening it out. He takes charge, giving orders that might end the fighting without two much more bloodshed; he considers fucking everything up for the sheer fun of it by claiming the Iron Throne for one of the last two Targareyans, but ""his blood is in both of them"" - another early indication that Aerys is much, much worse than we know, because Aegon is the son of a man Jaime likes and not the product of Targareyan incest, so quite possibly a safe bet. Finally, he washes his hands of the decision verbally at precisely the moment he *acts* to make it his decision unilaterally, by sitting on the throne with his sword across his knees. But being Jaime, he doesn't think about that *at all*, or even vaguely reflect on how that's going to look to anyone else. 

Finally, from a different chapter, we have Jaime's POV of Ned's silent ride. That recollection comes in the middle of a dream in which the dead ride silently - without even a hoofbeat or the clink of a bridle - and that it's what occurs to Jaime *immediately* gives more weight to the silence. There's no way Ned rode a horse over a stone floor in utter silence, but Jaime felt *Ned's* silence so heavily it was the only thing that mattered. And while Ned, in his recollection, seems to me to have been unsure of how things would play out (and very reasonably not wanting to have to fight Jaime Lannister and a bunch of Lannister men), Jaime *immediately* takes Ned's silence as judgement, just as he immediately sees 'blame' in the faces of the Lannister men who discover him killing the king. And he resents it: Ned's eyes aren't just 'grey and full of judgement' but '*cold* and grey'

As we know from Ned's POV, he responds after a moment by cracking a joke. 

And he's going to go on cracking jokes as a defence mechanism for the next fourteen years - as Tyrion tells us, ""There was very little that Jaime took seriously. Tyrion knew that about his brother, and forgave it.""

Ned, however, takes everything seriously, and holds onto that moment for the rest of his life. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR The differences in Ned's recollection of the Mad King's death and Jaime's illustrate their different priorities and also, Jaime's lack of awareness at the age of 17 as to how others might interpret his actions.",asoiaf
"Some excerpts from AWOIAF:

&gt;Casterly Rock, the ancient seat of House Lannister, is no ordinary castle. Although crowned with towers and turrets and watchtowers, with stone walls and oaken gates and iron portcullises guarding its every means of egress, this ancient fortress is in truth a colossal rock beside the Sunset Sea, a rock that some say looks like a lion in repose when the sun sets and the shadows fall.

&gt;The Rock has been measured as **thrice the height of the Wall or the Hightower of Oldtown.** Almost two leagues long from west to east, it is riddled throughout with tunnels, dungeons, storerooms, barracks, halls, stables, stairways, courtyards, balconies, and gardens. There is even a godswood of sorts, though the weirwood that grows there is a queer, twisted thing whose tangled roots have all but filled the cave where it stands, choking out all other growth.

&gt;Casterly Rock has never been taken by storm or siege. No castle in the Seven Kingdoms is larger, richer, or better defended. Legends says that Visenya Targaryen, upon seeing it, thanked the gods that King Loren rode forth to face her brother Aegon on the Field of Fire, for if he had remained within the Rock, **even dragonflame would not have daunted him.**

Hopefully Cersei makes it there after her trial and Tyrion eventually has to put his plumbing knowledge to work Lann the Clever-ing her out of it.",asoiaf
"Kinda wondering this because Stannis reminds me of Rorschach from Watchmen a lot in terms of both personality and philosophy, and Alan Moore was surprised that Rorschach was so popular because he intended him to be kinda satirical and unlikable.

"&gt;She heard a *crack*, the sound of shattering stone. The platform of wood and brush and grass began to shift and collapse in upon itself. Bits of burning wood slid down at her, and Dany was showered with ash and cinders. And something else came crashing down, bouncing and rolling, to land at her feet; a chunk of curved rock, **pale** and veined with **gold**, broken and smoking. The **roaring** filled the world, yet dimly through the firefall Dany heard women shriek and children cry out in wonder.  
&gt;  
&gt;…  
&gt;  
&gt;The dragon came down between the Dornishmen and the door with a **roar** that would have sent a **hundred lions** running.

Viserion’s scales are cream, but his horns, wing bones and spinal crest are gold colored; both colors (gold and pale cream) can be associated with Tyrion’s Lannister background and pale blonde hair. Viserion’s flame is pale gold shot through with red and orange, which looks very similar to the colors of House Lannister (gold and crimson). Following his hatching, roaring filled the world. Viserion’s roar was described to be loud enough to scare a hundred lions. Roaring is highly associated with the lion of Lannister (*Hear me roar*).

&gt;*The fool* was all that he had time to think as the quarrel caromed off Viserion’s neck to vanish in the gloom. A line of fire gleamed in its wake—dragon’s blood, glowing **gold** and **red**.  
&gt;  
&gt;The **crossbowman** was fumbling for another quarrel as the dragon’s teeth closed around his neck.

Viserion’s blood is described using the colors of House Lannister. This occurs when Viserion is fired at with a crossbow, something Tyrion has used and relates to using often throughout ADwD.

&gt;“Your asked it of me. And I have a tender spot in my heart for **cripples** and **bastards** and **broken things**.” Tyrion Lannister placed a hand over his heart and grinned.

Tyrion helped the *bastard* (Jon) and the *cripple* (Bran). Now the only thing remains is a *broken thing*. I believe Viserion will be wounded in the Battle of Meereen and Tyrion will take care of him. That is how he will bond with his dragon.

&gt;“This one understands.” Missandei turned as if to go, then paused a moment and said, “It is said that the Yunkai’i have ringed the city all about with **scorpions**, to loose **iron bolts** into the sky should Drogon return.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Ser Barristan had heard that too. “It is no simple thing to slay a dragon in the sky. In Westeros, many tried to bring down Aegon and his sisters. None succeeded.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Missandei nodded. **It was hard to tell if she was reassured.**  
&gt;  
&gt;...   
&gt;  
&gt;**Scorpions** were cranked upwards to loose **iron bolts** of the sort that had once felled Meraxes in Dorne.

Dorne is a hot and dry place full of sand. Meereen is much the same. The correct account for the death of Meraxes is that an iron bolt loosed by a scorpion slew the dragon. We don’t know much about this particular event but that must be a lucky shot. I think Viserion will get wounded by one of those iron bolts. His condition might also get worse by eating the bodies of the plague victims. This will be the time for Tyrion. He will feed mutton to the dragon, help him recover and finally bond with him similar to Nettles and Sheepstealer.

&gt;**The white** ***cyvasse*** **dragon ended up at Tyrion's feet.** He scooped it off the carpet and wiped it on his sleeve, but some of the Yunkish blood had collected in the fine grooves of the carving, so the pale wood seemed veined with red.   
&gt;  
&gt;“All hail our beloved queen, Daenerys.” *Be she alive or be she dead.* **He tossed the bloody dragon in the air**, caught it, grinned.   
&gt;  
&gt;…  
&gt;  
&gt;He moved his catapult again, closed his hand around **Tyrion’s alabaster dragon**, removed it from the board.

Viserion is the only dragon in the story that can be represented by an alabaster/white dragon cyvasse piece. Note the symbolism of Tyrion taking the bloody dragon piece from the ground, wiping it clean and tossing it to the air. It is a symbolic way of taking care of a wounded dragon and making it fly again. Not only the white dragon is said to belong to Tyrion but also it is implied that Tyrion will lose the mount at one point.",asoiaf

"Tywin was around 31 when his wife died. He was around 39 when Jaime was disinherited through the Kingsguard, leaving him with an heir he *despised.* He died around the age of 58, 27 years after Joanna's death. 

Sure he ""loved Joanna"" but apparently not enough to treat her children well, or to not have sex with Shae. And since when has Tywin been the kind of softy who would only marry for love?

Surely lords around the Seven Kingdoms would be throwing their daughters at someone as wealthy, powerful, and respected as him? He could have secured an alliance with another major house, which he has a reputation of memetic proportions for doing.

And sure he always held out hope he would get Jaime back as his heir somehow, despite the fact resignation from the Kingsguard is fairly unprecedented, but why would Tywin Lannister of all people not have a backup plan to preserve his family line and keep the dwarf from inheriting?

"Stannis acquired 4/5 of Renly's twenty thousand strong cavalry to make his 21k host. That means he got 16, 000 men from Renly. One assumes that these were the Florents and the Storm lords; who joined Stannis as their new leige lord. House florent fields 2000 men meaning Stannis got 14000 Stormlanders.

We learn that Stannis loses his men due to defections and the fact that he had to leave them behind at the Blackwater. 

Dontos tells Sansa of that the city how the city has been delivered:

&gt;“They came up through the ashes while the river was burning. The river, Stannis was neck deep in the river, and they took him from the rear. Oh, to be a knight again, to have been part of it! **His own men hardly fought, they say. Some ran but more bent the knee and went over, shouting for Lord Renly!** What must Stannis have thought when he heard that? I had it from Osney Kettleblack who had it from Ser Osmund, but Ser Balon’s back now and his men say the same, and the gold cloaks as well.

Captain Khorane told Davos of the war.

&gt;Captain Khorane had told him of the end of Stannis’s hopes, on the night the river burned. The Lannisters had taken him from the flank, and **his fickle bannermen had abandoned him by the hundreds in the hour of his greatest need.** “King Renly’s shade was seen as well,” the captain said, “slaying right and left as he led the lion lord’s van. It’s said his green armor took a ghostly glow from the wildfire, and his antlers ran with golden flames.”

Here we see that hundreds of Stannis vassals turned coat when Renly's ghost shows up.

And we later see that Stannis is left with only fifteen hundred men.

&gt;Ser Axell proposed to use Salladhor Saan’s fleet and the men who had escaped the Blackwater—Stannis still had some fifteen hundred on Dragonstone, more than half of them Florents—to exact retribution for Lord Celtigar’s defection.

So Stannis strength goes down from 21,000 to 1500. That should mean that Stannis lost most of his 14000 Stormlanders as well. Later in AFfC we see that Jaime leads a small host of less than a thousand men half of whom are lannister men and the rest being recent foes turned friends; the Stormlords like Red Ronnet, Dermot of the Rainwood and Bonnifer Hasty joining him. 

&gt;Forty knights and as many esquires awaited him outside the Red Keep’s stables. Half were westermen sworn to House Lannister, the others recent foes turned doubtful friends. Ser Dermot of the Rainwood would carry Tommen’s standard, Red Ronnet Connington the white banner of the Kingsguard.

And 

&gt;The greater part of his command awaited him beyond the city walls; Ser Addam Marbrand with his outriders, Ser Steffon Swyft and the baggage train, the Holy Hundred of old Ser Bonifer the Good, Sarsfield’s mounted archers, Maester Gulian with four cages full of ravens, two hundred heavy horse under Ser Flement Brax. Not a great host, all in all; fewer than a thousand men in total. Numbers were the last thing needed at Riverrun.

Jaime III.

So that accounts for only about five hundred Stormlanders. We know that Stannis should have a few(less than 750) of the Stormlands horse in his 1500. We also know that the Stormland infantry remained with the sixty thousand that Loras takes for his own host. We however don't see what becomes of rest of them. 

So where are the rest of the Stormlanders now?",asoiaf

&gt;GRRM had no problem with Elio's design of House Vance heraldry, where the dragons have four legs, instead of two legs like the Targ dragons. He might even come up with the suggestion that possibly there had once been a breed of dragon that had four legs. Though Elio didn't remember clearly that's George or his own suggestion.

&gt;*Is braavos more like venice or rhodes?*  
&gt;  
&gt;A bit of both, actually, with some of Amsterdam and Bruges thrown in as well. Mix with some London fog, stir, and serve over eel-infested canal water.

* CCCB Kosmopolis Interview [July 2012](https://vimeo.com/51124293)

&gt;*The meaning of ice and fire?*  
&gt;  
&gt;Well, ice is frozen water. And fire, fire is the result of combustion when a substance unites with oxygen and gives off heat and energy. But are they hate and love and these other things? Yeah of course. I'm working on a number of levels there and I've always loved a certain amount of ambiguity words or scenes or sequences, and books that can be read in many different ways, that have several meanings when you look at them, that mean one thing when you look at them this way, and another thing when you're looking them the other way. Ice and fire course are also opposites, they're a duality and there's a lot in my books that are about duality. Certainly the religion of Melisandre, one of the most important characters, I think is basically a dualist religion with the premise that there are two gods. It's somewhat based on Zoroastrianism, and a little bit based on Catharism, Albigenses heresy who I know had some roots here in Spain once upon a time, before they were all killed. The idea of a world divided between good and evil war between the two, which is so basic to so many fantasy starting with Tolkien, but much more so in the case of Tolkien imitators, was something that I wanted to recast and think about and maybe subvert a little. But I'm still using kind of the language of it, and some of the symbols associated with it. So all of these are grist for the mill, it's not something as simple as saying ice is this and fire is that. They're both many things. **And one of the most important things is that both of them, ice and fire will kill you dead.** So they're both dangerous in their own ways, hate, love, desire, coldness, they can both be deadly.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Game is one of the themes central to the song of ice and fire, and I would like you to talk about that idea of ​​playing and also playing with readers*  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes it's true. I've played games all my life from when I was a child growing up in Bayonne New Jersey. I played checkers and Monopoly and later on chess. I got to be quite good at chess or relatively good at chess and so much so that I was captain of the chess team in college, and then for few years when I got out of college I made my living directing chess tournaments. In more recent decades I got involved with role-playing games and had a whole group in in Albuquerque New Mexico once had to say where I live of other writers that I did bro playing games with Melinda Snodgrass, Walter John Williams, Victor Milan, the late great Roger Zelazny, all of them were were part of my gaming group at various points . I mean you haven't lived until you've role played with Roger Zelazny. And the wild card series that I've edited for more than 20 years grew out of that. Games have figured in much of my fiction, I've written a couple of chess stories, and of course I have titled *A Game of Thrones* ""A Game of Thrones"". I've also titled the overall series of course *A Song of Ice and Fire.* Song is another motif that's occurred in a lot of my titles, going all the way back to *A Song for Lya*and *Songs of Stars and Shadows* and etc etc. We played a lot of games as human beings. Politics, I think, is. Someone once described it as the most exciting game there is. Speaking of chess, there used to be a fashion among the royalty of Europe to have chess games with living pieces, where the French kings, and perhaps the Spanish kings for all I knew, would dress up their courtiers as kings and queens, and have a huge chess board set up on a lawn and move the pieces around, and have a living chess game. I actually did that myself. My fans put together one of those at the worldcon in California a few years ago, and they dressed it up as one side was the Dornish and the other side was the Tyrells of Highgarden. And Daniel Abraham and I were the two players, and we moved the pieces around, and I won. But that's almost a metaphor, I mean, the truth is that kings and presidents and premiers and prime ministers and all of our leaders from time immemorial have played real games, games of power in which the stakes are human lives and the destiny of nations. And you know, games are sort of formalized competition, but our lives are a competition. and I certainly try to reflect that in in my writing and in something like Ice and Fire. Tyrion is acutely aware of it, you know, he despite being born to a position of power and and wealth, he's aware that, he's competing for everything there is, and he has to be on his toes at all time. and I see that in life too, so I do try to reflect it in my in my books.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Why choose love as the topic of* Dying of the Light *to start your career?*  
&gt;  
&gt;I think it does have something to do with who we are or who I am, and the experiences that a writer undergoes in his own life. There may be some aspiring writers in this group who wanted to do novels or short stories of your own. One of the things that you will probably hear from a lot of teachers and people who give advice to aspiring writers is, write what you know. At least in in the United States, in English literature, this is something always said to aspiring writers: write what you know. When I was a young writer I hated hearing that, because I didn't know anything really. I was this kid from the projects in Bayonne New Jersey. I had never gone anywhere, and didn't have any money. I wanted to write fantasy and science fiction, but I had certainly never seen a dragon, I'd never gone to another planet, I've never done any of this stuff, so how could I write what I know? So I sort of rejected that and said, well, that's bullshit, I'm not gonna follow that advice. But later, and when I eventually became a writer, I began to understand the truth of that. It's not writing what you know in terms of the care and raising of dragons, it's writing the emotional truth of your own life, and whatever furniture you may put into your story, whether it's a realistic story about what it's like to live in Barcelona in the year 2012 and the day-to-day struggles of life, or whether you're casting it in in a historical context what it was like to live in Spain in 1492, or whatever when the Moors were being kicked out and the Jews were being kicked out and Columbus was discovering America, or whether it's a far distant planet or a fantasy world, the core of it is still what you know in terms of emotional truth. That's what's gonna make the characters come alive, that's what's gonna make it real. Now I have a friend, a contemporary who served in the United States Armed Forces during the Vietnam War, and he had some very traumatic experiences over there. He saw some horrible things, he did some things, he learned a lot about war and the nature of humanity, and it's clear that this these events that happened to him between, you know, roughly the ages of 18 and 22 or 23, became in some ways the defining characteristic of his life, and he has subsequently written a number of books. And some of them are realistic books novels about the Vietnam War novels, about coming home after the Vietnam War, some of them are science fiction books of other wars in a thousand years from now among the stars. But you can read those are the war, those science-fiction books, and you can see that the power in them derives from the fact that he served in the Vietnam War, and he knows what he was talking about, that a core of emotional truth there he's writing what he knows. he's writing from the heart. or from the gut as you might say. and that's what makes his best work so powerful. When he doesn't write about war, I think he produces some very entertaining books, but they don't necessarily have the same power as when he's writing about the subject that he really knows. (*Ed. note: I guess he's Joe Haldeman*) Which brings me back to me, who did not serve in the Vietnam War, who in fact was part of the anti-war movement resisting it. I was at home, I went to college and then I got out of college, and the big defining characteristics of my life in these periods was I had a number of women who broke my heart, and it seems very trivial compared to serving in the Vietnam War, but boy it didn't feel trivial to me and I...the questions of love and romance and sexuality and existential loneliness occupied my mind, and obsessed me for years. And as a result I produced a series of intensely romantic science fiction, short stories and novels about guys who are getting their hearts broken among the stars, including *Dying of the Light,* which i think is the ultimate example of it. So I too was writing what you know, the emotional heart of the book goes back to write what you know.

* *Deeper than Swords* Event [March 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiBPX6ChdtI)

&gt;*What is the state of book technology in Westeros? We see a lot of books, we see paper and volume. Does printing exist or all books written by hand?*  
&gt;  
&gt;Printing does not exist yet, no. It's still all, you know, monks copying things over by hand. Um, we still have a Dark Ages technology, I suppose Dark Ages heading into Middle Ages, um, with some ancient scrolls. Some books are still on scrolls and agree libraries, um, and some are being, uh, now bound and bound in leather. So what we would recognize as ancient books, but it's still more in the illuminated a kind of manuscript stage. There's a larger issue there, which is the in general technology of Westeros. And people have asked me about that, why given this long history as Westeros is so relatively backward, and you know, obviously my answer is that the seasons have a large part of it. When periodically winter comes along and thousands of people starve to death and you know, there's this immensely ruling winter in, you don't know that it's ever going to end. That's going to have an effect on the advancement of progress, so to speak. So that's certainly a part of it. Medical technology is a little more advanced actually, thanks to the order of the maesters.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Well maybe we'll get someone with a printing press coming in from Asshai or something?*  
&gt;  
&gt;That could be, there are various technological levels in Westeros too, according to where you are. I mean, the North, the Stark levels is actually more primitive. When you get down to the Reach and King's Landing, they have much more elaborate armor. They have plate and mail as opposed to a straight chain mail in the North. And then of course, if you get beyond the Wall, they're pretty well Stone Age though, their axes made of stone and then bone, and boiled leather outfits except what they can steal from people that they've killed. And you're seeing an across the narrow sea and the cities of the east and all that. Also, once again, different technological levels, which I think some writers forget about and fantasy. And I tried not to forget about it. I mean, we still have, we live in 21st century America, and we're pretty advanced. But you know, I did a shoot in Morocco, when I visited a shooting in Morocco a few years ago and went into Marrakesh, and you get in the inside of Marrakesh, you don't feel that you're in the 21st century. You feel it, you know, Ali Baba and the 40 thieves, we're right around the corner there. And we still have Stone Age tribes in Papua New Guinea. So even on today's earth, hidden in this age of social media and computers and television, the global societies is not a global society, are still pockets of different technological levels that exist all over the earth. And that's certainly much true in Westeros and Essos and my world in general. I'm showing in some of Arya chapters that I've written for the book, you see that in Braavos there a little more advanced with stage of drama. They're actually developing the Elizabethan stage play, you know, fully acted play as well. Back in Westeros proper, you still got mummers hitting each other would bladders and running around and doing forces. But they're looking for Shakespeare and Marlowe in Braavos and some of the other Free Cities. So that's why I'm trying to get to this kind of suggestion of a world with many different societies and many different cultures where things are in a constant state of change.

&gt;*What did Littlefinger do during Robert's Rebellion?*  
&gt;  
&gt;He was probably back on his own land. I mean, he had been wounded, you know, quite seriously in his duel with Brandon Stark only shortly before that, and he was actually close to death. There took a long time to recover, and you know that he got thrown out because Hoster tell they didn't like him fooling around with the daughters, so...

* GOT 307 Commentary Track. Feb 2014

&gt;Scenes not in GRRM's original script: Robb &amp; Talisa, Joff &amp; Tywin, Jaime &amp; Brienne, Theon &amp; Ramsay  
&gt;  
&gt;Scenes in GRRM's original script but got moved to the next episode: Dany met with the sellsword company, Sam &amp; Gilly met the Others.  
&gt;  
&gt;The original script title was *Autumn Storms,* and there was rain and practically every scene which replicates what's going on in the books about this point. As people are marching, there's snow in the north, and further south there's pouring driving rains, the rivers are overflowing, their banks the roads are turning to seas of mud. All of this is slowing down people. And of course we have a lot of scenes in the rain. After the shot, Dan Weiss called me up and said, ""Do something about that title George, we didn't actually have any rain.""...And then for a while this episode was titled *Chains,* after the golden chain Tyrion gives Shae and the affected Gendry's in chains and Jon is kind of in a quasi prisoner thing with the wildling, so there was a lot of imprisonment themed going on. But once we move the the bear fight into this episode, you know, *the bear and the maiden fair* is the obvious and overwhelming title choice, the other titles went away.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[On Gendry &amp; Mel scene\] In the books Gendry remains with the Brotherhood without banners continuously, because Robert the late King, his father had many bastards, and one of them is already on Dragonstone, a character named Edric Storm. Dave &amp; Dan simplifying it, combined the function of Gendry and Edric storm, eliminating the Edric Storm character, which means that Melisandre had to go and get Gendry. So we had that scene in the previous episode where she shows up on horseback and takes him. This scene was in my episode where they come back, and I decided to add the ship sequence.The only way for her to possibly get from Dragonstone deep into the heart of Riverlands was going by ship upriver, and I liked a visual of them coming back and passing the Red Keep, the irony of it, where people been there searching for him there for ages, and now he's passing right under their nose and they have no idea. And then the visual of the castle gave a great way to sell their relationship in a kind of dramatic way.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[On Theon scene\] I have absolutely nothing to do with these Theon scenes. In the books Theon is tortured for years, but he essentially disappears at the end of Book II and doesn't reappear to the beginning of Book V, by which time he's transformed into Reek. So there's some mention in flashback and dialogue of the fact that he's been tortured for several years and essentially broken down. His whole personality broken down and he's lost various bits of his body, some of his teeth, some of his fingers and toes, **other parts, well, I I leave that a little more to the imagination than what we're about to see here**. So now this scene was a hundred percent David and Dan.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[The director said when they filmed that scene, they got into trouble as one of the girls was found to have a Brazilian. And she thought Westeros shouldn't has that tech.\] They do have razors in the Middle Ages. So it's all a matter of fashion and culture. And this of course is a fantasy world, so we don't have to actually match to actual medieval cultures. We have different religions and different gods and different sexual patterns, so anything is possible if we say it's possible, I guess.  
&gt;  
&gt;Osha's backstory of Bruni is something that David and Dan have added. but I suspect that her story in the books is somewhat similar, she just doesn't even talk about it.

* Le Mouv Interview [July 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oqRdBmIwNA)

&gt;*In Game of Thrones, there are battles, wars, blood, violence but it is not that through which the essential story is played out. Everything \[in the story\] plays out through ruses, treason, intelligence – it is our history really.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Oh although it all interests me. I mean battles and Wars interests me - and medieval feasts interest me. And you know I'm creating a whole world here and every facet of it. As I get to it I try to approach it as realistically as I can, but ultimately as I said before, it's it's the human heart in conflict with itself. It's what makes Cersei Lannister the way she is, and is she capable of learning and changing? What drives Dany? With Dany I'm particularly looking at the what effect great power has upon a person. She's the mother of dragons, and she controls what is in effect the only three nuclear weapons in the entire world that I've created . What does it do to you when you control the only three nuclear weapons in the world and you can destroy entire cities or cultures if you choose to? Should you choose to, should you not choose to? These are the issues that fascinate me. I don't necessarily claim to have answers to these. I think exploring the questions is far more interesting than just me giving an answer and saying to the reader, here's the answer, here's the truth. Now think about it for yourself, look at the dilemmas, look at the contradictions, look at the problems, and the unintended consequences. That's what fascinates me.

* Al Jazeera Interview [Nov 2014](http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/talk-to-al-jazeera/articles/2014/11/13/george-rr-martintalkstodavidshuster.html)

&gt;*For people who are not familiar with your work, the series takes place in an imaginary world. There is a struggle for control of the kingdom. This dynastic war is essentially one of three main plot lines. There are the other plot lines involving these sort of superhuman characters, and then there’s the exiled Targaryen daughter who seeks the return of her ancient throne. Why those three main plot lines?*  
&gt;  
&gt;Well, of course, the two outlying ones — the things going on north of the Wall, and then there is Targaryen on the other continent with her dragons — are of course the ice and fire of the title, “A Song of Ice and Fire.” The central stuff — the stuff that’s happening in the middle, in King’s Landing, the capital of the seven kingdoms — is much more based on historical events, historical fiction. It’s loosely drawn from the Wars of the Roses and some of the other conflicts around the 100 Years’ War, although, of course, with a fantasy twist. You know, one of the dynamics I started with, there was the sense of people being so consumed by their petty struggles for power within the seven kingdoms, within King’s Landing — who’s going to be king? Who’s going to be on the Small Council? Who’s going to determine the policies? — that they’re blind to the much greater and more dangerous threats that are happening far away on the periphery of their kingdoms.And of course, you can see that all through history. It’s a common dynamic that takes place in history. You know, the Greek city-states, before the birth of Christ, you know, and fighting with each other, squabbling with each other, even as Philip of Macedon built up his armies to conquer them all. But you even see it in modern times, you know — the political struggles of France, under the Third Republic, while the Nazi threat is rising.But the French politicians would almost rather befriend the Nazis than each other. And maybe our lessons in the modern day too. Who knows? I mean, we have things going on in our world right now like climate change, that’s, you know, ultimately a threat to the entire world. But people are using it as a political football instead of, you know … You’d think everybody would get together.This is something that can wipe out possibly the human race. So I wanted to do an analogue not specifically to the modern-day thing but as a general thing with the structure of the book.

* Inside HBO's Game of Thrones Season 3&amp;4 [Nov 2014](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L5WS12G/)

&gt;I knew years before I got to the scene that Robb was going to die. From the beginning he was marked for death. People have said that he should have been a POV character and in retrospect maybe he should have been, because then it would have been even more of a shock, but I always knew he was going to die. I wanted to deconstruct the usual fantasy thing and I had already killed Ned. In 90 percent of fantasies the father is murdered and the son picks up his mantle and avenges him. I wanted a switch, where you seem to be getting the heroic son, but whoops—he’s dead, too. **While writing, I made some other decisions about that scene. Catelyn was going to have to die and the army needed to be destroyed, too.** (*Ed. note: in the 1993 outline, Robb and Cat died at different time.*)When it comes to influences, I avoid looking at a single historical reference or person to create something like Slaver’s Bay. There are certainly elements from the Babylonian and Mesopotamian societies of ancient times. There are Carthaginian and ancient Persian factors. And of course, there is a good deal of purely imaginative creation. The trick is to blend them all together to construct a world that is entirely your own.

&gt;When the question arose about the dragon dance and the dragons killed each other, a subtle hint from GRRM came along that **perhaps this could happen in the current event** as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;Q: One author said, ""the dragon stories are true, not because they show that dragons exist, but because they show that dragons can be defeated."" Is this also a summary of the plot of ASOIF?  
&gt;  
&gt;A: Well, Dany certainly does not agree that dragons can be defeated. Well, **maybe we will know that in the future**.Then GRRM leans back and does not say anything for a few moments.

&gt;Jaime was with Jon Darry when Chelsted died. Then Jon died at the Trident, so it’s a month from Chelsted’s death to Rosssart’s. But in Jamie’s memory Rossart was Hand for a fortnight.Elio discussed the isssue with Anne and George, ""we did in fact stick with Rossart being made Hand after the Trident... but it is *not* explcitly coupled with the date of Chelsted's ﻿death. That is, the solution we struck upon is that Chelsted was killed and for a period of time there was no Hand until the Trident, when Aerys appointed Rossart. Presumably this was part and parcel of Aerys's conflict with his son, that he refused to name him (perhaps he dangled it in front of him if he won against Robert) or anyone else, and only chose a Hand when Rhaegar was dead.""

"There are so many wonderful characters in The World of Ice and Fire (not the book but the universe itself). I’m curious as to some of the community’s favorite minor or overlooked characters and why.

Rereading the series I’ve realized how I’d overlooked Rodrick Harlaw, The Reader. Among some delusional and many shortsighted Ironmen Rodrick is quite unique as a lover of the written word. He gives probably the most sage political advice of any of the Ironborn I’ve seen. He rightly told Asha she would fail at the Kingsmoot and defines the need of the Ironborn in practical terms, that is to say land and not Kings. He counsels taking advantage of the political turmoil on the mainland to bring benefit to the Islands, instead of further fruitless attempts at bringing back the Old Ways. Of course it remains to be seen what Euron or Vic will achieve, but this struck me as a uniquely wise viewpoint among the otherwise mostly predictable Ironborn.

He doesn’t get enough love and I wish he had a larger role to play in the series. 

Any other minor characters you think greatly add to the richness of the world building, and who stand out especially?",asoiaf
"In book 1-5 and show season 1-6, there are always 2 distinct and parallel storylines: Westeros and Essos. The former involved majority of characters and the latter is just about Dany/different people's journey to find her.  
  
However, the last scene in the show about Essos was in S6E10, when Dany appointed Tyrion as her Hand. Then they left Meereen, not a single mention of Essos, Essosi characters at all in S7 and S8.  
  
My issue with that setting is, it single-handed made Dany's character discontinuous. We can even see the ""Essos Dany plotline"" and ""Westeros Dany plotline"" as two separate TV shows, without having any significant impact to both stories. We never know what is her legacy left in the history of Slaver's Bay, Volantis, and the religion of Lord of Light. The short term effect seemed negative, given the ""living hell"" situation of Astapor and the entire siege and plague subplot, but what about long-term?  
  
When we look back at all the 3 season of Meereen plot, we may ask ourselves: ""what's the point of this? We saw no consequences of how society changed after season 6 battle, so we supposed to believe everlasting peace and harmony in Bay of Dragons for a thousand years? I don't think so, if not, why not show how Meereen returned into turmoil, after all, season 8 need something to paint Dany in bad light for her villain plot, the aftermath of Meereen is a golden opportunity and the show missed it.  
  
It is obvious now Samwell Tarly's history book since death of king Robert, A song of Ice and Fire will record the truth of Queen Daenerys Targaryen as a ruthless mass murderer. Westerosi historians in the Citadel will not be kind to her, as she will be remembered as such for generations to come, and rightfully so.  
  
But what about the historical memory in the East?  
  
Take examples from how history textbooks are written in the real world, I predict another biased side of narrators. Large statues and monuments will be built (maybe on top of the Meereen Pyramids? That sounds cool) and historical narratives describe Daenerys as a flawless heroine died in mystery/betrayed by evil Westerosi lords. How would those people in the eastern continent react to Dany's death and her so-called ""mad queen"" reputation in the west? I'm very curious to know. They may just dismiss burning of King's landing as unreliable rumours and Westerosi propaganda, consider how information was perceived in such far away locations, most of the commoners will never know what happened to their queen and how did her die.  
  
There are endless possibilities, unfortunately, the show never provided a satisfying conclusion to that. My question is, will GRRM mention the “aftermath” of Essos, since the Essos plot line is much more complex in the books.  
  
Bu the end of ADWD, millions the salves across the continent already heard the name of Daenerys Targaryen, what she had done in Meereen, and the long-time ""butterfly effect"" is much more than just a few red priests preaching to the crowd. All details indicate those slave cities are on the edge of rebellion. Remember the widow of the waterfront of Volantis, in ADWD: Tyrion VII?  
  
&gt; ""Oh, I think it will be war as well, but not the war they want."" The old woman leaned forward, her black eyes gleaming. ""I think that red R'hllor has more worshipers in this city than all the other gods together. Have you heard Benerro preach?""  
  
&gt; ""Last night.""
  
&gt; ""Benerro can see the morrow in his flames,"" the widow said. ""Triarch Malaquo tried to hire the Golden Company, did you know? He meant to clean out the red temple and put Benerro to the sword. He dare not use tiger cloaks. Half of them worship the Lord of Light as well. Oh, these are dire days in Old Volantis, even for wrinkled old widows. But not half so dire as in Meereen, I think. So tell me, ser … why do you seek the silver queen?""  
  
&gt; ""That is my concern. I can pay for our passage and pay well. I have the silver.""  
  
&gt; Fool, thought Tyrion. It's not coin she wants, it's respect. Haven't you heard a word she's said?  
  
&gt; ""Should you reach your queen, give her a message from the slaves of Old Volantis."" She touched the faded scar upon her wrinkled cheek, where her tears had been cut away. **""Tell her we are waiting. Tell her to come soon.""**  
  
Since we all know how the whole story ends, I simply cannot forget this chapter. It is straight up depressing, **The slaves of Volantis will never saw their long-waited imagery liberator to come**. According to the show season 7-8, it turns out all the build up in the east didn't matter at all, Daenerys will become what she would end up with or without the ""learning how to rule"" plot in Meereen, defeating the whole point of Meereenese Knot.",asoiaf
"I think before I say anything else - this was the most spectacular, wonderfully inquizitive, Brilliant book &amp; could not put it down, I read the last six chapter(Sansa VI - Daenerys X) in a single sitting, and wholly fuck!


With regards to Daenerys IX - Chapter 68. The fact that I already know, by the series and reading as such, knowing how Kal Drogo dies, it still felt so fucking real on the page. But, and I don't know how much it's been talked about(probably ad nauseum) all the dreams and hallucinations of her son and the other dead Targeryens. The fact she sees herself flying on a dragon and burning what can only be King's Landing,(I know there were a few more but forgot, should have reread that chapter before hand) does none of this bare or contradict the visions she has in the House Of the Undying? I always hear and read about those visions and almost never these ones. I'll just say that was one of my favourite chapters thus far in the book. As a caveat, I'll say the last Catelyn chapter(71, Catelyn XI) had me so fucking pumped up when the Greatjon stood there, great sword raised and proclaims Robb, ""King In The North"". (p.s. for some reason, I know she's a smaller character, but I'm loving Maege Mormont. Loving Jeor &amp; Jorah! Goddman are the Mormont's fucking spectacularly written!).   

Now, as with the finale chapter - Daenerys X. I don't know how the rest of you read but, it was if she wasn't sure about stepping into the fire at first, but when she did it was such a great read. I love that it was basically an entire chapter, dedicated of the most important decision in the books!  

P.S. Onto ACoK!",asoiaf
" A Game of Thrones - Eddard III
There was something slung over the back of his destrier, a heavy shape wrapped in a bloody cloak. ""No sign of your daughter, Hand,"" the Hound rasped down, ""but the day was not wholly wasted.

Bending, Ned pulled back the cloak, dreading the words he would have to find for Arya, but it was not Nymeria after all. It was the butcher's boy, Mycah, his body covered in dried blood. He had been cut almost in half from shoulder to waist by some terrible blow struck from above.

"Just officially finished my first re-read. All in all, much more satisfying than the first read, after having read tons of external material from the fandom. It gave me a better appreciation for storylines that just didn't interest me the first time through.

Getting to the Epilogue, wow. I think there's tons of stuff hidden in here, but I enjoyed it so much that I immediately read it again as soon as I finished. So, I'd like to comment about a few of the notes I took on this chapter the 2nd time around.

One thing I noticed was how similar Cersei and Kevan's inner dialogue is about other characters. Not similar in that they think the same things, but that they think other things about these people, but then say something else aloud. The difference being, Cersei's inner dialogue is usually very hateful towards the person. I think it gives a nice contrast between two characters who aimed to be just like Tywin, with neither being an accurate depiction.

&gt;Mace Tyrell was no more than ten years older than Cersei, yet she thought of him as her father’s age, not her own. He was not quite so tall as Lord Tywin had been, but elsewise he was bigger, with a thick chest and a gut grown even thicker. His hair was chestnut-colored, but there were specks of white and grey in his beard. His face was often red. “Lord Tywin was a great man, an *extraordinary* man,” he declared ponderously after he had kissed both her cheeks. “We shall never see his like again, I fear.” 

&gt;*You are looking at his like, fool*, Cersei thought. *It is his daughter standing here before you*. But she needed Tyrell and the strength of Highgarden to keep Tommen on his throne, so all she said was, “He will be greatly missed.”**-Cersei AFFC**

&gt;Tyrell gave a grudging nod. “As you say. My Margaery prefers to be tried by the Faith, so the whole realm can bear witness to her innocence.”

&gt;*If your daughter is as innocent as you’d have us believe, why must you have your army present when she faces her accusers*? Ser Kevan might have asked. “Soon, I hope,” he said instead, before turning to Grand Maester Pycelle. “Is there aught else?” **-Epilogue ADWD**

There's numerous instances of this, mostly about Mace Tyrell, in the Epilogue.

&gt;""...And now we have reports that Connington is moving on Storm’s End.” 

&gt;“If it is Jon Connington,” said Randyll Tarly.

Numerous times Randall Tarly brings up the question of Aegon's legitimacy. I think this is a subtle nod to the fact that Randall will likely support Aegon when he lands, especially after everything in KL has gone to shit. One thing to look out for is when a character tries to write off someone or something, as if to get the other characters to doubt it and just ignore it. I think Tarly is trying to do that here.

&gt;Behind the table where the five members of the king’s small council were seated, **the Iron Throne crouched like some great black beast, its barbs and claws and blades half-shrouded in shadow**. Kevan Lannister could feel it at his back, an itch between the shoulder blades.

I just think this is an interesting description of the Iron Throne. Could it point to anything?

&gt;“At the far end of the world,” said Mace Tyrell. “Queen of Slaver’s Bay, aye. She is welcome to it.”

&gt;“On that we can agree,” Ser Kevan said, “but the girl is of the blood of Aegon the Conqueror, and I do not think she will be content to remain in Meereen forever. If she should reach these shores and join her strength to Lord Connington and this prince of his, feigned or no … **we must destroy Connington and his pretender now, before Daenerys Stormborn can come west.”**

I was asking myself, why Varys would want Kevan and Pycelle dead. Sure, Pycelle gives him ""for the good of the realm/children"" speech as he is dying, but numerous people have questioned Varys' motives in that regard.

I can't help but think one of the main reasons Varys throws a wrench into the system is because he does not think Aegon can outright win against the Iron Throne as it stands. Kevan was going to wipe the plate with him.

&gt;he would have no choice but to pay the crown’s debts with Lannister gold. He dare not resort to new taxes, not with the Seven Kingdoms crawling with rebellion.

This mirrors what Tywin Lannister did when he was Hand off the King to Aerys. Though, probably for very different reasons.

&gt;The Grand Maester consulted his papers. “We should address the **Rosby inheritance. Six claims have been put forth**—”

I'm sure this has been discussed in detail, but who are the claimants?

The next thing I noticed is how differently Kevan notes Cersei is acting.

&gt;His niece had been subdued and submissive since her walk of atonement, thank the gods.

Then,

&gt;...she spent a third of her waking hours with her son, another third in prayer, and the rest in her tub. **She was bathing four or five times a day, scrubbing herself with horsehair brushes and strong lye soap**, as if she meant to scrape her skin off.

That's a peculiar act.

But let's not forget what her appearance is like now.

&gt;The queen was dressed as modestly as any matron, in a dark brown gown that buttoned up to her throat and a hooded green mantle that covered her shaved head.

[Well then.](https://youtu.be/wSJSWy2o_1I)

&gt;Ser Boros Blount was in attendance on the boy king and his mother when Ser Kevan entered the royal chambers. Blount wore enameled scale, white cloak, and halfhelm. He did not look well. Of late Boros had grown notably heavier about the face and belly, and his color was not good. And he was leaning against the wall behind him, as if standing had become too great an effort for him.

Then we have the obvious, slow poisoning of Ser Boros Blount.... Or he's just gaining weight and becoming unhealthy because he has to taste all of Tommen's food, which is mostly sweets?

&gt;“The bad cat was outside my window last night,” he informed Kevan at one point, “but Ser Pounce hissed at him and he ran off across the roofs.” 

&gt;“The bad cat?” Ser Kevan said, amused. He is a sweet boy. 

&gt;“An old black tomcat with a torn ear,” Cersei told him. “A filthy thing, and foul-tempered. He clawed Joff’s hand once.” She made a face. “The cats keep the rats down, I know, but that one … **he’s been known to attack ravens in the rookery.”**

Here, the famous black cat, Baleron, shows up once again. I know there's theories about the cat having been skin-changed by someone, but I also wonder if that someone mistrusted the Maesters? Who could that be? And on that note, is Ser Pounce also skin-changed by someone, or are these cats metaphorical foreshadowing of some future event?

&gt;“Your wife … do you mean to bring her to court?”

Cersei is interested if Kevan's wife will join them at court. Why is this?

After his supper with Cersei, they are interrupted by a page informing him that Pycelle has a message for him. The first thing Kevan sees is the large, white raven of the Citadel. Intended to announce the changing of the seasons.

However, it donned on me, that no one at KL, besides Varys and his Little Birds, knows that it is now Winter. Just a little tidbit I was wondering if it would mean anything.

&gt;He stood in a pool of shadow by a bookcase, plump, pale-faced, round-shouldered, clutching a crossbow in soft powdered hands. Silk slippers swaddled his feet.

This description of Varys gave me chills. What a truly terrifying sight. You've just been shot in the chest, and here stands the plump former Master of Whispers, who couldn't hurt a fly, wielding the crossbow that hit you. With powdered hands and slippered feet. 

&gt;Someone somewhere will find a way to blame the Dornishmen.

During his King Aegon speech, Varys says this line about what will happen as a result of Kevan's death. I wonder who will blame the Dornish and what it will mean?

Anyway, this chapter was an absolute delight on my second time around. At a time where I was just trying to finish my re-read, this chapter really made me stop and slow down again, and look at the details.

Tldr: A few tidbits of information that I thought may be suspect in the Epilogue. Feel free to address any or all of them. No real angle.",asoiaf
"I think the UnKiss and Sansa's belief of old songs such as those about Florian and Jonquil at face value are related. I think Sansa finds it difficult to distinguish fantasy from reality, even where her own memories are concerned.",asoiaf
"This is something that has been on my mind for a while and I'd like to hear other's thoughts. They obviously cut and changed a large portion of Jaime's story for the show, while Cersei's, and Tyrion's to some extent, have followed the books much more closely. But they cut the valonqar prophecy (and left the other parts of the prophecy in), which is pretty integral to the dynamic between the three Lannister siblings.

So does this mean something? Is the valonqar prophecy ultimately so meaningless in the books that it wasn't in the show? Or is it going to end up being *very* important in the books and couldn't be properly explained in the show's shortened time frame (not that they cared about properly explaining everything else)?

I lean more toward it being important because, again, it so heavily influences Cersei's choices. You could argue that almost everything she's done has been about preventing that prophecy from coming true.

Prior to season 8 I would have said that it was omitted because GRRM wanted to have it be one ""oh shit"" moment that wasn't in the show first. However, Jon killing Dany was an ""oh shit"" moment (or it was supposed to be had it been properly executed) that is just as big, if not bigger, than someone strangling Cersei. So it doesn't really make sense that Jon killing Dany would be included but Jaime (or Tyrion or whoever) killing Cersei wouldn't be.

&gt;""You make too much of that boy. Your little wife has filled your head with foolish notions of his prowess, I know, but Osmund Kettleblack is thrice the knight that Loras is.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Jaime laughed. ""Not the Osmund Kettleblack I know.""  
&gt;  
&gt;She could have throttled him. *Perhaps I need to command Ser Loras to allow Ser Osmund to unhorse him. That might chase the stars from Tommen's eyes. Salt a slug and shame a hero, and they shrink right up.* ""I am sending for a Dornishman to train you,"" she said. ""The Dornish are the finest jousters in the realm.""  
&gt;  
&gt; ""They are not,"" said Tommen. ""Anyway, I don't want any stupid Dornishman, I want Ser Loras. I command it.""

&gt;Jaime laughed. *He is no help at all. Does he think this is amusing?* The queen slapped the water angrily. ""Must I send for Pate? You do not command me. I am your mother.""  
&gt;

&gt;Jaime was still laughing. The queen ignored him. ""Tommen, come here."" When he hung back, she sighed. ""Are you afraid? A king should not show fear."" The boy approached the tub, his eyes downcast. She reached out and stroked his golden curls. ""King or no, you are a little boy. Until you come of age, the rule is mine. You will learn to joust, I promise you. But not from Loras. The knights of the Kingsguard have more important duties than playing with a child. Ask the Lord Commander. Isn't that so, ser?""

"I got the book like three weeks ago and I'm moving it, the lore in this world is fascinating, and experiencing it by reading it instead of watching YouTube videos like I used to is a feeling I had been missing for the last few years. 

That said, nothing break the immersion more than errors in translation, of which this book has a lot of, to have to double check with the source material. I don't know if there's a more recent edition of the book, but the page with the information ok my book had 2019 as a date. I know this might be a minor gripe, but if I wasn't aware of it I would have gone my whole life thinking that Fairmarket was in the Green Fork instead of the Blue Fork because the book in Spanish said so.

"Having Tyrion smirk instead of getting shocked when Dany starts to burn Kings Landing. This would indicate he plotted the fall of Kings Landing long before that moment because he despised the people of Kings Landing after his trial. He purposely gave Dany bad advice to drive her mad and then made Jon kill her. After this, he got himself a puppet king that doesn't care about ruling the country so he can rule it himself. He literally became the new Tywin. Tywin was also the decision-maker behind the puppet king Joffrey.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw a post about Tyrion actually being a villain in the story in this sub and I thought maybe Tyrion giving Dany such bad advice is not about him being incompetent but him plotting against her. Can this be a direction that Tyrion's character can take in the books? Because he is obviously whitewashed in the show compared to his book version.",asoiaf
"In order to guess how the Dornish wars might take place in the upcoming Dance of Dragons between fAegon and Dany, we might consider some conflicts where Dorne faced dragons.

**Round 1**

&gt;“When the Young Dragon conquered Dorne, he used a **goat track** to bypass the Dornish watchtowers on the Boneway.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“I know that tale as well, but Daeron made too much of it in that vainglorious book of his. Ships won that war, not goat tracks. Oakenfist broke the Planky Town and swept halfway up the **Greenblood** whilst the main Dornish strength was engaged in the **Prince’s Pass**.”

While the main Dornish strength was engaged in the Dornish Passes, Oakenfist attacked Planky Town and swept up the Greenblood, which was one of the main reasons of the victory. But the goat tracks are also important because Robb defeated the army of Stafford by the goat track Grey Wind had found and Stannis himself took Deepwood Motte by following mostly the goat tracks.

The idea here is clear.

1. Traditionally, the Dornish use their own terrain to their advantage but an unaccounted path like the goat track of the Young Dragon might undo their strategy.
2. Dorne never had a naval power since Nymeria burned her ships. This was a mistake. Greenblood is the life blood of Dorne and Dorne is very vulnerable to an attack to Planky Town. Of course the mouth of the river is not completely undefended but a strong fleet with an able captain can crush them and open the way to the heart of Dorne.

Dragons win.

**Round 2**

&gt;“*\[Trystane\]* always sets his squares up the same way, with all the mountains in the front and his **elephants in the passes**,” said Myrcella. “So I send my dragon through to eat his elephants.”

Trystane plays cyvasse according to traditional Dornish tactics. He deploys his main strength in the passes and relies on impassable mountains and the terrain. However, a dragon can fly over the mountains and this is how Trystane is defeated every time.

Their cyvasse game is a representation of the Young Dragon and Dornish forces in the passes. Myrcella’s dragon flies over the mountains to slay the elephants of Trystane. By using the goat tracks, the Young Dragon “flew over” the mountains and caught the Dornish unawares.

Dragons win.

**Round 3**

&gt;Quentyn heard the sellswords shouting. Caggo was calling for the chains, and Pretty Meris was screaming at someone to step aside. The dragon moved awkwardly on the ground, like a man scrabbling on his knees and elbows, but quicker than the Dornish prince would have believed. When the Windblown were too late to get out of his way, Viserion let loose with another roar. Quentyn heard the rattle of chains, the deep *thrum* of a crossbow.  
&gt;  
&gt;“No,” he screamed, “no, don’t, *don’t*,” but it was too late. *The fool* was all that he had time to think as the quarrel caromed off Viserion’s neck to vanish in the gloom. A line of fire gleamed in its wake—dragon’s blood, glowing gold and red.  
&gt;  
&gt;Quentyn turned and threw his left arm across his face to shield his eyes from the furnace wind. *Rhaegal*, he reminded himself, *the green one is Rhaegal*.  
&gt;  
&gt;When he raised his whip, he saw that the lash was burning. His hand as well. All of him, all of him was burning.

This is a full representation of the conquest of Dorne. Prince Quentyn was engaged with Viserion and he was standing at the only way in or out. This is *literally* the Prince’s Pass. However, Quentyn could not notice Rhaegal creeping behind and burning him. This is similar to how the Young Dragon used the goat tracks and caught the Dornish unawares.

Dragons win.

**Round 4**

Trystane loses the cyvasse game to a clever Lannister to whom he is betrothed. It is foreshadowed that Viserion will be Tyrion’s mount but he will lose it at one point, after which he might claim Rhaegal. Quentyn was intending to steal Viserion, which will be the mount of another clever Lannister (Tyrion) but he was slain by Rhaegal. With the green dragon, Tyrion will fly through the Red Mountains to find the goat tracks. While Dany’s main naval force attacks Planky Town, her other armies will invade Dorne by these goat tracks. Note that the elephants of Trystane are eaten by Myrcella’s dragon flying over the mountains. The elephants allude to the Golden Company and Tyrion will be one of the instrumental pieces in defeating them.

Dragons will win this round and the Dornish will pay the price of Arianne’s royal ambitions.",asoiaf
"We *know* King’s Landing is going to burn at her hands, but there are so many layers to it that I’m not too sure of yet. Questions to think about are: 

- Is Tyrion going to have a role in her decision to burn King’s Landing? Will she be influenced by his hate for everyone there? 
- Will she burn civilians before or after they’ve surrendered? It seems like an oddly specific detail to include in the show, but I really don’t think she has been developed enough in the books to do this after they’ve surrendered. 
- How much of King’s Landing do you think she is going to burn? Perhaps fAegon will hide in the crowd of innocents? 
- Do you think the wildfire will have anything to do with it? As in, will the wildfire caches set off and cause a lot more collateral damage, making her *look* at fault? 
-  Will she burn Meereen in the books? Will those at Volantis convince her that she must “purify non believers” and let the Lord of Light deal with their problems? 
- Will Dany be monstrous enough by the time she gets to Westeros? Will she *want* to burn King’s Landing or will it be something she is conflicted on?",asoiaf
"First thing I have to say is that I have been watching this show for a long time. I picked up the books shortly after the season 2 ended, and I read through all of them. Even in seasons 3 or 4, which are generally regarded as the golden age of the show, I noticed my favourite characters drift away from their book counterparts. 

However I **do not** consider this in itself to be a problem. After all, the show is different, and there is nothing bad about minor or even major changes, as long as you make a sense of it in the end. 


When you derive from the story of characters book counterpart, while still wanting both of them to end up at the same place, that’s where the issues start. I’ve decided to create this “masterpost,” about where I think the show went wrong with each main character (Sansa, Petyr, Arya, Jon, Tyrion, Jaime, Cersei, Daenerys and Bran) and why it became such a spectacular failure. 


Let’s begin with one of my favourite characters, Sansa, since she is the most perfect example.



#**Sansa Stark**

When Sansa arrived to the Vale with Petyr, she is finally free from Joffrey’s tyrrany. She is free to grow, and to become her own person. In the books, she learns that it was Petyr who started the war with his actions. She sees the whole truth, and decides to stay with him anyway. What other choice does she have? She takes her first step to become a competent player in the game of thrones when she lies about her aunt’s death, and from then forward, she learns. We can only assume that she will become a cunning and capable person, who outwits Littlefinger in the end, and takes power into her own hands. 


And what happened in the show? When she escaped King’s Landing, where she was used and abused, waiting for someone to save her, they decided to merge her story with Jayne Poole, and marry her to Ramsay. There, she once again, is used and abused, waiting for someone to save her. Throwing a character into the same situation over and over again is not a way to make them grow. When she finally escapes, suddenly she is a cunning and calculating individual. Where did that come from? Honestly as much as I don’t like seeing all the Sansa hate, I don’t really blame you all. She suddenly emerged a genius manipulator without ever doing anything that would indicate her new set fo skills. When she outsmarted Petyr, it was not her wit, it was Bran telling her what he has done. Was that supposed to be Sansa’s victory? That brings me to...



#**Petyr Baelish**

The moment Bran quoted his own words back to him, Petyr would’ve fled Winterfell immediately. That’s all there is to this point. His whole character arc from seasons 4 to 7 is him getting dumber and dumber so Sansa can seem smarter in comparison. This is not a development, this is laziness. His whole plot of pitting Arya and Sansa against each other was just stupid. Speaking of...



#**Arya Stark**

Arya Stark was a a deeply traumatised individual suffering from PTSD who chose to kill the people who have wronged her as an unhealthy coping mechanism. Her character let us see the horrors of war and the world they live in. She is a very morally grey character, or at least that was, untill the show started glorifying her actions. 


Suddenly, all the mental consequences of mercilessly killing another human disaapeared, and Arya was reduced to a badass stereotype, and a tool to make people in bars cheer loudly. 

*”Oh yes, the audience hates Freys, and they love Arya. Let’s have her murder them all with a badass speech and no consequences, murder is cool! Oh, Meryn Trant?  He’s on Arya’s list, but I don’t know if people hate him enough, let’s suddenly make him a pedophile!* 

As this show progresses, we see that most characters stop being morally complex, and could easily fall into a good vs. bad guy cathegory. It doesn’t matter what they have done, when they’re a fan favourite, they can do no wrong. Just as...



#**Jon Snow**

When Jon becomes Lord Commander, he starts suffering from a serious case of whitewashing. His position requires him to make hard choices, as any leading position in Westeros does. So let me bring you up to speed - In the books, Mance Ryder had a son. Since Melissandre is currently on The Wall, Jon fears that she would want to use the said son in a ritual, and burn him alive since he has king’s blood. To prevent this, he switches Gilly’s baby with Mance’s son in secret, and commands Sam and Gilly to go to The Citadel. 


It’s a clear case of a hard, morally questionable choice. He may be saving a life of an innocent baby, but in the process he has to separate a mother from her child, and leave Little Sam at The Wall, putting him in danger. The show decided to not include any of this, because as I said, the “good guys” can do no wrong. This amongst other things is the reason why Jon and others feel less and less like characters in the later seasons, and more like a bunch of plot devices just designed to go from one place to another. But he is far from the worst victims of this whitewashing phenomenon...



#**Tyrion Lannister**

Oh, the Tysha confession. You must’ve heard about it a thousand times, so I’ll keep it short. When Tyrion escapes the black cell with Jaime’s help, his brother confesses that Tyrion’s first wife, Tysha, wasn’t a whore paid by Jaime at all. Their father just made Jaime lie. She was a normal girl who fell in love with Tyrion. That’s why he went and killed Tywin. When he asked him where Tysha is, Tywin answered with a simple *”wherever whores go.”* They were supposed to be talking about Tysha, not Shae.


*(By the way, it makes no sense to shoot your father for saying that an actual whore, who you yourself called a whore, is in fact a whore. Didn’t really work with Shae, just saying.)*


Not only they made Tyrion’s murder of Shae into a self defense, because the audience likes Tyrion, therefore he just *can not* kill a defenseless woman, by skipping the Tysha confession, they basically rendered Tyrion useless for the rest of the show. After Jaime told him, he swore revenge against him and their sister. They did not part on good terms in the slightest, and then Tyrion spiralls into a pit of depression and hatered for his family, himself, and the whole world. If he still cared about Jaime, why would he bring Daenerys to Westeros, if he knew that his brother is on the other side, and that he’s the kind of guy who’s capable of charging at a dragon? He wouldn’t.  (To be clear, I’m not saying that book!Tyrion doesn’t care about Jaime, he obviously still does, but after he escapes, he’s blinded by rage and thirst for revenge, so he would be capable of that.)


If they truly wished for Jaime and Tyrion to remain on good terms, I’m okay with that. As I said in the beginning, there is nothing wrong with straying from the source material, as long as it makes sense at the end. I would be okay with the show replacing Tyrion’s depressive period with some another way to develop his character. The problem is that they replaced it with nothing. From the end of season 4 to the moment he decides he no longer wishes to be Dany’s Hand at the end of season 8, there is absolutely no character progression and development for him. He stayes the same. I guess they tried to do the whole “Dany made Tyrion believe in the world again” when she named him her Hand, but just as I said with Sansa’s intellingence, there has to be a setup for a payoff to work. No Tysha confession, no setup. But Tyrion wasn’t the only character hurt by skipping this detail, which brings me to...



#**Jaime Lannister**

When Jaime confesses, Tyrion, in his rage, informs Jaime that Cersei has been unfaithful to him, with multiple people. And since then, just as Tyrion can’t stop wondering *where do the whores go,* Jaime can’t stop thinking about his sisters infidelity. It’s the first stepping stone to Jaime leaving her at the end of AFFC. Now I’m not saying that Jaime isn’t coming back to Cersei in the books. I’m not saying he is. Either way his “redemption” and moral decision goes, I’ll just be happy as long as he continues to be as well written as he is now. 


But in the show, him not learning about Cersei fucking the Moon Boy for all I know caused that he stayed with her for too long. His whole character arc in the show would’ve been ok, if he decided to leave around season 6, spent season 7 finding out who he is without her and exploring his relationship with Brienne, and then decided to come back to his sister just before they both die. It was incredibly rushed, and I’m sorry, but shagging Brienne and leaving seven minutes later, with only contemplating present being Nikolaj dramatically staring in the distance with pained expression for five seconds, is not a proper way to handle characters decisions, especially not the life changing ones.


But the problem with Jaime in the show is rooted far deeper, in his characterisation itself and fandom’s perception of him. And I don’t really know if I can fault the show for that. Well, for an extent, I certainly can. In the books, most of who Jaime is isn’t revealed through his actions, but in a way he thinks. Often it happens when he says one thing, while thinking the complete opposite, which is why I have certain sympathies towards showrunners trying to bring his characters to a TV screen. It must be very hard to convey him in proper manner. That’s why he was mostly reduced to “a bad guy that’s secretly a good guy,” then throwing in a few show original out of character unforgivables (otherwise known as *The Cousins Fate* and *Accidental Not-Rape*) without realising that the audience is not here to forgive Jaime, not here to watch his “redemption arc,” because there is none. Morally gray doesn’t mean a person being bad at first and then good, or vice versa. It’s not black and white, it’s just gray. 


It is natural that when you’re adapting a story, a lot of characters dialogues doesn’t make it to the TV screen. But I think that since it’s very hard to show Jaime as he is to the audience, (obviously you can’t have Nikolaj say what Jaime is thinking out loud,) the show should’ve let more of his dialogues through. I feel it could’ve helped in his portrayal. 


*(Also, I know I said I wasn’t going to talk about the later seasons, but I can’t contain myself on this one, so I just gotta say: Euron Greyjoy suddenly emerging from the depths and proceeding to fight Jaime for no reason was the most ridiculous shit I’ve seen in a long time. It was so absurd, I couldn’t stop laughing the whole scene. Yes, I laughed when Jaime, my absolute favourite character not only in ASOIAF but probably in all of literature, was getting stabbed to death. Him running around briskly for the rest of the episode with three fatal stab wounds was just a cherry on top. What a great scene.)*



#**Cersei Lannister**

Book!Cersei and show!Cersei are very different people, and I don’t mind that in the slightest. Mostly, Cersei in the show suffers from the lack of consequences, and the lack of insight about her rule. The consequences I’m talking about aren’t from the other houses - they did the best they could do, supported Daenerys. But from the smallfolk. The queen they loved, Maergery, is suddenly dead. Before Cersei siezed Highgarden, there was probably not enough food in the city, since the alliance with Tyrells burned down in flames, literally. The war is expensive - building so many ballistas, The Golden Company, was there enough money to feed the people of the city? We don’t know. Why should we root for Daenerys to rule Westeros (beside the fact that she’s our favourite character,) why should we be convinced that she’ll be a better ruler than Cersei, when we have no idea about what kind of ruler Cersei is? Since there were not revolts, should we assume that she’s a good one? Or that she’s a bad one because Dany says so?

There is also a problem with the *valonqar* prophecy, that had no place being in the show, since book!Cersei and show!Cersei are fundementally different people. The prophecy is book!Cersei’s main drive, but show!Cersei’s drive are her children. Book!Cersei does everything she can to prevent the prophecy from coming true, fulfilling it in the process, because her true fear is her own demise, not her childrens. If the same could be applied to show!Cersei, since the part about her own demise was skipped, she’s only doing everything she can so that her children stay alive, for the sake of her children. Which is something every mother in her situation would do, with or without a prophecy, especially when her children serve important positions as Kings, who are constantly in danger. So as opposed to in the books, it served no purpose.



#**Daenerys Targaryen**

Dany and Jaime have a similar problem in the show, but with Dany it could be easily solvable. In the books, Dany chooses to try at diplomacy while she rules in Mereen. During that, she is constantly conflicted between doing what she thinks is right, and her inner conqueror, the blood of the dragon. After she escapes Mereen and is stranded by Drogon, just before she is found by the khalasaar, she realizes that her rule in Mereen was a failure, and (with a little help from a Quaithe vision) realizes that to win the iron throne, she must embrace the fire and blood. In the show, this realization never comes, and instead of gradually building Dany up to do something horrible (burning the King’s Landing, for example,) she goes from 0 to a 100. Yes, there was foreshadowing in the show. But just as The Red Wedding was foreshadowed (in Dany’s vision, for example,) it is not enough. Characters have to do stuff to get there. 


Yes, Daenerys made a lot of questionable decisions. Crucifying the masters, for example. The important distinction is that she did *what she thought was right in the moment.* When she burned down King’s Landing, she wasn’t doing what is right, she did what she thought was *necessary* for her to rule the seven kingdoms. She was willing to do a horrible thing to get to her goal, and that’s the important difference. That’s the point her character needed to get to, and in the show, it just didn’t. 



#**Bran Stark**


*”I have watched you, with a thousand eyes and one,” said the Three Eyed Crow, referencing a song about himself, a skinchanger and greenseer with one eye, while played by an actor with two eyes.*


Sorry, I just had to. It made me laugh a little when he said it, why even reference it when you decide to never mention Bloodraven’s identity again. Brynden Rivers is one of my favourite characters, you can’t fault me for being a bit salty. 

Anyway, Bran. This goes mainly to the marketing team - You can’t market your show with slogans like “Who wins the throne?” and presenting the throne as a reward, while simultaneously trying to convey a message that sitting on the throne is not a reward. I know Bran as a king is from GRRMs head (as is “Mad Queen Dany” probably,) but maybe don’t make the character who sits on the throne in the end dissapear for a whole season. 

His time in Bloodraven’s cave was a perfect opportunity to find out about how his powers work, what can he do, the Other’s motivations, or maybe some time for Bran to finally show what kind of person he is other than a person who “has to find a three eyed raven,” which is all he was in the show for most of the time. Make him do something. Make him make a proper difference by using his powers. We got the the point where the only reasonable explanation is my boy Brynden luring Bran into his cave just to warg him and rule the kingdoms himself, after concluding that all the available Targs are useless, while fAegon got lost at sea. 


Well, that’s all of them, so I’m done for now. Thank you all for reading.

"If Jaime had told Ned how he saved KL from the wildfire plot of Aerys when Ned found him sitting on the Throne ? Any takers ? I think Ned would have been impressed by his courage . What say you ?


A Storm of Swords - Jaime V
""If this is true, how is it no one knows?""
""The knights of the Kingsguard are sworn to keep the king's secrets. Would you have me break my oath?"" Jaime laughed. ""Do you think the noble Lord of Winterfell wanted to hear my feeble explanations? Such an honorable man. He only had to look at me to judge me guilty."" Jaime lurched to his feet, the water running cold down his chest. ""By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?"" A violent shiver took him, and he smashed his stump against the rim of the tub as he tried to climb out.
Pain shuddered through him . . . and suddenly the bathhouse was spinning. Brienne caught him before he could fall. Her arm was all gooseflesh, clammy and chilled, but she was strong, and gentler than he would have thought. Gentler than Cersei, he thought as she helped him from the tub, his legs wobbly as a limp cock. ""Guards!"" he heard the wench shout. ""The Kingslayer!""",asoiaf
"I'm currently at  halfway through ASOS and Jon is such a better character compared to the show. Not only that he has more tasks and interactions with characters but he's more compelling and expressive despite the fact that he's younger compared to the show. 


They really reduced Ghost's role on the show and that I think it was mistake and a damnshame, especially because of his relationship with Jon and the fact that he's a warg just like Bran. But in the show Jon was separated from Ghost for a season and a half. Not that it damaged their relationship since Direwolves are loyal and loving but it's very nice to see that in the books they are always together, even after Jon *joined* the Wildlings.


Jon still had his major talk with Sam in AGOT but it was again changed while adding other aspects on the tv show, as well his farewell from Ned that was show exclusive, and what was the reason why he *joined* the Wildlings that was about to be revealed to Mance Rayder.


Speaking of Mance, he also has a more active and interesting role, same with Qhorin Halfhand. When Mance revealed that he infiltrated at Winterfell to see Robert I was as shocked as Jon. And Ygritte's traits seem to be a bit different so far, bummer they cut off the part about the song on the show.

Jon Snow is my favorite character of the tv show and I love Kit Harington performance but I'm afraid I will like his book counterpart more by the end of ADWD.",asoiaf
"I am currently doing a re-read of ASOIAF and hit upon an interesting allusion to Greek mythology in Davos II DwD.  I’m sure others have already spotted it but it just hit me hard and so I wanted to put it out there in case others, like me, have yet to spot it.   

At the start of the chapter Davos arrives at White Harbor on the ship Merry Midwife.  The reader is given a detailed description of this cog, down to her figurehead – a laughing woman holding an infant by one foot.  I thought it was a really unique image for a ship’s figurehead.  It hit me that what this figurehead was depicting was the Greek myth of baby Achilles being dipped into the river Styx by his mother.  She held him by the heel as she dipped baby Achilles in the water.  But why make such an unmistakable reference to Achilles?  I began to pull that thread…

In Greek mythology, Achilles spent his childhood in hiding on the isle of Skyros.  Odysseus goes to find Achilles in order to successfully capture Troy.  He goes to Skyros and manages to get Achilles to reveal himself.  

This all sounds so much like what Davos is about to do at the end of his story in DwD.  Davos is so much like Odysseus it’s funny I didn’t think about it years before.  He spends years serving his king while the whole time pining for home and his wife (think Odysseus in the Odyssey wanting nothing but to complete his tasks in order to return home to his wife).  Davos is sailing around islands, being bombarded by storms, and finding himself at the mercy of various lords.  Again, this sounds so much like Odysseus in the Odyssey.  Then there is, of course, the mission to find Rickon.  The isle of SKAGOS sound an awful like the isle of SKYROS.  Davos is sent to find a boy in hiding as Odysseus was sent to find a boy in hiding.  

The flavor of this Greek story is all over Davos in DwD.  I can only guess how it will play out in TWoW but I’m now confident that looking towards stories of the Iliad and the Odyssey may provide predictive hints.

EDITED the name of ship.  My mistake, it was not the Merry Maid but rather the Merry Midwife.",asoiaf
"The following quote is from his farewell letter of TWD comic issue #193:

"A couple of months ago u/glass_table_girl posted a marvelous essay called “Daughter of Death: A Song of Ice and Fire’s Shakespearean tragic hero” I highly recommend people check it out. It got me wondering about the Daenerys, Jon and Tyrion’s fates as Shakespearean figures, considering how the show ended. I personally can’t picture Daenerys burning KL in the way the show did it, mercilessly targeting small folk AFTER the city surrendered. This seems like the show choosing the most shocking and objectively evil way possible, so as to get the audience fully onboard with Jon killing her. I think it more likely that Daenerys decides to attack (f)Aegon and KL with Dragonfire and unwittingly detonates the wildfire caches. As Steven Attewell has said this would make her “still morally culpable but not objectively monstrous”. Other POV characters (not knowing wildfire was involved) could then conclude that Daenerys had been entirely responsible and burned the city, totally on her own. Her own fateful choice to give in to her darkest impulses and attack (f)Aegon with her Dragons will have then cemented everyone’s worst fears about her. 

I can see Tyrion, being blamed by Daenerys for not revealing to her the truth about the Wildfire, and being imprisoned. When Jon meets with him, Tyrion, who has already become jealous of Jon for earning Daenerys’ affections, and wanting revenge on the both of them, plays the role of Iago to Jon’s Othello in a way. Rather than persuading Jon that Daenerys is cheating on him, Tyrion convinces him that Daenerys represents a mortal threat to his family, as he does in the show, but unlike the show, does so in an intentionally deceitful manner. We know from ADWD, that if Jon is convinced that Arya is in danger he will not scruple to break an oath. George originally intended Tyrion and Jon to be involved in a fateful love triangle with Arya, perhaps now he’s substituted Dany for Arya as the object of their (hopeless in Tyrion’s case) affections. Daenerys burning KL will have cemented the possibility in Jon’s mind that she really could be a threat to his family. 

I think Jon and Daenerys would have become estranged prior to this point anyway. I don’t think it will be Jon’s discomfort with incest ( remember he was originally supposed to have a thing for his sister/cousin) that causes it but rather Daenerys’ mistrust of him upon learning his identity. Which Tyrion will also exploit, as he does in the show. As the “Daughter of Death” essay outlines, this can be yet another fateful choice that Daenerys has made. Choosing to distance herself from Jon, of rejecting the love and companionship that was her hearts desire, because of her fear of betrayal. She could think “how long did he know?” “Was he lying to me the entire time?” “Did I kill my brothers son, thinking him false and fall in love with an imposter?” This would also add a level of moral complexity and “grayness” to Jon’s decision. He’s got his own reasons to feel hurt and wronged by Daenerys, which may be driving his choices. I can’t picture George writing a scene where a man murders a woman who he’s intimate with and playing it as “you should feel sorry for the man, he clearly had no choice.” Especially since he already did this with Victarion and doesn’t seem to think it’s that admirable (because it isn’t). We should understand Jon’s motivation but the morality of his decision will be much more gray in George’s version. 

Tyrion’s ultimate fate will echo Iago’s in a way. “Demand me nothing. What you know, you know./From this time forth I never will speak word.” Like Iago, he survives the story but is no longer trusted to give poisonous counsel to others. Unlike Iago though, Tyrion is LITERALLY silenced, and made into a mute. There’s been plenty of theorizing in the fan community about Tyrion losing his tongue or ability to speak. I think there’s been plenty of foreshadowing for this as well. I know this proposed version basically leaves Tyrion as a villain (albeit a sympathetic one IMO) which people won’t like. The show clearly decided to cast Tyrion as a saintly figure, which weakened him as a character tremendously. I think this fits George’s story better than what we got in the show. The only real problem I can see with the Tyrion as Iago concept, as it relates to Jon, is that he has already played this role for Jaime. “She’s been fucking Lancel, and Osmund Kettleblack and Moonboy for all I know.” 

What do you think? I’m not a Shakespeare scholar so please have mercy in your criticisms on that score.

"I think most were disappointed that in the show the White Walkers only made it to Winterfell before being defeated. 8 seasons of build-up and they have almost no impact on the plot. Makes no sense, since they are introduced in the prologue of *AGoT* and the cold opening of the series premiere, showing that this is the real important plot, not the political scheming. My question is, do you think the books will go down the same route of having the Others defeated at Winterfell? Or do you think they'll make it further down south, leading to more of Westeros uniting together? I think that'll likely happen, here's hoping.",asoiaf
"Never make a TV show based on a series of books until the source material is complete.

[EDIT] GRRM right now has almost no incentive to finish his series. He has many other projects that he is working on that will pay as much as or more than the future profit from TWOW or ADOS. GRRM has his GoT money, and I doubt he will finish ASOIAF within 5-10 years, or without seeking extra help. Imagine if HBO set up a contract with Martin that they would make a long running TV series out of IF he completed the source material first. We might actually have the full series out by now.

"Based on “the slayer of lies” prophecy and “the blue eyed king with no shadow” vision from HotU sequence, many readers have long predicted a confrontation between Dany and Stannis. One of the oldest theories for this confrontation came not long after ADwD was published. According to that theory, Stannis will eventually win the Manderlys to his cause. When Dany comes to Westeros, Stannis will use the newly introduced Manderly fleet against Dany and this naval battle will end with Dany’s victory, hence fulfilling the HotU vision.

Another theory that was fed into this scheme was that Tyrion will be the rider of Viserion and in this naval battle against Stannis, Davos will fire a bolt that will slay Viserion. I don’t want to get into the discussion about why Tyrion will be Viserion’s rider but the death of Viserion was guessed by the following quotes:

&gt;“Well, how *long* does a dragon live?” She looked up as Viserion swooped low over the ship, his wings beating slowly and stirring the limp sails.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt; He moved the catapult again, closed his hand around Tyrion's alabaster dragon, removed it from the board. 

When Dany asks the life expectancy of dragons, GRRM drops Viserion to the scene as he flies low over the ship. This means Viserion might be the first dragon to die. Also noting the ship and sails detail from the quote and recalling that the sigil of Davos has a ship in it with an onion on its sails, it might suggest that Davos will be the one to slay Viserion. This might happen in the above mentioned naval battle between Dany and Stannis and it will also be the second round of Davos vs. Tyrion. At the Blackwater, Davos lost his sons to Tyrion’s wildfire. In the second round, Davos might take down Tyrion’s mount as payback.

Note that this was a very early theory when even [Davos the Dragonslayer](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Davos_the_Dragonslayer) was not created by GRRM yet, nor did we have the excerpts from the Dance of Dragons. At that time, it was like blasphemy to suggest the death of any dragons. But after GRRM revealed how dragons were slain like flies during the Dance of Dragons, how he also revealed a legendary hero named Davos the Dragonslayer in TWOIAF and how Viserion was slain in the show, I became even more convinced on this theory and I included in all versions of my outline.

This sums up the naval battle between Dany and Stannis, the dragonslaying moment of Davos and Dany’s victory at the expense of Viserion. My addition to this theory when I incorporated it into my outline was that after the victory, Dany will be furious for the loss of Viserion and she will want to send a message to Westeros to let them see what happens if they fight against Dany. She will fly Drogon to White Harbor after the victory and burn down parts of the city as punishment until she cools off. This idea of mine about Dany burning White Harbor after the death of Viserion was brutally rejected like the rest of my outlines.

More than 2 years passed and we watched Dany firebombing King’s Landing after the battle is won and massacring innocents. Since then, people hated this idea of Dany indiscriminately massacring innocents after the battle is over, called it bad writing and proposed many changes to “improve” the scenario. One of the widely proposed ideas was to make sure that Rhaegal is slain by the defenders at the capitol and that should have made Dany snap and burn innocents. Well, you can imagine my reaction to /r/asoiaf clinging on to an idea of a “Dany-hater” like me and thinking that it makes sense.

Finally, I want to share some objections to Dany burning White Harbor for the death of Viserion by my good friend  [**u/YezenIRL**](https://www.reddit.com/user/YezenIRL/) as we discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/7678of/spoilers_extended_twow_outline_with_chapter/dofmquc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).",asoiaf
"So, it's explained that after Jon Arryn called his banners and rebelled against King Aerys, Robert went to the Stormlands, and Ned went to the North respectively to call their banners and get reinforcements. I'm wondering what the North's opinion of Ned was at the time, since Ned was apparently unlike Brandon in most ways; Brandon was hot-blooded and eager to fight, and Ned was The Quiet Wolf and was fostered in the Vale.

Did Ned's upbringing help or hinder his efforts to call the banners, or were any misgivings about Eddard 'All about that Honor"" Stark overshadowed by unyielding rage since Rickard, Brandon, and Brandon's host were murdered in horrible ways and that the people of the North hold one Hell of a grudge?",asoiaf

However, there is one more reading order which gets mentioned a lot, A Feast with Dragons, and I found surprisingly little information about it. Which is a shame because I really enjoy the art that combining Books 4 and 5 is and this reading order does many interesting things, from the way it opens, the spacing of Davos and Daenerys to the ending and probably many more things I didn't notice.

"In lamenting some of the terribleness of modern screenwriting, Blake Snyder points out how many films lack a simple ""Save the cat!"" scene which he defines as such:

&gt;It's the scene where we meet the hero and the hero *does* something -- like saving a cat -- that defines who he is and makes us, the audience, like him.

Before continuing, there's a few caveats to stave off some knee-jerk criticisms of this description (it's overly simple). It doesn't need to be the ""hero,"" just whoever the story wants us to invest in. It doesn't have to be something cliche and saccharine like literally saving a cat. And, we don't actually need to ""like"" the character; don't need to identity with or relate to them. What we need to do is care about what he does and what happens to him.

All that said, one part of the save the cat description that is a hard and fast rule is that the character must *do* something. The italics are Snyder's original, and it's just an immutable law of story telling that active characters are more engaging than passive ones. When something horrible happens to a character *we're already invested in*, we care. We don't care when a character is introduced as a victim, having something horrible happening to them.

In the series Stranger Things, this is the ""he could have cast protection, but instead he cast fireball"" moment when Mike, Lucas, and Dustin decide to defy their curfews, and put themselves in danger (either with their parents, or something worse) in order to go looking for their missing friend.

Doesn't have to be something heroic though. It could simply be a character doing something clever. In Arrival, it's the ""desire for more cows"" moment. It's the opening monologue of Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Or it could be something horrible. It's *killing* the dog in House of Cards (boy do we already hate you, Frank Underwood, but we're also already invested in your story).

**Everywhere They Hurt Little Cats**

So where does this leave us with A Game of Thrones?

Ned certainly doesn't save any cats... though they do save some direwolf pups. But actually, Ned's save the cat scene is executing Gared. I hate the ""subverting expectations"" crutch as much as the next guy (unless the next guy is a popcorn-stuffer who loves subverted expectations), but the save the cat moment for Ned is him killing a deserter who the audience knows had damn good reason to run as far and as fast from the Wall as he could. It works though because we're able to understand Ned's point of view and are impressed with his ""the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword"" attitude and the vulnerability he shows when telling Bran that the only time a man can be brave is when he's scared. Maybe we think Gared deserved a chance to return to Castle Black (maybe not), but either way Ned has done a thing that expresses his character and makes us care about what happens to him.

**But What About All The Other Cats That Need Saving?**

What complicates the hell out of this mechanic is that ASOIAF has so many damn characters in the driver's seat. We're expected to get invested in a lot of people in this series -- that's a lot of cats that need saving. I obviously can't get into all of them, but I've just picked out three more that I think are particularly interesting.

**Tyrion** -- If you're thinking it's the ""bastards, cripples, and broken things"" moment when Tyrion returns to Winterfell after visiting the Wall, you're too late. If you think it's Tyrion being the first to tell Jon the truth about the Night's Watch on their way to the Wall, you're again too late. I believe Tyrion's first save the cat moment is when he bitch slaps Prince Joffrey. We've already been introduced to Tyrion in Jon's first chapter, and he's probably gotten our interest with the ""all dwarves are bastards in the eyes of their fathers"" quip. But, it's when Tyrion, the stunted man with feeble twisted legs, slaps the crown prince right in front of The Hound that he really gets his moment of showing his character -- like his brother the Kingslayer, the Imp strives to be someone better than what the world believes him to be.

**Sansa** -- I think this one is rather complicated. If I said I cared what happened to Sansa in AGOT, it's only to the extent that I really care about what happens to Joffrey. Truth be told, Sansa is something of an antagonist in the first book. When we start to get more invested in her is in A Clash of Kings. Early on, we get the pathetic excuse of a tournament for Joffrey's name day celebration where Sansa does an almost literal saving a cat by saving Ser Dontos. This is the moment where we see the Sansa we'll come to appreciate, someone who is not only less of a brat (because of the trauma she suffered in AGOT) but also becoming a savvy manipulator. This isn't the the Sansa who got upset that Ned bought her a doll or who betrayed her sister to save her relationship with Joffrey, but the Sansa who says she ""prays for an end to the fighting"" without saying how she prays it ends. That's the Sansa we get invested in.

**Danaerys** -- This is probably the trickiest of the characters. If she had been successfully assassinated by the wine merchant, I think my reaction would have been ""oh shit... what does this mean for Ned?"" I had a hard time getting invested in her character, and I believe this is because for much of her story things are happening *to* her. It's true that along the way in AGOT she gains more and more autonomy. Perhaps her save the cat moment is when she orders the Dothraki to stop raping the Lahrazeen women. This is going to be highly subjective, of course. What makes one reader invested doesn't necessarily click for another. A second potential moment for investment in her is of course Khal Drogo's funeral, the burning of MMD, and the birth of her dragons -- for me though she's only semi-active there, having an idea of what she's doing, but not fully aware. For me, it feels like she's in a bit of a haze, and not yet come into her own.

The moment where Danaerys saved the cat for me was her decision to leave Vaes Tolorro. She has traveled long and hard through the Red Wastes and finally found a place of relative safety. The region has water, fruit trees, and arable land. She could remain there, perhaps her small khalasar would grow a little, and more importantly her dragons could mature in safety. With the lamb women, I don't believe she really understood what she was doing in saving them. With the funeral pyre, she's acting half out of grief. But, in leaving Vaes Tolorro, she is in a position of relative safety, and most importantly -- she is able to exercise complete agency.

tl;dr: If an author wants someone to get invested in their characters, they need to do something to earn the audience's investment. We're not just drawn to people because someone tells us we're supposed to be.

"Daenerys will burn King's Landing. It is know. Is a event that has a lot of chances to happen in the books. 

However, a sector of the fandom created a theory that such a tragedy would be...a accident caused for Dany's recklessness and lack of knowledge about the Wildfire rather than a conscious choice. 

I dislike that theory, strongly. 

The arguments used for it is that Dany wouldn't be able to kill so many innocents, but this is the same girl that sacrificed a woman that just got revenge on the warlord that killed her town and whose men raped her and her loved ones. The girl that ends Dance by embracing Fire and Blood and is tempted for it. 

Dany will burn King's landing and it would be a totally her choice. Likely a choice that she would regret right after the fact, but it would be HER choice. Honestly, I theorize that the show events will happen and that losing her loved ones, especially stuff as Missandei being executed, which would make a Daenerys that is already willing to use violence go even further. 

Danerys will burn all those people, she might even know about the Wildfire catches and don't care, but ultimately, Daenerys Targaryen would be willing to burn thousands. 

But, why Daenerys killing so many civilians SHOULD NOT be a accident? What if the point of the story is that Dany was always a well meaning heroine that is seen as a new Mad King for the --fundies-- I mean, Westerosi Lords?

Well, I will be blunt, that's lame. 

Daenerys killing thousands serves a purpose in the narrative. Is the moment where she being so distant from all other characters serves a purpose. We saw Dany being a heroine that takes down slavery and tries her best to free people.

But Daenerys' invasion of Westeros is a invasion. Is a foreign army coming to attack a land that is under the biggest crisis of their generation to put the daughter of a dynasty that fell due to their own stupidity and cruelty.  

Daenerys' burning of Westeros is the moment where you have to sit down and think ""Holy Shit, this little girl become the new Maegor the Cruel?"". Makes even more sense when you think in the Five Years Gap, where Daenerys would look even more like a fantasy evil queen. 

Not that Dany would lose all redeeming traits, she would have done her best in Essos, she would have fought against the Others and their Long Night and nevernding winter. Dany would be a heroine. But remember this quote and apply it to Daenerys. 
 
&gt;A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. You were a hero and a smuggler.”

Daenerys would be a heroine in Essos, but in Westeros, she would be the fearsome Daenerys The Cruel, the worst threat that the Seven Kingdom have faced, the biggest single mass murderer of her generation. 

Also, a corolary. What about Jon?

Jon will kill Dany, the Ship Tease (...ship, Har!) between the two is strong in both book and show, being outright canonical in the later. However, the ending of the couple in the show was pretty grim, Jon killing Daenerys, thus stopping the Stallion That Mounts The World and her burning crusade. 

Now, I agree with /u/YezenIRL and his that Book!Jon will do it not due to a purely altruist desire, but rather doing it thinking mostly or uniquely on his family. (Also, I expect that Jon's story  would become a myth that would make ""him"" a new Azor Ahai-like figure, a Altruist Hero that killer her Beloved, moved for his Honor to save the world. Bonus point if Dany also embraces a Azor Ahai role after meeting Red Priests. Oh the Irony would be big). But this is the think, Jon's story ends with him killing someone that he loves and suffering emotionally for it. 

If Daenerys' killed so many people as a accident...Jon comes off as a idiot that don't listen the truth. 

Add Cersei too. I expect her to be killed in Dany's rampage, she wouldn't be Queen when that happens, but she might try to escape during the burning of King's Landing. Add Jon Con who I also expect to die during the Burning.

Daenerys killing King's Landing as a accident don't creates a tragedy. It makes everyone look like unlucky idiots.",asoiaf

"The first clue is in the name. The Ty-part is given to most Lannister sons, but not to Jaime. Martin has said to give name’s a lot of thought. This could be to allude that Tyrion is the real son of Tywin.

The second clue is the incest between Jaimie and Cersei. This was of course a tradition in the Targaryen family. 

The third is ‘the waking if the dragon’ both Jaime and Cersei spend times in captivity and both seem to be fundamentally changed by this experience. The same happened to Aerys. Tyrion on the other hand doesn’t really seem changed after his experience in the sky cell.

Fourth is the constant mention of threes throughout Jamie’s, but especially Cersei’s story. Three children, Three septa’s, Three questions for Maggy the frog and so on. Tyrion at one point says that Cersei is ‘As gente as king Maegor, as selfless as Aegon the Unworthy, as wise as Mad Aerys.’ These are three Targaryen kings. Why specifically these Targaryen kings when he could have said for example ‘As strong as Tytos or as empathetic as Tywin.’

This all combined with her love for wildfire, Aerys obvious interest in Joanna and the deformed child being born out of incest. Also the fact that Genna Lannister says that Tyrion is the real son of Tywin.

"Might be denial and delusions, but I'd be willing to bet we're gonna see a very different ending on the books. We won't only get different HOWs but a different WHAT. I started thinking about it since 8x04 confirmed the WW threat was completely gone, then GRRM wrote in his blog: **""The same ending as the show?  Different? Well… yes.  And no.  And yes.   And no.   And yes.   And no.   And yes.""**

So is it different? first answer is yes, then he's basically saying some things might be similar, but not really, but some things do happen, but different. So if you ask me, yeah, it's gonna be completely different.


**How do we even know D&amp;D chose to use GRRM's ending?** Think about it, would they change so much of the characters and plots, **stop working with George and continuously defy the books just to go and use the intended ending for the story? I think not**, I hope not. I honestly believe the show's ending (Mad Queen Dany and King Bran the Broken), just like the NK's death by Arya, are all D&amp;D.


They even get angry if an actor tries to reason with them, using the books, so they don't kill an important character. Other actors have said D&amp;D treat GoT as if it was their own, they told Nikolaj to shut up, stop arguing and just say his lines. Do you think people who get angry when presented with solid reasoning would just accept another person's views on how GoT should end? Sadly, they wouldn't even accept the author's opinon.


After reading the post [GRRM's real thoughts on the TV show, as written in FIRE AND BLOOD](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/c7keit/spoilers_extended_grrms_real_thoughts_on_the_tv/) I'm even more confident D&amp;D made their own ending. GRRM writes: **""As alteration followed alteration over the years, it became ever more difficult to ascertain which was the original text""**. People are forgetting his books are the original text, not the show, people are taking for granted what happens on the show will or did happen on the books, when that's not the case since season 5. Sure, we'd have to assume a bunch of stuff, but come on, we know GRRM wouldn't make Dany burn Kings Landing for no reason at all or make Jon completely useless against the Others and making the NK die from a random valyrian steel dagger.


Such a complex story, full of interesting characters, realistic medieval consequences for their actions, actual development and growth. I don't think it will just end with Dany being Mad Queen like her father or Jaime and Cersei dying the way they did or Jon not wanting the throne or not getting killed for murdering Dany or Bran being the king with one of the worst possible Small Councils. Doesn't matter if the way we get there changes, I honestly don't think that's the ending ASOIAF deserves. That's my opinion, but maybe a well written journey can take us to that ending and make us feel satisfied, maybe GRRM just isn't great at writing endings and it'll suck.

I guess we'll just have to wait and see. What do you guys think? How different will the last 2 books be to the last seasons of the show?",asoiaf
"Because unlike most people (Storm of Swords is the most loved in the series) second half of Dance with Dragons is my favourite part in any of the 5 books.

"Lately, I’ve been thinking about what potential clues and setup GRRM may have put in for King Bran and the ending. And I’ve been particularly intrigued by the famed “Southron ambitions” comments in ADWD.

To recap: these are a pair of brief but extremely portentous comments Lady Dustin makes to Theon, alluding to some sort of secret conspiracy that could have motivated Rickard Stark’s actions in the years before Robert’s Rebellion.

## A plan to unite five great houses

Let’s take them in reverse order. In the quote that gives the theory its name, Lady Dustin suggests the Stark/Tully betrothal was motivated by Rickard’s “Southron ambitions.”

&gt;“The day I learned that Brandon was to marry Catelyn Tully, though … there was nothing sweet about *that* pain. He never wanted her, I promise you that. He told me so, on our last night together… but Rickard Stark had great ambitions too. *Southron* ambitions that would not be served by having his heir marry the daughter of one of his own vassals.” (ADWD THEON V)

As Stefan Sasse wrote in [a great old essay](https://towerofthehand.com/blog/2012/01/05-southron-ambitions/), it does seem rather conspicuous in retrospect that the Starks, Tullys, Arryns, Baratheons, and Lannisters were all trying to get so… close in the years before the Rebellion.

* Robert Baratheon and Ned Stark were the wards of Jon Arryn
* Then there was the Brandon Stark / Catelyn Tully betrothal
* And the Robert Baratheon / Lyanna Stark betrothal
* And even a potential Jaime Lannister / Lysa Tully marriage

All this would have tied together five great houses, leaving out only Greyjoy, Tyrell, Martell… and of course Targaryen. In fact, all this seems like a rather blatant threat to the power of the Targaryens. Perhaps it even went so far as a plot to overthrow them.

## The maester's plan

Less discussed is how ""southron ambitions"" plays into a potential maester conspiracy. That is, in Lady Dustin's earlier quote, she had something else to say about Lord Rickard — that he got his ideas, including for the Tully marriage, specifically from Winterfell’s maester, who she says the bastard of an Oldtown archmaester and a Hightower girl:

&gt;""Out of gratitude we give them a place beneath our roof and make them privy to all our shames and secrets, a part of every council. And before too long, the ruler has become the ruled. That was how it was with Lord Rickard Stark. Maester Walys was his grey rat's name. And isn't it clever how the maesters go by only one name, even those who had two when they first arrived at the Citadel? That way we cannot know who they truly are or where they come from … but if you are dogged enough, you can still find out.  
&gt;  
&gt;Before he forged his chain, Maester Walys had been known as Walys Flowers. Flowers, Hill, Rivers, Snow … we give such names to baseborn children to mark them for what they are, but they are always quick to shed them. Walys Flowers had a Hightower girl for a mother … and an archmaester of the Citadel for a father, it was rumored. The grey rats are not as chaste as they would have us believe. Oldtown maesters are the worst of all. Once he forged his chain, his secret father and his friends wasted no time dispatching him to Winterfell to fill Lord Rickard's ears with poisoned words as sweet as honey. The Tully marriage was his notion, never doubt it, he—"" (ADWD THEON IV)

That bit really sticks out, particularly because Lady Dustin is interrupted and doesn't get to finish her thought. At the time, the purpose of all this mainly seemed to be backstory: more information about Robert’s Rebellion.

But is it also intended as foreshadowing and setup for the end of the series?

## The world the Citadel is building

To note the obvious: Bran Stark fulfills his grandfather Rickard’s southron ambitions, possibly beyond his wildest dreams, by becoming king of Westeros in the south.

Then there’s the role of the maesters. Oldtown is introduced with great fanfare in AFFC, getting both the prologue and the final chapter. That signifies the maesters are important in the books, in a way they never were in the show.

In particular, Marwyn reveals that the maesters killed the old Targaryen dragons, and suggests they will try to kill Dany too. This is because they are “building” a “world” in which magic will have no place:

&gt;“If I tell you, they may need to kill you too.” Marywn smiled a ghastly smile, the juice of the sourleaf running red between his teeth. “Who do you think killed all the dragons the last time around? Gallant dragonslayers armed with swords?” He spat. “The world the Citadel is building has no place in it for sorcery or prophecy or glass candles, much less for dragons. Ask yourself why Aemon Targaryen was allowed to waste his life upon the Wall, when by rights he should have been raised to archmaester. His blood was why. He could not be trusted. No more than I can.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“What will you do?” asked Alleras, the Sphinx.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Get myself to Slaver’s Bay, in Aemon’s place. The swan ship that delivered Slayer should serve my needs well enough. The grey sheep will send their man on a galley, I don’t doubt. With fair winds I should reach her first.” (AFFC SAM V)

So the maesters want the dragons and the Targaryens dead. They also want to build a new world. Perhaps that's a world with an elective rather than a hereditary monarchy? Perhaps this is what they wanted all along, back when Walys was whispering in Rickard's ear...  and perhaps they even told them he could lead that elective monarchy. That would be quite the southron ambition. And perhaps, a generation later, the old plot will be carried out by making Rickard's grandson king of Westeros.

An apparent problem for this theory is, of course, that putting the very magical Bran on the throne is an odd way to wipe out magic from the world. Yet in the world of the books, it's not necessarily clear that Bran will keep his magical abilities at the end of the series (I've thought they'd make him a bit too overpowered).

It's also not necessarily clear that Bran's magic will be common knowledge. There could be some trickery involved — that is, Sam and Tyrion could subvert the maester plot. Both of them know Bran, and Sam has experience swinging leadership elections and the inside view into the Citadel's inner workings. So they could present Bran as a mere crippled boy, the heir to Winterfell but a threat to no one... and he could end up a powerful king no one expects.

**tl;dr: ""Southron ambitions"" and the maesters' conspiracy could be setup for the end of the series — the downfall of the Targaryens, and the move of Westeros to an elective monarchy under King Bran the Broken.**",asoiaf

"And the lack of consistency sickers into every aspect of the show. This will be a long post, but I need to get this off my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

Forget realism for a second. Dragons, magic and zombies don't exist. It's fantasy. But you can establish a universe where such things do exists. It's not realistic by a long shot, but we can suspend our disbelief. After all, the rest of the world still follows pretty realistic rules regarding genetics, physics, politics etc. These are still humans, navigating an otherwise earth-like world. So we have elements of fantasy that are grounded in an otherwise realistic setting.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason we can suspend our disbelief for the fantasy elements in the first place is consistency. That's the key to establish a congruent universe and it gets misunderstood so much that it almost seems malevolent at times, especially thinking back to the Last Jedi fiasco, where, unlike this (much worse) dumpster fire, the mainstream media was against us ""haters"".

The key to a congruent fictional universe is a more or less strict set of rules that you have to follow. Those rules, like magic for example, don't have to be realistic, but once set up, you've set a precedent that the audience accepts as a natural law. If you break such a rule, you better have a damn good explanation for it. That's why you can't do a hyperspace kamikaze run. It breaks the established rules so much that you have to wonder why that hasn't been a tactic in the thousands of years since hyperspace was invented.

And especially in TV and cinema, you don't have to follow just your own rules, you also have to follow Hollywood rules, just because we are so popular. Guns and sword sound for example are very different in the real world, but the audience expects something they know, or it won't feel real to them.

For the same exact reason, we still use insanely loud vacuums and car doors. We have the technology to make them way more silent, but customers would feel like they won't work properly. Mercedes once built a very expensive car model with very quiet doors - and after many customer complaints that the doors weren't shutting properly, they recalled them and installed *speakers* that played a door shutting sound to it would feel satisfying.

&amp;#x200B;

But you can still do crazy shit. In fact, in-universe restrictions are not restrictions on creativity. The opposite is the case, restrictions *foster* creativity - if you're not a lazy hack, that is. Faced with a problem, you have to come up with a congruent way to solve that, without introducing a plot device, be it magic, a McGuffin, techno babble or a deus ex machina.

&amp;#x200B;

That's where ASOIAF succeeded and the show fails massively. One thing GRRM did extraordinarily well was setting up a world that's grounded in realism. Characters, even main characters, are no superheroes like classic fantasy protagonists. They too face the same consequences that red shirts do. How did he do that? Most prominently by killing off the main character of the first book. And it wasn't for shock value, it was to demonstrate that this is *not* a fairy tale! Even main characters face the consequences of their actions. Being honorable, careless or romantic can easily get you killed if you face more ruthless opponents.

Sure it was a shock. It did subvert our expectations. But in hindsight, we (and probably Ned) should have seen it coming. We were able to reflect, re-read and re-watch to conclude that Ned's strategy wasn't the best. It was unexpected, but it made sense, given the ruthless and gritty world we are shown. That creates a lot of tension and that's why we kept watching, not because we were lusting for the spectacle of another protagonist's death.

&amp;#x200B;

A more direct comparison is the smallfolk of King's Landing. Early on we see them in open revolt when they are starving under King Joffrey. We also see how the great noble houses react if you imprison, attempt to or are falsely accused of assassinating a family member. And a few seasons later, that same society is completely idle when a usurper queen blows up the Westeros equivalent of the Vatican along with very prominent and popular aristocracy? Actually we can only assume idleness, since we never actually see any of the political consequences because everybody just fucks off back home.

&amp;#x200B;

Something even more obvious is distance. The early seasons did a very good job of conveying the passage of time, especially during travel. Some characters were just busy riding from A to B off screen for a few episodes. For others, stuff happened during their travel, most notably Tyrion during the way to the Eyrie and back home. Gendry just rowed a boat for who knows how long. Hell, we missed most of the battles of the War of the Five Kings, but we still got mostly filled in in the form of ravens, strategy meetings and more personal dialogue, like Robb and Edmure regarding the Mountain and a mill.

There are precedents, not only how big and vast the continent is, but also, on a more meta level, how you can convey that distance to the reader/viewer, even if it was for budget reasons at first.

That's why people feel that the last few seasons were rushed. During the stupid Capture-The-Wight sidequest, Gendry, only trained in long-distance rowing, sprints from the True North to the Wall, sends a Raven to Dragonstone and has Dany fling back to the Far North without GPS assistance in what seems to be a single night, when previously, just the way to the Wall would have taken several weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

Armor is similarly treated. I can generally forgive the lack of helmets: Really useful, but for cinematographic reasons, you would want the audience to see and recognize their protagonists - although there are methods to convey that a bit more realistically, at least for royalty. Bobby B for example was famous for his antler helmet and his warhammer.

And yes, armor is generally very poorly treated in fantasy. But in season 1, we see Jorah demonstrating how useful plate armor is by catching an Arakh in it and instantly winning the fight. In Season 4, Bronn explains why a mobile and nimble fighter/a rogue  would take a great risk facing the Mountain/a tank and after Oberyn exploits weaknesses in the Mountain's armor, Bronn's prediction comes true: One mistake and you're dead.

Then we see the same character, Jorah, getting stabbed through his plate armor by a rusty dagger, Theon getting stabbed through plate by the **wooden end** of a spear and the Hound impales the Mountain through plate and chain armor and it *goes all the way through!*

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest thread for consistency in a character driven show are of course the characters. And of course, characters can change. We see that in Jamie before somebody accidentally pushed his reset-button (Finger in the bum maybe?).

In seasons 1-4 the story was primarily driven by characters reacting to their environment. After that, especially starting with season 6, we just saw them going from A to B, checking off plot points. That's why Tyrion is suddenly a moron. That's why we diverted from ""show, not tell"", and Sansa is suddenly the smartest person alive cause Arya told us so.

But hell, even in season 7, there's still a bit of good left. Watch Dany's and Jon's first encounter and watch their wills clash because they are equally stubborn. Yeah, Jon's socially awkward, but watch Dany develop an interest in Jon because he has no time for this childish squabbeling and stands up to her without bending the knee. Aaaand then he gets reduced to  a complete sock puppet without any free will.

Or Dany, getting suddenly depressed because nobody loves her because Tormund suddenly forgot he rode a dragon too because the plot demanded it - when she knows exactly how to charm the smallfolk into a great stagedive. And that woman who was always concerned with the smallfolk and has seemingly learned to cope with losses, tragedy, cruelty and hardship, that women, in the face of the surrender of her arch enemy, now burns **everything but** her arch enemy?

And I'm supposed to buy that? Yeah, she has shown impatience, overreactions and cruelty - towards the people in power, not towards women and children! Have another season to render her more paranoid and burn a few nobles for it, then I'd buy it, but this ain't Dany. Gods, even Dany haters hate her heel turn!

&amp;#x200B;

And I feel like the impersonation of all these flaws is Euron fucking Greyjoy. He is hellbent on putting a prince into Cersei's belly, then doesn't even flinch when Tyrion mentions her pregnancy during the Parlay. His aim and his scorpions are always just as good or bad as the plots needs them to be. He seems to have a radar (which would be fine if he was more like the books). He swims miles in minutes for a fanservice showdown we didn't even want because those two didn't have any history (even Jamie was like ""What!?""). He boasts about being the killer of Jamie, despite not killing him at all, despite Jamie losing his legendary fighter status a few seasons ago and despite Euron killing A FUCKING DRAGON a week ago with a triple 360 noscope MLG shot!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To close it off: This is why I think it's worse than Disney Star Wars:

There's the sheer number of assassinated characters. Disney only sucessfully ruined the OT characters, a spaceship (which I didn't think was possible) and then TLJ came along and ruined the new characters as well! But you can still watch the original trilogy in isolation and get a complete, consistent and coherent story. Maybe even add the prequels, the only major thing you have to headcanon out are the midichlorians.

But Game Of Thrones... it's one continuity, there's no part you can leave out to get something complete. Maybe watch 1-6 and watch Dorne as a buddy comedy to end with a cliffhanger. I would recommend watching 1-4, then read all the books, but let's be honest here: We will never get the books either.",asoiaf

"While the people of Westeros don't have ALL the clues that book readers have in order to put together L + R = J (no ""promise me Ned"" thoughts, for one), they have enough that at the very least, the idea that Rhaegar is Jon Snow's father and Lyanna his mother must at least be an in-universe conspiracy theory, right?

Here are some facts that just about anyone in Westeros could know: Rhaegar ""kidnapped"" Lyanna, then disappeared with her somewhere in the South for several months. After the taking of Kings Landing, Ned went south with some companions looking for Lyanna. Lyanna died of something either before or shortly after Ned found her, then Ned reappeared with her bones and a baby some months after after delivering Arthur Dayne's sword to Starfall. There's certainly no proof, but that ain't the toughest nut in the Seven Kingdoms to crack either.

The consensus in-universe seems to be that Ned had Jon at Starfall, either with Ashara or Wylla, but the truth (or at least what readers assume is the truth) really isn't THAT tough to puzzle out from what the general public knows. Even if you didn't know that Lyanna and Rhaegar eloped, their mutual monthslong disappearance + Lyanna's unexplained death (in a world where death by childbirth would be relatively common) + Ned reappearing with a mysterious baby, I mean...that HAS to have sparked at least a few people to put the truth more or less together.

Obviously GRRM wouldn't actually show these mostly correct theories/rumors to the reader to avoid ruining the surprise, but it MUST be at least a moderately widespread rumor in-universe. Right?",asoiaf
"In *Fire and Blood*, there's a section about an in-universe book called *A Caution for Young Girls*, and it's described as a really trashy morality tale meant to appeal to lowbrow audiences. At first, it sounds like the Westerosi equivalent to an airport novel. But then Martin has some odd word choice to describe the text:

&gt; ""We have no way to ascertain the veracity of her story, nor even whether she was in truth the author of this infamous book (some argue plausibly that the text is the product of several hands, for the style of the prose varies greatly from **episode** to **episode**)."" (*Fire and Blood*, p. 157)

I guess *A Caution for Young Girls* could be a televised soap, since it was written in episodes. Maybe a show for Lifetime or.... HBO?

Martin continues to theorize on the disputed authorship of *Caution*:

&gt; ""The scribes responsible were most likely septons expelled from the Faith for drunkenness, theft, or fornication, failed students who left the Citadel without a chain, hired quills from the Free Cities, or mummers (the worst of all). **Lacking the rigor of maesters, such scribes oft feel free to “improve” on the texts they are copying. (Mummers in particular are prone to this.)**
In the case of *A Caution for Young Girls*, **such “improvements” largely consisted of adding ever more episodes of depravity and changing the existing episodes** to make them even more disturbing and lascivious. **As alteration followed alteration over the years, it became ever more difficult to ascertain which was the original text,** to the extent that even maesters at the Citadel cannot agree as to the title of the book, as has been noted.” (*Fire and Blood*, p.158-9)

So it appears the writers of *Caution* were adapting from an existing story, thought they could improve it with unnecessary changes, and ended up making a flashy, but culturally empty work. I wonder where else we've seen something like this...",asoiaf

"# Toy Soldier Theory

Back in 2016, before Jon Snow was resurrected on the show, I wrote [this tinfoily theory](https://weirwoodleviathan.wordpress.com/2016/04/27/iii-now-i-am-become-death-legacy-of-a-toy-soldier/) (I kinda hate linking people to this because in hindsight I think the theory is so silly, and reveals how goofy my writing style was) that Jon's soul wouldn't really ever return to his body from Ghost. That instead, the big twist of the series would be that Bran reanimates Jon's dead body with his own soul, and lives out the Azor Ahai/TPTWP myth through Jon. I speculated that because of the way skinchanging works, we would no longer get Jon's POV, and Bran would experience his time in Jon's body like a dream, slowly losing himself to the identity of the body he's inhabiting.

This became known a ""Toy Soldier theory.""

This theory was loosely inspired by The Never Ending Story, and was my attempt to reconcile Martin's seemingly inconsistent portrayals of resurrection, and the common chosen one imagery associated with both Jon and Bran. Despite all of the King setup for Jon, I always felt the story was ultimately about putting Bran into power, so I was trying to figure a way to that. Though it never got much mainstream love from the authorities within the fandom, it was received surprisingly well considering that it asserted Jon's story pretty much ends in ADWD. Given the timing I get it though. We were nearing Jon's resurrection, and people were having last minute doubts.

Of course, eventually I abandoned the theory and started to see the need for Jon's internal story to continue. Besides, as it turns out GRRM had confirmed that Jon will eventually learn the truth of his parentage, which was incompatible with Bran controlling Jon's dead body. I moved on, and sort f just let Toy Soldier theory die.

Or so I thought.

After the ending revealed King Bran, the premise of Toy Soldier theory made a sudden comeback. An old theory I had which I now considered ridiculous, was suddenly all the rage. Getting over 8k upvotes [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/btfx0g/spoilers_extended_theres_a_plot_thread_missing/), and even being [suggested as a plausible ending](https://youtu.be/50aa3Ahzr9s?t=1370) by u/Elio_Garcia and Linda (though they swapped King Jon ""the Winged Wolf"" out for King Euron ""Crow's Eye."") Either way, we got a twist ending and now my weird theory is getting a lot of attention.

And I'm just over here like... *guys, wtf.*

# The Implausibility of a Body Snatcher King

It's hard to determine just where to begin dismantling my theory, because I'm very aware that not everyone who now ascribes to it believes in an identical version to the one I initially put forward. But generally speaking, I now consider an ending where Bran bodysnatches his way to the throne is implausible. **The premise undermines the point of the ending, isn't set up by Bran's arc, isn't how warging actually works, and is just too dark to end the story with a never ending mind rape, whether the victim is the hero, or the villain.**

The moment I knew with full confidence that King Bran was absolutely from GRRM, was when Tyrion said ""Bran the Broken."" Not only because this is a phrase never set up in the show, but used extensively in the books to highlight the central obstacle of Bran's story, but because it encapsulated the underlying point of the ending. That the person at one point seen as ""broken"" was now being hailed for that very thing. Westeros had found it's [Bran the Blessed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%A2n_the_Blessed). It's [Fischer King.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_King)

Of course, this premise (which I would never ever ever expect D&amp;D could come up with), is completely undermined if the ascension to Kingship is done through body snatching. If Westeros is hailing ""King Aegon VII"" or ""King Euron Crow's Eye"" while Bran is secretly pulling the strings (but the Old Gods are pulling the strings behind him?), then there is no subversion or celebration of Bran the Broken. It remains Bran's point of shame, and it's never made into Bran's strength (as Tyrion would advise).

A body snatcher king ending is also pretty messed up for Bran's arc.

When I initially posited that Bran skinchange Jon, it was the accidental skinchanging of a dead body, and the reason he remained was that he could live out his deep seated desire to be a knight. This kind of thing vaguely made sense for Bran in light of how he'd skinchange Hodor really just to walk and feel whole again, and to be included. This sympathetic motivation is contrasted against the utter horror of what Bran is doing, which is essentially likened to rape, and called ""abomination.""

But to have Bran commit this sort of atrocity at the end for the sake of some kind of political motivation is not only very dark, it's not set up in Bran's character. For me, the implication behind ""Hold the Door"" seems to be that Bran will come to see the evil in what he has been doing to Hodor, and have some kind of change of heart or come to some kind of moral awakening. Yet if this 10 year old goes from mid raping Hodor to compensate for his disability, to mind raping someone else to exert control over Westeros, then there is no lesson. This is especially true if the person being skinchanged is a family member, or an innocent, but also true if it's a villain like Euron.

What's more, I don't think this ending really fully takes into consideration the consequences of skinchanging. As we have seen throughout the story, skinchanging another entity has consequences on both entities. When Bran wargs into Summer, he effectively becomes Summer. He is filled with Summer's desires, and perceives as Summer does. So if Bran were to hypothetically warg into Euron, it wouldn't be a simple mind replacement. Bran would effectively start to become more like Euron, and take on attributes of Euron's persona and desires. A King Euron who is possessed by Bran would not simply be King Bran in Euron's body, it would be a merging of both characters into one being. The spectre of Euron Crow's Eye would always be there, influencing the thoughts and actions of the endgame king.

But even on the off chance that Bran was somehow able to compartmentalize Euron, or Jon, or whoever he was supposedly body snatching. Such an ending is just too dark to ever be considered bittersweet. Martin's exploration of power would effectively end on the most horrific tool for domination in the story being used in the most immoral possible way, destroying the life of not only the person being body snatched, but the body snatcher. Bran (who has no desire to be king), would get to walk again, but lose himself, lose his identity, leave his life, and on top of all that be alone and forgotten, and in perpetual violation of another person. Not as a puppet, nor even as a puppet master, but as the strings.

&amp;#x200B;

**In conclusion, though the premise of Bran the Body Snatcher is fun tinfoil to consider, and could have made for an interesting story in another world, it's just not super plausible and becomes far too sinister an ending to ever fit the definition of ""bittersweet."" Whether he's possessing Jon, or Euron, or Moonboy for all we know, perpetual mind rape is neither a lasting solution for Westeros, nor a satisfying ending for Bran. Thus, it's time to put away Toy Soldier theory.**",asoiaf

"The consensus on this sub is that GRRM will never finish ASOIAF. I can only see two eventual outcomes:

1. The series remains unfinished. All we have is fan fiction (incl. the show), and our own imagination, to fill in the gaps and conclude character arcs. Unfinished chapters and notes may eventually be released, giving at least some closure.
2. The series is finished by another writer. I don't think this can produce a satisfactory narrative. For GRRM, ASOIAF is his magnus opus. It is what he will be always remembered for. This adds a tremendous incentive to make it as good as possible, sinking years of effort into each book to make it compelling and consistent. This kind of motivation would simply not be present for any other writer, no matter how much money people throw at him. Even if he is as skilled as GRRM, he won't be motivated enough to finish ASOIAF in a way it deserves.

But what if George decides that finishing the series is too hard, and opts instead to release the rest of the narrative in a dry tone reminiscent of Fire &amp; Blood? He would be able to resolve all the plot points, answer all the questions, and conclude character arcs in a satisfactory manner. And it would be vastly less time-consuming to write. The downside is, that it would not be enjoyable to read, and practically all the elements that make ASOIAF great (apart from the story) would be absent. Think unreliable narrators, incomplete information, character struggle from their POVs, food description, etc.

Is this better than the other two alternatives?",asoiaf
"There are 4 ethnicities that are well represented within the ASOIAF books — First Men, Rhoynar, Andals and Valyrians. I've been thinking about these ethnicities, and the fairly sparse description that GRRM likes to give us of each character, and I came to the conclusion that, given that this is a fictional world with fictional races, there is absolutely no reason for us to assume that any ethnicities in ASOIAF are perfect analogues for real life ethnicities, just as there is no ""Latin"" or ""English"" language but languages that are somewhat inspired by them.

Furthermore, it made little sense to me that GRRM would make this distinction between races and yet have 3 of them be essentially Caucasian. So partly because I have way too much time on my hands, and partly because I wanted to ""diversify"" the series while remaining true to canon and without shoehorning in POC characters, I decided to speculate on what these ethnicities would actually look like.

We can start with the First Men. As far as book canon goes, there is little to differentiate them physically from Andals (differences are generally cultural), not because they aren't different but because of centuries, if not millennia, of interbreeding between the two. We do know, however, that the First Men are better represented in the North, specifically by the Wildlings, the Starks, the Boltons and other Houses, with the addition of the mountain clans of the Vale. Based on the descriptions we are given, we can construct the beginnings of a First Men phenotype:

\- A range of hair colors and styles, ranging from dark to red (but rarely blond) and generally straight or wavy (rarely curly)

\- Eyes also have a wide range, but distinct blue and green colors also seem rare, with grey and dark eyes being common

\- The Starks are said to have long faces, other First Men can be assumed to have neither long nor short faces, so we can assume dolichocephaly and mesocephaly

\- The presence or absence of epicanthic folds is difficult to infer as eyes are generally only described by color in ASOIAF

\- Based on the size of the Umbers, we can guess that the First Men are tall

\- Skin color, if I remember correctly, is never explicitly stated for any northerners or wildlings, but we can assume it to be on the lighter end of the spectrum due to them living in cold climates. However, this does not necessarily mean fair skin — it could range from light brown to pale. What we do know is that Valyrians and Qartheen are paler, and salty/sandy Dornish and Dothraki are darker.

\- Body and facial hair is clearly common as almost all male Northern and Wildling characters have beards

\- First men appear to have a range of body types - Arya, for example, appears to be quite skinny, whilst the Greatjon is a large, stocky man.

To have a better idea of our First Men phenotype, we can look at their origins, which, if the wiki is to be believed, are in the Dothraki sea. An adaptation for grassland life seems to match with the features I described, and also implies brachyskelia and a lack of epicanthic fold, as well as supporting the idea of the First Men having light brown rather than fair skin (at least originally). Note that what I am describing is somewhat similar to how Dothraki have been described, which makes sense as they appear to originate from the same area.

Finally, we can draw parallels with real life ethnicities, while acknowledging that First Men won't correspond perfectly to any real ethnicity. Although culturally, Westeros is similar to medieval western Europe, geographically it is more similar to America. Based on this idea, an indigenous race with a variety of religions and whose culture has mostly died out apart from a few pockets seems very similar to the Native Americans. We can expect our First Men, then, to be *somewhat* similar to Native American peoples — but importantly, not a copy paste of them.

&amp;#x200B;

Using this same method, I created other phenotypes for the other ethnicities.

&amp;#x200B;

Andals:

Similar to Caucasians, but with coarser hair, weak facial and body hair, and epicanthic folds. Shorter and stockier than First Men; macroskelic, brachycephalic, mildly hypsicranic, and hyperleptorrhine. Tend towards endomorphia. Pale skin, wide range of eye color and hair color.

&amp;#x200B;

Rhoynish:

My interpretation is based upon peoples from the Nile River, hence medium brown skin, curly black hair, dark eyes, strong facial and body hair. They are described in ASOIAF as ""lithe"", leading me to assume  ectomorphic, short and brachyskelic proportions. No epicanthic folds, platyrrhine nose, dolichocephalic.

&amp;#x200B;

Valyrians:

Here I differ most from most interpretations. The geographic location of the Valyrian peninsula suggests to me India, and thus I am inclined to draw inspiration from Indian peoples — the obvious problem is that Valyrians have pale hair and skin and purple eyes. Purple eyes are not common (or even possible) in any real life humans, so I resorted to magic here: the Valyrian's appearance reminds me of the Others. They are speculated to have learned to tame dragons from an earlier, now disappeared race who I theorize were the ""fire"" counterpart to Others. Some interbreeding happened, and at least the ruling class (the dragonlords) began to inherit these pale features and purple eyes, resorting to incest to keep these features pure. I imagine the smallfolk of the Valyrian freehold would have had darker features, looking more like the real world's Indian people.

&amp;#x200B;

Aided by the images and explanations of [http://humanphenotypes.net/](http://humanphenotypes.net/), and with some poor photoshop work, I created some visual representations of my interpretation.

"Bran becoming the King turned out to be a very controversial ending. Even more so because it was confirmed to be the book ending as well. Even leaving the horrible execution of the scene aside, many people take issue with the idea of King Bran itself, either claiming that it will suck in the books just like in the showl or, bizarrely, saying that the books will end differently despite us being directly told that the major beats of the ending will be the same and that King Bran is George's idea.

I tend to think that the idea itself is rather interesting, and can work in the books. So in this post, i'll try to adress the popular criticisms of *Bran the Broke*n and prove to you that it can, and hopefully will work in the hands of GRRM.

* **Bran has no claim**

*The Starks have never ruled anything but the North. They are not related to Targaryens in any way, so they can't make a claim like Robert.*

First of all, with all Targaryens either dead or out of the picture, no one has a strong claim. And the bunring of the iron throne is suppose to imply the end of an era. So a new king will not be chosen based on his relation to the previoud dynasty.  New dynasty, new king, new rules.

* **Why would anyone choose Bran at the Great Council?**

*Bran's name comes up very randomly during the Castle. ""Who has a better story than Bran the Broken?"", Tyrion says, and for some reason eveyone accepts it as a valid arguments and they problaim Bran the King. Why would they do that? Wouldn't each of the high lords want to make a claim?*

Yes, this was stupid. What this shows us is that D&amp;D knew they had to make Bran the King, but had no idea how to make it happen. And while the power of stories is indeed a bif theme in his story, it's definitely not enough. There need to be more. There needs to be an actual in-universe reason for it.

I think the big difference that will lead to Bran's reign is the global changes in the Westeros landscape. The Long Night was not really long in the show. But i have no doubt that GRRM is planning to deliver on the horrors he set up, and the Others won'be be defeated in on single fight. The Long Night in the books is the event that will completely change everything.

The Others, the Dragons, Greenseers and Skinchangers, Red Priests, Faceless Men and undead of all types... These are the figures that will take the central stage in the last act of the story. The show always downplayed such elements and their influence on the world as a whole (just look at how no one cares about Jon's resurrection), but in the books it will change Westeros on a fundamental level.

How will it lead to Bran the Broken? Well, first of all, if Bran plays a major role in defeating the Others, he will earn the claim on that merit alone.

&gt;Lord Seaworth is a man of humble birth, but he reminded me of my duty, when all I could think of was my rights. I had the cart before the horse, Davos said. I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne.

In ASOS, Davos reminds Stannis that he has to defend his realm, or he is no king at all. Because what are kings for, if not for protecting their people? Well, it probably won't end well Stannis, but this logic may put Bran on the throne at the end. After the War for the Dawn, people will look at those who saved them as their new leaders.

Second, in a world that was almost ended by a supernatural threat, it makes total sense to elect someone who'll be able to deal with these types of issues in the future. With Dany dead, who is the next candidate from this perspective?

Another big point in Bran's favor is that in many ways, he is the most inoffensive choice. Due to being removed from the political realm for so long, he hasn't made many enemies. So i can totally see him being a compromise option.

* **Why won't the lords of the seven kingdoms just declare independence?**

*Sansa proclaims the North independent, and no one is bothered. Why don't the Iron Islands and Dorne separate as well? Yara was even promised independence by Daenerys!*

I think independant North is an obvious show invention. They really wanted to have that *""Queen in the North""* moment. But it makes no sense. You can't have North separating and everyone else being okay with it.

Even more important, it makes zero narrative sense. The Others are the ultimate proof, that the realm needs to be united. Divided kingdom is a weak one. Fighting over lands, gold and power is exactly what will bring Westeros at the bring of destruction when the Long Night comes. Uniting is what will save it.

Therefore, it makes no sense for the Kingdoms to immediately separate after learning the ultimate lesson about the need for unity.

* **Bran is too young and unexperienced**

*Bran is about 7 years old at the start of the story and 10 by the end of ADWD. How do you make him the endgame king in a believable and satisfying way?*

Age is an issue, that's true. But that's the price of abandoning the infamous five year gap.  As GRRM himself has said: *""If a twelve-year old has to conquer the world, then so be it.""*

I also think GRRM may have found a way to write his way around Bran's age. Bloodraven.

Since the beginning of season 7, the show has been saying that Bran *""is not longer Bran but a Three Eyed Raven""*. And despite the poor execution, that turned Bran into a boring non-character throwing lines from previous seasons at people, the idea itself is so in-line with GRRM's writing, that i find it hard to believe it didn't come from him. *Divine power comes with a price.*

&gt;Stay, and the Many-Faced God will take your ears, your nose, your tongue. He will take your sad grey eyes that have seen so much. He will take your hands, your feet, your arms and legs, your private parts. He will take your hopes and dreams, your loves and hates.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Can I dwell on what I scarce remember? I held a castle on the Marches once, and there was a woman I was pledged to marry, but I could not find that castle today, nor tell you the color of that woman's hair. Who knighted me, old friend? What were my favorite foods? It all fades. Sometimes I think I was born on the bloody grass in that grove of ash, with the taste of fire in my mouth and a hole in my chest. Are you my mother, Thoros?""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""I ate,"" said Bran. ""We ran down an elk and had to drive off a treecat that tried to steal him."" The cat had been tan-and-brown, only half the size of the direwolves, but fierce. He remembered the musky smell of him, and the way he had snarled down at them from the limb of the oak.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The wolf ate,"" Jojen said. ""Not you. Take care, Bran. *Remember who you are*.""

The idea, that the active use of magic can cost you your own soul is ever present in the books. So Bran and never been the same after is as GRRM as it gets.

But how exactly will Bran change? Well, once again, i think the show got the basics of this correct. Bran will be merged with Bloodraven.

&gt;Before long he was flying around the cavern, weaving through the long stone teeth that hung down from the ceiling, even flapping out over the abyss and swooping down into its cold black depths.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then he realized he was not alone.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Someone else was in the raven,"" he told Lord Brynden, once he had returned to his own skin. ""Some girl. I felt her.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""A woman, of those who sing the song of earth,"" his teacher said. ""Long dead, yet a part of her remains, just as a part of you would remain in Summer if your boy's flesh were to die upon the morrow. A shadow on the soul. She will not harm you.""  
&gt;  
&gt;*Bran III, ADWD*

From Bran, to Orell to Varamyr - the idea of skinchangers living a second life inside their animals is well established. And Varamyr's Prologue establishes another important aspect - trying to take away another human's body.

So if we take this ideas and apply them to the show's context, what will we get? Bloodraven reaching for Bran in his dying moments, either trying to pass some knowledge to him or possible to take over his body and in the process imprinting himself on Bran. *A shadow on the soul.*

I think in one way or the other, some of Bloodraven's experiences, secrets and character traits will be passed to Bran. And Bloodraven used to be the hand of the king. He was a greenseer and a ruler of Westeros before Bran. He is the precedent, a blueprint for Bran the Broken. And a shadow of Bloodraven on Bran's soul will probably be an big part of Bran's character till the very end.

I think this may be GRRM's cheat code to make some radical changes to Bran's character without 5 year gap to work with. And Jon Snow's death and resurrection will probably serve a similar function.

* **How is becoming King a satisfying end for Bran?**

*Bran's story was always magic based. The first two books had him learing how to be a lord/a prince, but even then there was always a sense that the endgame for Bran will be all about magic.*

Well, what would be a perfect ending for Bran? Most people tend to say, that it would be him becoming some sort of magical protector, looking over Westeros using his powers. And i agree. *But that's exactly the type of king he's going to be.*

Like i said before, the world will be a very different place by the end of ASOIAF. The magical realm was in the background at the beginning. The Others slowly returning beyond the Wall, the dragons, children of the forest and the giants all thought to be gone forever... And since the end of the first book, magic has been slowly finding it's back into the world.

By the end of the story, the magical and political realm will be deeply tied together. So Brandon Stark, someone who was raised as a lord and then was trained to be a greenseer, works rather well as the endgame ruler. So instead of a king on the Iron Throne, we'll have a greenseer on a weirwood throne. Symbolising transition to a world of high fantasy.

"So I am just starting up the Dance of the Dragons section of “Fire and Blood”. I already know the story vaguely from having listened to an audiobook version of the Princess and the Queen and done some reading in the past

I find myself almost wholly in favour of one side over the other - The Blacks

I was wondering if this was supposed to be the reading or if others interpreted this differently 

Perhaps my bias might come from how clearly this is based mostly on the Anarchy in real history and how Aegon, despite being a true born son in this telling is the parallel of Stephen of Blois - the one with the much weaker claim in the Anarchy (I guess only if you discount the gender thing)

Or perhaps it is just how clearly the previous king had made his decision in both cases and had it schemed away

So is George supposed to be leading us to a certain view? Or a view that both were as bad as each other 

Is all the council stuff supposed to make us see that the greens at least had a good argument in their own minds established by some degree of precedent ? I just have absolutely no sympathy for them for defying the clear will of their monarch. (And yes this has happened countless times in real history , not just the Anarchy parallel )

(Note: this is all based on the pre War part and actions around the outbreak - not actions during which if i recall cast a negative light on both sides)",asoiaf
"I’m not sure if this was mentioned in PJ’s Dornish Master Plan videos (it’s been a while), so if it’s in there nvm. This quote stuck out and reminded me of the large role the relationship between Oberyn and Marwyn plays in the DMP. 

In Sansa I ASOS, Olenna and Margaery are telling Sansa about her grandson Willas: 

“‘He was hurt as a squire, riding in his first tourney,’ Margaery confided. ‘His horse fell and crushed his leg. That snake of a Dornishman was to blame, that Oberyn Martell. And his maester as well.” 

Maybe this gives some chronology to Oberyn’s adventures with Marwyn because Willas is Mace’s oldest son and heir. Also it points to some anti-Tyrell scheming on their part. I wonder how that might play into a potential Rhoynish Restoration Plan or if it’s just another instance of the Tyrell-Martell animosity.

EDIT: throwaway line from Margaery whoops",asoiaf
"In AGOT, Grand Maester Pycelle offers Ned Stark a glass of iced milk when Ned arrives to question him about Jon Arryn's death:

&gt;""Wine no longer agrees with my digestion, I fear, but I can offer you a cup of iced milk, sweetened with honey. I find it most refreshing in this heat.”

Pycelle also tells Ned that Jon Arryn was fond of iced wine, and iced summerwine is served at the Hand's tourney.

&gt;“No,” Joffrey said. “My dog will do for him, or perhaps my uncle Jaime. And in a few years, when I am old enough to enter the lists, I shall do for them all.” He raised his hand to summon a servant with a flagon of iced summerwine, and poured her a cup.

Although [ice has long been used for preserving food](https://www.antiqueicetoolmuseum.org/industry-history/), iced drinks are decidedly not medieval and didn't exist until the 19th century, when an American trader [popularised them in order to increase the demand for ice.](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/04/history-of-ice-in-cocktails.html). 

Looking for an in-universe explanation - given how long summers in Westeros can be, it's very possible that the idea of using ice to cool drinks appeared earlier on than it did in our world. Transportation and storage costs would have made ice a very expensive commodity, and available only to the nobility - which fits in perfectly with AGOT, where only those in the royal court seem to have iced drinks. The Night's Watch (and presumably others in the far north) are an obvious exception, since temperatures at the Wall seem to remain mostly subzero even in the summers.

&gt;“From the Lord Commander’s own table,” Bowen Marsh told them. There were salads of spinach and chickpeas and turnip greens, and afterward bowls of iced blueberries and sweet cream.

Since there are no mentions of characters having iced drinks in ACOK, ASOS, and AFFC, I like to assume that ice is harvested in the far north, and the ice trade with the south has been disrupted due to the War of the Five Kings. It's also possible that with the summer drawing to an end, iced drinks are no longer in much demand. Unfortunately, the books don't seem to mention ice harvesting as a source of wealth for the North or even the Night's Watch, and matters are complicated in ADWD:

&gt;She would rather have drifted in the fragrant pool all day, eating iced fruit off silver trays and dreaming of a house with a red door, but a queen belongs to her people, not to herself. - Daenerys, ADWD

I have no idea how Meereen, a recently sacked city in the middle of war-torn Slaver's Bay, is getting supplies of ice. Does anyone have any in-universe explanations?

ETA - I found another troubling iced drink mention in ADWD. Tyrion notices that a popular inn in Volantis, which has an extremely hot climate, is serving iced drinks. These are clearly not reserved for the aristocracy, because Penny and the Widow of the Waterfront are staying there.

&gt;The common room of the Merchant’s House was a dim labyrinth of alcoves and grottoes built around a central courtyard where a trellis of flowering vines threw intricate patterns across the flagstone floor and green and purple moss grew between the stones. Slave girls scurried through light and shadow, bearing flagons of ale and wine and some iced green drink that smelled of mint.",asoiaf
"We are 5 books into a 7 book series.
There are 2 unpublished books left to resolve all the many plots and sub-plots. 
I am concerned (not worried) that there isn't enough room to give them satisfactory resolutions.

I personally would prefer to have 8 or 9 books. Now that the TV adaptation is over, I am in no rush to reach the end of the story.

"I'm putting together a map of which lords control which areas of the Seven Kingdoms and I'm coming to a blank on Stoney Sept. For such a prominent, visited place, I can't seem to a definitive answer of who is the lord of it, or a minimum whose land it is on. Geographically it seems to be closest to House Vance of Wayfarer's Rest, but they are never said to be the lords of it.

"This is my first question here as I have been enjoying reading other's posts gere for quite a while now. I have read the books once and am currently on my first re-read of AGoT.

"For fun, I wanted to ask any and all fans of ASOIAF to see how they feel about certain moments of Westerosi history as well as their own theories to major mysteries. 

To be fair, I share my own answers.  

1. Greens or Blacks?   
Blacks. Rhaenyra was declared the King's Heir, and the lords swore holy oaths to uphold this. She was the rightful heir to the throne. 
2. Red or Black Dragon?  
Black Dragon. If I was a person in Westeros I would have nothing but confusion that would lead me to supporting Daemon. The King gave Blackfyre, the sword of the Conqueror, that had been held by every Targaryen King to Daemon. Why would he do that if not to show his favor to Daemon? Also, Aegon the Unworthy always doubted Daeron's legitimacy. So much doubt.
3. Robert or Rhaegar?  
Because no one would know how/why Rhaegar abducted Lyanna, Robert would be who I supported. Robert was fighting for a seemingly noble cause and to end a tyrannical reign. Rhaegar was officially fighting for his father, which was not an appealing prospect by that point.
4. Baelor, starved or poisoned?  
Probably poisoned. Baelor was losing what shreds of sanity he had as he ventured more into his piety. He probably was planning to go to war. Viserys II had to stop his nephew from starting another civil war. 
5. Viserys II, old or poisoned?  
I will give Aegon IV the miniscule benefit of the doubt and say that Viserys II probably was just old. It would be a fitting irony if Viserys II poisoned the last King only to be poisoned himself. But Aegon IV seems a little too lazy to even do a murderous plot.
6. Best Aegon?  
Egg. Easy.
7. Worst person to sit on the Iron Throne?  
In many ways, Aerys I may be the actual worst for his complete disinterest in ruling. If not for Bloodraven, Aerys I's reign would have been an utter disaster. But definitely it goes down to Aegon IV for ending up creating a rival family for the throne which led to a century of civil wars. Thanks!
8. What happened at Summerhall?  
I am sadly with Steven Attewell, Egg was desperate enough to attempt to sacrifice Baby Rhaegar to bring forth the dragons. Dunk stopped him, causing a disaster that destroyed Summerhall. Dunk saved Rhaegar, and Aerys II.
9. What was going on between Ashara Dayne and Ned Stark?  
A short summer romance that the honorable Ned Stark put aside to do his duty and marry Catelyn Tully. The final fate of Ashara Dayne is a little too fairy tale for ASOIAF.
10. Best Hand of the King?  
Tie between Viserys II and Bloodraven. I admire Hands who have to overcome the inadequacies of their King.",asoiaf
"Despite their rumored animosity, Dorne and the Reach have more or less been united since Daeron II came to power. The major lords of the Reach supported Daeron II along with Dorne and they were unified in the War of the Ninepenny Kings. I think Mace Tyrell even planned to wed his heir Willas to Princess Arianne Martell and we know how close Willas and Oberyn were. 

Both regions are Targaryen loyalists, supporting them even when the Targaryen on the throne is a dangerous psychopath and genocidal maniac. I think they will unite again under fAegon and/or Daenaerys. I think it is even foreshadowed given how upset Lord Rowan was when Tywin mentioned Elia Martell and her children. 

So I think we will see these two regions finally joining in harmony by the end of the series with a marriage between Willas and Arianne.",asoiaf
"I would have loved to see some excuse for the show to visit the Isle, even though I'm not sure it ever gets visited in the books either (I'm only at the end Book 1, but have read a lot of the wiki). It just seems like one of those vaguely fantastic areas (like the Wall or the cellar of the Red Keep) that would have been cool to see depicted. I mean, it's actually _within_ Westeros, so it could have been pretty easy to get sidetracked to.

Are there any other areas like that in the book that missed that opportunity of being in the show?",asoiaf
"I am not referring to the tv show. In the show she is very clearly a tomboy. Someone who is more like an Ayra all grown up but without quite as much privilege. However, her characterization in the books is markedly different. I am only nearing the end of Storm but the behavior of Brienne deviates so dramatically from the other female characters on the show. Unlike Ayra she deeply resents the idea of being referred to as a woman. Which to note is a significant difference than disliking being treated as a girl. One denotes a rejection of sexism, the other an incongruence with your sense of self. Even in the short time that I have been reading this it has been strongly eluded to that Brienne does not view herself as a woman. With Jamie even questioning her as to whether she would prefer to be a guy (a question he doesn't let her answer and immediately berates her for such an idea). If this is George's intent for the character I am not surprised that it was omitted from the show (a part of the audience likely would have lost their shit). But her levels of borderline violent reaction at being called ""wench"", ""my Lady"", and the like make her stick out from any other female character in the show. As someone who is somewhat of a Tomboy myself, she just doesn't strike me as one. She strikes me as transgender instead. However, I will preface this by saying that I have not gotten to Brienne's internal monologue chapters which begin in Feast for Crows. Maybe that will reveal an entirely different internal monologue but at the moment this is what it seems like to me. For Brienne to come out after a fashion in later seasons. Strikes me as something totally that would be totally within her character arc.",asoiaf
"Sorry if this has been discussed before, but it's killing me. 

I'm reading the books for the first time after watching the entire show. When Dany is in the House of the Undying, she wanders past a door and sees, presumably, Rhaegar and Lynna with baby Aegon (aka Jon Snow). Rhaegar looks at her and says something like ""There should be one more. The dragon has three heads."" 

I'm wondering what he's referencing here? Does he count Aegon and Dany as each one head, and imply she must look for one more? What about Viserys or himself? Does this Rhaegar know what has happened in Dany's present timeline? Does this lead some to think that Tyrion, or someone else, is another Targaryen bastard? 

Additionally...is this something that gets solved later in the books? I'm coming at this from a show-viewing standpoint and I don't want to spoil anything for myself but it's really killing me!!",asoiaf
"Robert sanctioned the murder and rape of Elia Martell and her children by not punishing Clegane, Loch, or Tywin. 

Dany sanctions the slaves raping noblewomen to death in front of their children and also refuses to punish anyone guilty of this, seeing it as an excusable evil when one rebels or sacks a city in rebellion. She even has a girl tortured for the crimes of her father. 

What happened to Elia and her children is Robert’s greatest sin, but I think we are supposed to not care when Dany does this. Interesting.",asoiaf

"There are plenty of books out there longer than A Sword of Storms and A Feast for Crows, that get published in single volumes. The Lord of the Rings is a good start, and there are certainly longer books still even just looking at novels. So why do GRRM's publishers strictly limit him to 1500 manuscript pages, even when it means sacrificing the story?

GRRM's vision suffered due to this limit when he had to split AFfC and ADwD like he did, again when he had to publish ADwD without an ending, and I have a strong feeling he's wrestling with it again as we speak, trying to cram TWoW into less than 1500 manuscript pages.

"Finished ADWD recently. Had a lightbulb moment yesterday.

Elia Martell was in love with Arthur Dayne (It's his name she cried when the Lannister men came for her) and cheating. Ashara discovers it. Probably, after the tourney at Harrenhal (though not that it was with her brother, at this point.) As one of Elia's maids-in-waiting, Ashara would've known best how Elia felt about her husband's slight in crowning Lyanna. Which she might've found a bit indifferent for a loving, loyal wife. Which makes her curious and more observant of her mistress' behaviour and activities leading to the discovery.

Ashara, we know, was 'dishonoured' by someone at Harrenhal. My take is she slept with Robert Baratheon. He refuses to marry her, of course. Because he's betrothed to Lyanna, she thinks. She can do nothing but be okay with it. And is. Until she discovers she's pregnant. Days before Robert's wedding to Lyanna. Maybe, he'll marry her if Lyanna is out of the picture. Which she might be if there was an honourable way for Rhaegar to pursue Lyanna. By means of an annulment if he knew his wife to be cheating and the children not his. So Ashara informs Rhaegar of Elia's doings and we know the rest. At some point after this, she learns that the other party is her brother. She kills herself as the mess she instigated ends up killing her brother.

So, young Griff, fair-haired (like Edric Dayne) and purple-eyed(like Ashara Dayne) is Arthur Dayne's son.

This also explains why Rhaegar names Jon Aegon (as we discover in the show) when he already has a son called Aegon who he believes is TPTWP.

No wonder Arthur Dayne is perpetually sad.

Varys, of course, knew all this",asoiaf
"/u/elio_garcia  and Linda discussed the endgame of GoT and what it meant for the books in a [previous video](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/c5uedb/spoilers_extended_westerosorg_on_game_of_thrones/), where they also talked about King Bran. After they posted that video, HBO released this interview with Isaac:

&gt; __HBO: So, the biggest question on our minds: What was your reaction when you found out Bran would become king?__

&gt; __Isaac Hempstead Wright:__ I had to physically get up and walk around my flat. I said, “What?! You’re joking.” It was the very last thing I expected to happen. I was convinced they had sent a script to everyone in which they become king or queen, so I still didn’t believe it until the read-through.

&gt; But I think he is a great character to take on that role. You never thought of him in that way, but what more could you ask for in a king than to have no personal attachments, no agenda, but have a calm understanding of the entire universe? He’s the ideal person to be in charge.

&gt; [Creators] David [Benioff] and Dan [Weiss] told me there were __two things [author] George R.R. Martin had planned for Bran, and that was the Hodor revelation, and that he would be king__. So that’s pretty special to be directly involved in something that is part of George’s vision. It was a really nice way to wrap it up.

Then Elio and Linda made [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50aa3Ahzr9s) to discuss the question of King Bran in more detail as it was apparently coming from GRRM according to this interview. By the way, I added several commentaries in italics.

---

They first question what GRRM might have meant with “Bran will be king” and whether it was Bran as King of Westeros instead of something else. They consider the possibility that GRRM told D&amp;D that Bran would be king beyond the Wall or king on the weirwood throne or king of the children of forest etc. and D&amp;D simplified it in the adaptation by making him the king of Westeros and that information passed on to Isaac. Linda does not find this scenario very likely but Elio still has the feeling that it might be the case.

Then Elio explains what he means. According to him, GRRM might have told D&amp;D that Bran would be king of “something” when D&amp;D visited GRRM at Santa Fe in 2013 and went through every character for a week. Elio points that to be able to discuss King Bran in the books properly; we need to delve into the writing history of ASOIAF and GRRM’s earliest plans. He speculates that Bran as King of Westeros might have initially been in the plans of GRRM at an early point in the writing when he thought “years” would pass within the story.

Linda does not disregard that possibility. Then she repeats the problems from the previous video about the King Bran scenario which were glossed over in the show:

1. How can Bran physically leave the cave in a realistic manner?

1. Being young, crippled, out of the picture for a very long time and having no connections to anyone, how would Bran be accepted as king?

1. Why does Bran agree to or want to be the king of Westeros?

They point that Bran has increasingly fewer chapters in the books (which is why they can forgive the show giving Bran a season off). Elio mentions this strange aspect of the books such that Bran starts as a very prominent POV at the beginning; but in ASoS he gets disconnected from the main story and after that, he has only 3 chapters throughout AFfC and ADwD.

Elio explains some of the details from the writing of ASOIAF. AGoT starts as the first part of a trilogy where initially months can pass within a couple of chapters. But then the action picks up and time gets slower. Failing to finish Act 1 in a single book, GRRM decides to create a new intermediary book. He splits the manuscript and publishes the first part as the AGoT we have, while reserving several hundred MS pages to the newly created book, which is ACoK. After some time he continues the work on ACoK, he hits a massive roadblock. Once again GRRM observes that the momentum of the action does not allow time to pass as fast as he would. This is where he stops all work on ASOIAF and makes detailed structural plans. He creates a new, detailed outline which we have not seen yet. According to this outline, ASOIAF expands to 6 books with a 5 year gap after ASoS. Among other things, this is where they speculate that fake Aegon came into existence. With this new perspective, GRRM does not have much problem in writing ASoS with blazing speed. Then he tries to write the 5 year gap but he can’t make it work. He makes another major revision to his plans and drops the 5 year gap while ASOIAF expands to 7 books in 2001. As a side note, GRRM did not write a single word on Bran throughout 2000-2006 at the very least and perhaps even more years into the writing of ADwD.

Linda raises the point that 5 year gap as an off-screen training montage would work really well for characters like Bran and Arya per GRRM’s own words. But the gap was dropped and there should be serious problems other than the Meereenese Knot that must be causing so much delay in the last few books. Linda wonders whether it is Arya and Bran who are throwing a spanner into GRRM’s plans now for not having the age and training they were supposed to have, to do what they were supposed to do. According to the original plans, we are precisely at the point where Bran and Arya are supposed to do the stuff they were going to do after the 5 year gap. Does GRRM have difficulties in making Arya and Bran do the stuff that he once thought to be done by their 5 year older selves?

Elio considers that possible but he claims that GRRM has accepted that the characters are not going to be as old as he’d initially thought at the end of the story; so, he tried to come up with how to make them work towards the end he wanted, given that they aren't going to be as old and that is the important point. __Bran as king might have been GRRM’s original conception at the beginning but at this point of the writing, he’s moved away from it, or he’s redefined what “king” is for Bran’s endgame.__

In ADwD, Bran meets the three eyed crow on a weirwood throne. Elio speculates that a greenseer king (not of _men_ though) might be the kind of king GRRM has redefined Bran’s role as. As a side note, GRRM created other kinds of kings in TWOIAF, specifically the [Warg King](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Warg_King) and the [First King](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/First_King), which might hold some clues for Bran’s redefined endpoint.

Linda finds in difficult to believe that GRRM would make such a major change but at the same time, she admits that GRRM _did_ change a lot of major things, and introduced new elements like the fake Aegon. On the other hand, if Bran is such a central character to GRRM’s vision for the series, Linda finds it difficult to see GRRM radically changing Bran’s endgame.

Then they talk about prophecies and entertain the idea that prophecies might be more complicated than what most people think. Linda speculates whether Bran might be the third head of the dragon, or Bran might be the Azor Ahai Reborn or one of the three Azor Ahai Reborn figures as Linda’s pick would be Jon, Dany and Bran as three prophesized saviors. As a side note, I have long thought that Bran, Davos and Sam should be three Azor Ahai Reborn figures and Jon should be their Lightbringer.

Then they move onto how GRRM would solve the problems they mentioned earlier about King Bran, starting with the logistics of bringing Bran back. They point that it is very difficult to get to the cave. Maybe a dragon might come and take Bran off but Fire&amp;Blood revealed that dragons might not pass beyond the Wall at all. So, if this kind of thing is to happen, the Wall should have fallen by that time (assuming there is an available dragon that can ferry them back). On his own, can Bran climb to a dragon and can he hold onto it without a saddle (and who will make that saddle)?

---

_Here I disagree with them on the logistics of bringing Bran back. I made a [work on the maps](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9jlyo4/spoilers_extended_movements_beyond_the_wall/) to argue that the cave is not as far north as most readers seem to believe. Jon and Ygritte almost certainly slept in the same cave system, which happens to be real close to the back door of the cave of the children. The wildlings with Jon did not light fire in these caves facing south, for fear of being seen by the watchers on the Wall. Also remember that as Meera noticed at one point while they were going to the cave, Coldhands was leading them through circles for several days. But we know that it was done in order for him to ambush and slay the mutineers from the Craster’s Keep, whose flesh he fed to the party. Neither transportation nor the weather should be a big problem for GRRM. It is not like the weather will continuously be inhospitable for human life throughout winter. The recent snow storm around Winterfell is a rare thing, not the typical Tuesday in the northern winter. Also we should keep in mind that the journey to the cave seemed far more difficult than it should be because Bran-Hodor-Meera-Jojen-Summer-Coldhands was not the ideal ranging party. A group of experienced rangers might cover that distance in less time with fewer difficulties. The only problem is that the cave is besieged by the wights and possibly the Others. But if somehow the ranging party has this intelligence, they might prepare and arm themselves properly. Even without that, the Night’s Watch already knows about dragonglass and they would arm themselves properly for any ranging beyond the Wall. Of course, the return journey is another story. Here, I make use of Gorne’s Way which GRRM introduced in ASoS and expanded in TWOIAF. Delving deep into the caves on the way back allows GRRM to play with the timing of their surfacing up and joining the story where and when GRRM needs them to be. There is nothing in the darkness of the unexplored caves that dictates strict synchronization with other parts of the story and this is a good thing for GRRM._

---

Elio and Linda talk about other ways to bring Bran back. They discuss the Hodor revelation which also comes from GRRM, and whether it might take place at the “back door” of the cave system which we have not seen yet. Linda thinks that it does not necessarily take place there. For some reason, Bran might send Meera-Hodor-Summer south to tell certain people to come to the cave and bring him back. Bran might be in Hodor for most part of this journey and the Hodor thing might happen at the Black Gate of Nightfort. I think this is a logistically sound idea that solves a lot of problems and I can think of many ways to make it work in my TWoW outline. But the greatest question is why Bran will want to leave the cave in the first place, who he will send word to and how he can expect them to agree to help them. Also assuming that Bran sends people, is south the only way?

---

_For example, it is possible to tie this mission to Davos/Skagos storyline. Davos is destined to Skagos to bring Rickon and his direwolf back. If Shaggydog takes a mortal wound while hunting down an enormous unicorn alone (he gets wounded when he brought down a huge one in ADwD), Bran can easily see that and also understands that Davos will have a big problem in his mission. As a result, Bran might decide to send **his** direwolf along with Hodor and Meera so that no one can deny the legitimacy of their claims when they vouch for Davos. The party aims for Eastwatch to find a ship that can carry them to Skagos (assuming Davos is still working on his mission). My guess is that neither the Skagosi nor Osha will find Davos convincing and they will simply put him into jail as it is starting to be a pattern with Davos. He will stay there until Meera arrives and tells them that he is a good man and legit. It is even possible to tie the Hardhome horror into this knot. On the way to Eastwatch, the party comes to Hardhome but the Others have been stalking them since leaving the cave. Thinking that the greenseers must be up to some devious plans, the Others launch their attack to Hardhome prematurely to make sure that the party that had left the cave is slain. Hodor moment might take place at Hardhome at this moment. The Others destroy Hardhome as Mel saw in a vision but the premature attack allows some wildlings to escape the trap and make it to Easwatch through the shores and also through the boats and rafts they have been building as reported in ADwD. At Eastwatch Meera finds a ship destined to Skagos and brings Rickon, Osha and Davos back. Lots of things happen afterwards. Winterfell is liberated and the lords assemble at the Great Hall. They cannot declare Rickon as the Lord of Winterfell because they are all told by Meera that Bran is alive. Lord Manderly promised to join Stannis only when he brought his liege lord back, assuming that Rickon is the one. This is where an experienced and well armed party of rangers are sent to bring Bran back. They will have the motivation and they will know the location. The journey back will probably still take place through Gorne’s Way but this scenario solves a lot of problems in the northern storylines._

---

Next they discuss the problem of how Bran might be accepted as king. They find it very unlikely for Bran to be elected as the king. Elio thinks that an older Bran according to the original plans might have done a lot of visible things to defeat the Others as a “sorcerer lord” and that would have made his campaign for winning the election. But in the story we got, it is very unlikely that Bran would do something that visible in the rest of the story.

They they move onto why Bran would want to be the king in the first place. Linda points that Bloodraven was a kingmaker and he might convince Bran to assume the title. But Elio finds that as a strange thing to have so late into the story. Linda points that this theory relies on side materials (like D&amp;E, TWOIAF etc.) to know Bloodraven and that is not a preferable thing because ASOIAF should be self-reliant and stand on its own. My supporting argument is that the Bloodraven who would do such political manipulations is long dead and the greenseer on that weirwood throne is above such base politics of men. As far as we can see, he is operating on the grandest scheme, and he is only trying to deal with the Others and to do that, he is trying to train Bran before his time is up (and it is implied that his time will be up soon).

Then Elio addresses an important point. We all know that GRRM repeatedly said how he knew the endpoints of major characters since the beginning. One idea is that since the ending is so integral to the overall vision GRRM conceived at the beginning of the saga, he might stick to the ending and completely sideline or ignore structural problems just to have that ending. Elio does not think GRRM would go that far (as in distorting the structure for the sake of the ending he envisioned at the dawn of the story). Elio sees very little in AGoT/ACoK/ASoS that plants the idea of Bran is going to be the king. He knows some early theories for that end but he considers them weak in quotations and structure. AGoT started as the first book of a trilogy but was concluded as the first book of a “four-book trilogy”. ACoK started as the second book of a four-book trilogy but was concluded as the second book of a heptology with ASoS as the third book. In short, one would expect to see a lot of King Bran setup in these first three books because they were meant to cover a lot of space in the overall span of story.

Linda discusses the example of Ned’s death on the subject of subverting expectations. You need to build expectations in the first place and then the subversion should not feel out of the left field in the setting of the story. Ned’s death was shocking to the readers but for an objective eye, it could not have been any different. He was honorable/merciful to a fault, he did not know nor liked the game of thrones and he found himself trapped within the plots of master players. The in-world context is perfectly reasonable for Ned’s shocking death. King Bran might be meant as a shock to the readers but its in-world context should be comparably reasonable.

---

_This is the crux of the matter for the people who have problems with King Bran as it is portrayed in the show. I cannot see how the in-world context might make sense for King Bran in the books. Regardless of what GRRM supposedly said, I personally do not see King Bran happening based on the books I read so far and I refuse to believe that GRRM will build (or is capable of building) a reasonable in-world context for that within the next two books. People who defend King Bran goes by the argument that the current books have the necessary context that makes sense for that end (which I will never agree with) or they simply believe that GRRM will do the necessary setup in the next books (which I refuse to believe before I see those books). I don't care if I am called to be in denial for not buying something that does not currently make sense nor does it seem likely to make sense in the next books._

---

Then Linda explains her “loony theory” that has been teased from the start of the video. It ends up being one of those body snatcher theories. GRRM loves his body snatchers as we know from his other works. The basic premise is to solve all the problems they mentioned before with King Bran (like logistics) and still stick to GRRM’s supposedly original conception of King Bran. Being king but not in his own body works well for the King Bran endgame and that might explain why D&amp;D did not do that in the show. Elio recalls the body snatcher theory with Jon’s body but they dismiss that idea because that does not feel like Jon’s story. The host body in their theory is Euron. Lucky me!

They mention a lot of usual things from the Eldritch Apocalypse stuff but they differ from all that by claiming that Euron’s mind will be destroyed but his body will end up fine just like the vegetable Drogo after the ritual. Euron’s empty shell will be the perfect ride for Bran to actually stay in the cave but be the king of Westeros. 

I am not going to dwell on this theory further. In the rest of the video, they answer questions from fans.",asoiaf
"As the Game of Thrones sadly fizzled out in a surprisingly intact Small Council chamber, Grandmaester(?)
Sam presented Archmaester Ebrose's *A Song of Ice and Fire* which chronicles the wars and events that followed the death of King Robert Baratheon.

Of course in groan inducing fashion, D&amp;D get one last gut-buster in as we learn that Archmaester Ebrose makes no mention of Tyrion Lannister  throughout his comprehensive treatment of ""modern"" history.

As a joke it was shit

In-universe, it turns *A Song of Ice and Fire* into the Where’s Waldo of historical scholarship. 

Despite a plethora of contemporary sources, documents and only detailing events that have all happened within the last few years the omission of Tyrion Lannister means Archmaester Ebrose's work is critically incompetent.

When you remove Tyrion Lannister from the work and events it covers it raises questions like:

- Who designed the Handicapable saddle for King Bran the Broken?
- Who did Catelyn Stark take prisoner to the Eyrie?
- Who did Lysa Arryn &amp; Lord Robin Arryn imprison and hold a trial by combat for?
- **Why did Ser Gregor Clegane start raiding the Riverlands?** 
- Why did Ser Jaime Lannister break Ned Stark's leg and kill his house guards?
- Why were the forces of the Westerlands mobilized for war immediately after the death of King Robert Baratheon?
- Who brought the Mountain Clans of the Vale into the Westerlands forces?
- **Who brought Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, current Master of Coin &amp; Lord of Highgarden, into Kings Landing and Court?**	
- Who sent Myrcella to Dorne?
- **Who was King Joffrey ~~Baratheon~~ Lannister's Hand before Lord Tywin?**
- Who prepared the defense of King's Landing against Lord Stannis Baratheon?
- **Who devised the Wildfire plan during the Battle of the Black Water?**
- Who married Queen of the North Sansa Stark when she was a hostage in Kings Landing?
- **Who was accused of the regicide of King Joffrey ~~Baratheon~~ Lannister?**
- **Who was put on trial for the regicide of King Joffrey ~~Baratheon~~ Lannister?**
- **Who was important enough for Prince Oberyn of Dorne to be Champion for in a Trial by Combat for the Regicide of King Joffrey?**
- **Who Killed Tywin Lannister?**
- Who was Dany Targaryen's chief adviser?
- Who thought up the Wights Moot?
- Who let the Kingslayer go?
- Who suggested the radical changes to how kings are chosen?
- **Who nominated King Bran the Broken?**

Fact is, omitting Tyrion from the events of recent history is impossible because he shows up a lot and does a number of things that are important or have significant consequences? 

I imagine reading the Game of Thrones version of *A Song of Ice and Fire* would be annoying as fuck with the obvious gaps in information indicating that there are figures missing from the work

And here's why this shitty sitcom joke is unintentionally brilliant . 

**D&amp;D presented us A Song of Ice and Fire that has most of the big events, pivotal moments and gets general gist right but sacrifices some essential bits for a cheap payoff**

Intentional or not (Definitely not), that single shit joke summarizes the core differences between HBO's Game of Thrones and GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire. From every problem and flaw we see with the show, it all comes down to D&amp;D sacrificing depth, nuance, consistent and coherent character development, writing, themes in exchange for a quick razzle dazzle spectacle. 

**Even their own in-universe version of *A Song of Ice and Fire* is a reflection of their approach to the show and deviation from GRRM.**",asoiaf

"It's well known that A Feast for Crows, even after GRRM had decided he needed to write it at all, grew in the writing until it didn't even fit into two books in the end.

Would it have been possible to write a tighter version of these books without sacrificing any other the information we were given or the atmosphere of the stories - say by combining these two Brienne chapters together, these three Sam chapters into two, these two Dany chapters into one - or do you think that every chapter adds something unique and can't be reduced/needs to stand alone?",asoiaf
"This has nothing to do with the show. I want to know there is any character that you strongly dislike in the books. And I don't mean love to hate characters like Joffrey and Ramsay, I mean that you don't think that the character is good. 
This is pretty hard because GRRM has made me enjoy nearly every character, but one that I don't like is Penny. I think she is irritating and doesn't fit in the story and her only use is so Tyrion gets a purpose when he becomes a slave.

"Hi, everyone! I recently started reading A Game of Thrones and I am absolutely loving it. I am halfway done with the first book and i have been reading nonstop. I never watched the show and I tried my best to avoid spoilers for the show/books because I knew I would eventually want to get into the series. One problem that I’ve encountered while reading the book is, I sometime forget who certain characters are lol. There’s been a lot of characters thrown at me and I find myself not remembering a lot of them, especially the ones I thought would be minor characters which end up being recurring characters. Once I tried looking a character up just to refresh myself on who they were/their significance and the first google search result showed me their death.

"Some people here have recently been going through the 5 published books to find foreshadowing for King Bran or Jon's banishment to the Wall. The most mentioned passages have been [Cat's request for Bran to tell his story to a Great Council that will choose a new King](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/c40n17/spoilers_main_grrms_ending_for_bran_foreshadowed/), and  the [numerous parallels](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/c3rujr/spoilers_extended_aegon_targaryen_kneeling_to/ert12a6/) between the Bran/Jon exile and Aegon V/Bloodraven exile. During a reread I stumbled on a AGOT chapter, when Jeor tries to convince a conflicted Jon to accept the Mormont sword Longclaw. Jon is reluctant and thinks to himself. His mind drifts: 

&gt; When Jon had been Bran's age, he had dreamed of doing great deeds, as boys always did. The details of his feats changed with every dreaming, but quite often he imagined saving his father's life. Afterward Lord Eddard would declare that Jon had proved himself a true Stark, and place Ice in his hand. Even then he had known it was only a child's folly; no bastard could ever hope to wield a father's sword. Even the memory shamed him. **What kind of man stole his own brother's birthright?**

If ADOS has the same broad character endings as the show, then this thought of Jon's would be inverted. Rather than Jon depriving a trueborn Stark sibling, his brother Bran will indirectly steal *his* birthright. Jon would be heir to the Throne under the Targaryen succession line. But when the Great Council is convened, the lords will instead choose Bran who will (reluctantly) sentence Jon to the Wall for murdering Dany. 

Of course, it's quite possible I'm reading too much into this. Perhaps this line is simply foreshadowing Jon's temporary stint as King in the North after his resurrection, or even Renly's usurpation of Stannis. But considering how GRRM has said he's known the main characters' [**endings**](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/c77e1o/spoilers_main_at_balticon_2016_grrm_said_that_he/) for decades (even if their [*journeys*](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6nq2ti/main_spoilers_original_3page_outline_by_george_rr/) have radically changed as he wrote), it's possible that Jon's question is predicting his ignominious fate.",asoiaf
"The fourth son of a fourth son, who was a squire to a hedge knight, ascended to the Iron Throne. Aegon V had to deal with Blackfyre Rebellions and revolts throughout his reign.

"The reasons are as follows:

1) Legendary artifacts are kind of Euron's favorite thing. He has a set of Valyrian steel armor and Dragonbinder, he may have had a dragon egg at one point, and he's probably about to acquire the Horn of Joramun and glass candles from Oldtown. He's a pirate first and foremost, and what's a pirate without treasure?

2) Dawn is *the* legendary sword of Westeros, if not the world. Made from a stone that fell from the sky. As strong and sharp as Valyrian steel, but made from a completely different metal. Probably dating back all the way to the Long Night and named appropriately. A sword worthy of Euron's armor.

3) Dawn is at Starfall, by word of GRRM:

&gt;Dawn remains at Starfall, until another Sword of the Morning shall arise.

It may not be in the castle itself. Ashara Dayne might have taken it with her when she committed suicide by jumping from the Palestone Tower into the Torrentine River. But a little water is hardly going to stop Euron from finding it.

4) Starfall is fairly close to Euron's primary target of Oldtown, sitting near the westernmost edge of Dorne. It sits on an isle in the middle of the mouth of the Torrentine River, and will be quite accessible to ironborn longships. Much less a dragon if Euron binds one.

5) It is also rather close to one of Euron's secondary targets, Horn Hill, on the other side of the Red Mountains. The wooded surroundings of Horn Hill may be the burning forest from Aeron's dream, and Gilly has taken Mance Rayder and Val's son there. He may have significance for one of Euron's blood rituals.

6) A visit by Euron to Starfall will allow GRRM to tie off a loose end, Dorne's resident edgelord, Darkstar, as well as Ser Balon Swann, Obara, and Areo who have been sent after him. Perhaps Ser Harras Harlaw and the Valyrian steel sword Nightfall will be involved?

7) By claiming Dawn, Euron will be able to strengthen his claim to being Azor Ahai reborn. Many theories suggest that Euron may play the role of ""false messiah,"" and/or team up with Melisandre. Dawn, as the most thematically appropriate base for Lightbringer, would do much to strengthen his claim and convince Melisandre and others to join him.

8) Euron's Valyrian steel armor, the sword Dawn, and the bound dragon Rhaegal create a convenient package of legendary artifacts for the real Azor Ahai, probably Jon, to acquire either after Euron's death, or, in one theory I consider kind of tinfoily, through possessing Euron's body. All Euron has to do is deliver them to the North in order to set up the most epic loot drop in the history of Westeros.

9) Euron acquiring the artifacts and dragon that Jon will use, assuming Jon and Daenerys have a relationship in the books, explains how Euron is so confident he will be able to wed Daenerys. Euron most likely saw a figure using those artifacts through his captive warlocks, shade-of-the-evening dreams, greensight, or whatever, who also was in a relationship with Daenerys. He concluded it was him, when in reality it will be Jon.",asoiaf
"

My theory is the descendants of the Marsh King still exist in Westeros through the male line. 

We are told by Bran “His son was Rickard Stark, not my father's father but another Rickard, he took the Neck away from the Marsh King and married his daughter.”

We do not what happen to any sons or brothers of the Marsh King or his people. Rather than become vassals of Winterfell or be extinguished like ,House Greenwood, House Towers, House Amber, and House Frost. Relocating and remaining independent, would more attractive than serving their rivals. 

When the Starks drove the Blackwoods from the Wolf’s wood. The Blackwoods relocated to the Riverlands and kept the Old Gods. The same is true for the Manderleys , who kept the seven and the title Order of the Greenhand . Which is a Knightly order founded by House Gardener. The Orphans of the greenblood who fled from Essos , but refused to assimilate to Dornish culture, by retaining their Rhoynish heritage and language.
All being displaced groups. 

So from those examples, we’d be looking for a people that stand out from the crowd. 

The best candidates in my opinion are the Thenns. They wear bronze armour, when most free folk wear furs and leather. The Thenns forge their own helms , axe and spear heads, were as the free folk use stone and wood. With the exception of weapons taken from dead rangers and raided from south of the Wall. 

""Aye, my lady. The Thenns have lords and laws."" They know how to kneel. ""They mine tin and copper for bronze, forge their own arms and armor instead of stealing it. A proud folk, and brave. Mance Rayder had to best the old Magnar thrice before Styr would accept him as King-Beyond-the-Wall.""

Magnar we are told means Lord in old tongue, but also has connections with King. 
Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg is also referred to as King of the Giants.  

Jon . ""It was Mag the Mighty. The king of the giants.""

House Magnar of Kingshouse is a noble house from Kingshouse on the island of Skagos


Thenn is also area beyond the Wall where the Thenns live. 

The most compelling link is George’s love of homophones. 

Reyne/rain/reign/rein 
Dorne/Dawn
Profit/prophet 
Pray/prey
Morning/mourning 
Thenn/Fen

A Fen is a a low and marshy or frequently flooded area of land.

"In the books the Eyrie is a smaller castle on the top of a mountain with a dangerous path up traversable by mule and basically only during summer, with a larger castle towards the bottom (Moon Gate) that is the main residence.

In the show its a gigantic fantasy castle on the top of this huge unrealistic and silly looking stone arch (or hollow stone stool, depending on season), and almost as big as the mountain itself.

"I made a comment in another thread about a realization I had regarding as to how Bran can become King. The idea is short, based mostly on how the books will handle it and actually makes sense contrary to the show version where he is chosen for having the best story.

&amp;#x200B;

***Bran will be chosen as king / be required to be king because he is the one who defeats the Others***.

&amp;#x200B;

Unlike the show, the Others in the books will not suddenly be defeated because some ninja assassin accidentally unplugs the super computer that is controlling them. They will be defeated by either a very costly war in which Bran will be incredibly instrumental due to information that only someone deeply rooted in magic can acquire or the Others will agree to a peace treaty in which, also Bran, is the main component in communicating with them and making sure the people of Westeros abide by it.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if the Others are controlled by the Children of the Forest who are just trying to fight back from being extinct, the idea in place still works as Bran will still be the most important figure in both scenarios.  

&amp;#x200B;

If the Others are defeated by war, Bran may be chosen as king by the lords of Westeros for leading them to victory by providing important information, scouting, even having a psychic battle which helped win the war. 

&amp;#x200B;

If the Others agree to peace, it may be that Bran is the one who will broker it and not Jon. Bran will be able to communicate with the CoTF, if they are controlling the Others, or find out the details of the original peace agreement that happened after the first Long Night and come to an understanding with the Others that way. The lords will then chose Bran as king for saving the rest of humanity or part of the treaty might be that Bran must be king of Westeros in order to maintain the peace and act as a bridge between the 2 sides.

"A while ago, I posted a theory which suggesting that the apparent history of infertility, stillbirths, infant deaths and women dying in the birthing bed that seems to have plagued the main branch of House Arryn, was caused by Alyssa's Curse.

&gt;Alyssa Arryn had seen her husband, her brothers, and all her children slain, and yet in life she had never shed a tear. So in death, the gods had decreed that she would know no rest until her weeping watered the black earth of the Vale, where the men she had loved were buried. Alyssa had been dead six thousand years now, and still no drop of the torrent had ever reached the valley floor far below. A Game of Thrones  Catelyn VII


[Original theory](https://old.reddit.com/r/pureasoiaf/comments/74ir9v/noticed_something_else_about_the_vale/) 


TL,DR  The landmarks and layout of the Vale represent male and female reproductive systems - The Bloody Gate's twin watchtowers joined by a covered bridge over the mountain road representing a woman's overies and the fertile Vale representing the womb.

The Giants Lance represents the male with the waterfall known as Alyssa's Tears flowing from the mountain top never reaching(fertilizing) the Vale(womb) below.


The [Extended theory](https://swordsoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2018/08/male-and-female-in-vale-of-arryn.html) goes a lot deeper into the other landmarks like the waycastles, the Eyrie and the Moon Door.

The chapters that take place in the Vale and the Eyrie are some of my favourite and every time i read them  I notice something new that (IMO) adds to this theory. On my latest re-read i was looking at Tyrion's Trial by combat when i noticed something else.

When the champions- Bronn and ser Vardis Egan fight, ser Vardids fights with a sword that Lysa Arryn gave him,

&gt;Ser Vardis held out a gauntleted hand, and his squire placed a handsome double-edged longsword in his grasp. The blade was engraved with a delicate silver tracery of a mountain sky; its pommel was a falcon's head, its crossguard fashioned into the shape of wings. ""I had that sword crafted for Jon in King's Landing,"" Lysa told her guests proudly as they watched Ser Vardis try a practice cut. ""He wore it whenever he sat the Iron Throne in King Robert's place. Isn't it a lovely thing? I thought it only fitting that our champion avenge Jon with his own blade.""
The engraved silver blade was beautiful beyond a doubt, but it seemed to Catelyn that Ser Vardis might have been more comfortable with his own sword. Yet she said nothing; she was weary of futile arguments with her sister. A Game of Thrones  Catelyn VII



The sword is often a phallic symbol and this one is Jon Arryn's sword.


The champions fight below a statue of Alyssa Arryn,

&gt;A bell tolled loudly below them. High lords and serving girls alike broke off what they were doing and moved to the balustrade. Below, two guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks led forth Tyrion Lannister. The Eyrie's plump septon escorted him to the statue in the center of the garden, a weeping woman carved in veined white marble, no doubt meant to be Alyssa.

Bronn is well on the way to beating ser Vardis but Jon Arryn's sword and the statue of Alyssa Arryn play a big part in the knight's death,

&gt;Throwing aside his shield, Ser Vardis lurched after him, using both hands to raise his sword. His right arm was blood from elbow to fingers now, yet his last desperate blow would have opened Bronn from neck to navel … if the sellsword had stood to receive it. But Bronn jerked back. Jon Arryn's beautiful engraved silver sword glanced off the marble elbow of the weeping woman and snapped clean a third of the way up the blade. Bronn put his shoulder into the statue's back. The weathered likeness of Alyssa Arryn tottered and fell with a great crash, and Ser Vardis Egen went down beneath her. Bronn was on him in a heartbeat, kicking what was left of his shattered rondel aside to expose the weak spot between arm and breastplate. Ser Vardis was lying on his side, pinned beneath the broken torso of the weeping woman. Catelyn heard the knight groan as the sellsword lifted his blade with both hands and drove it down and in with all his weight behind it, under the arm and through the ribs. Ser Vardis Egen shuddered and lay still.

Alyssa's curse indeed.",asoiaf

As Castamere shares the same root as Castle. Know who else owns a Castle? The Lannister’s

Now another reference to the Lannister’s comes when in the Storm of Swords epilogue it is mentioned that the Freys lost in total 50 men. Now I want you to remember that number. For you know something that also has the number 5 in it. That’s right Harrenhal.

People justifiably complain about how they handled Danaerys, but I always suspected she might die never taking the throne, her and others sacrificing themselves to save the realm as a whole would have been both a far more valiant end, as well as thematically appropriate with the the thesis that a lot of the kingdoms problems are born from people being more concerned with grabbing and holding power than using it responsibly.",asoiaf

To begin, when I say ""ignorance"" I don't mean it in the pejorative sense; I just mean characters who don't know things. And I'm talking about a specific sort of knowledge they lack, which is knowledge about the world. Obviously secrets, misinformation, and simply the pace that news travels at is a big part of the story, but this is focusing on characters simply knowing about their world. When characters have limited knowledge about the world, it makes the world feel bigger.

The first time I noticed this was on my second read, as Catelyn approaches the Eyrie with Tyrion as her prisoner:

&gt;When her uncle saw that she had stopped, he moved his horse closer and pointed. ""It's there, beside Alyssa's Tears. All you can see from here is a flash of white every now and then, if you look hard and the sun hits the walls just right.""

&gt;Seven towers, Ned had told her, like white daggers thrust into the belly of the sky, so high you can stand on the parapets and look down on the clouds. ""How long a ride?"" she asked.

Catelyn had never seen the Eyrie before this moment, only knowing a description of it from Ned. But why does this matter? Partly, it's a convenient mechanism for a writer. A character who doesn't know something serves as an excuse to have information presented. A character returning to a place they see all the time doesn't spend time drinking in the details -- try to remember your last commute to work. A character who can see thing fresh or ask questions is as much a staple in writing as are paragraph breaks and full stops; even more true in fantasy and scifi. But, that'd delivering the world to the reader; I believe these moments of ignorance are actually part of the actual world building.

**Bricks and Mortar**

Catelyn remembering Ned describing the Eyrie is such a minor detail, but it's these minor things, one stacked on top of the next, that build the World of Ice and Fire.  Some details are the bricks in the structure GRRM is creating, but I think these moments of characters not knowing everything about their world are more like the mortar holding the bricks together.

Part of world building is coming up with lots of cool ideas, lightsabers, face dancers, giant eagles, and flying broom sports. But, part of it is also making that world feel real and lived in. In the real world, people don't have encyclopedic knowledge. Unless you're from a one stoplight town or are a taxi driver in London, you don't even know all the streets in the city where you live. Having varying bodies of knowledge among the characters makes the world feel big and rich, and its inhabitants feel real.

We get these details-of-ignorance all throughout the series. Arya doesn't know how far the God's Eye is from Riverrun. Black Lorren doesn't know what the Dothraki are. Brynden the Blackfish is shocked to learn just what Moat Cailin looks like. The rather well traveled Jorah Mormont knows there's cities to the East of the Red Waste, but not what they are or how far away. It's possible that there's no person in Westeros outside of the Citadel that knows the Dosh Khaleen exist.

The more people don't know things (when they're not mere idiots) the more we're reminded just how much there is to know. If it feels like most of the characters have seen the world, then it won't feel like a very big world.

"I don't know if I should title this like a discussion or a short essay, but none the less, long post coming with spoilers for EVERYTHING, SHOW AND BOOKS.

And sorry if my grammar is a disaster, my english comes from hours on the internet reading things like the one I'm about to put your through.

Let's get into it.

In the aftermath of the show's finale my mind wandered a lot about how the plot in the books is gonna pan out, and the one thing that I personally haven't saw being discussed is how the winter is going to hit the book plot, based on all we know that has happened and all that's going to happen... Because yes, we know that Bran is going to sit on that ugly chair or the replacement of the Iron Throne after Dany raze the capital, either intentionally or by accident, the ""How's"" and the ""What's"" of this things are not a priority for the moment, because I want to figure out the ""How's"" of how George is going to get there, if that makes sense.

I want to start where the cold is hitting first, North of the Wall, were we assume that the biggest concentrations of people are in one of two places, in Hardhome or down in the Wall with the black brothers, and this second group (that is the less impressive but is the one I'm going to focus on) represents one of the biggest problems that the winter is going to present to our charaters, the refugees...

The situation at Castle Black is dire, the cultural gap the animosity between both sides of the Wall that has been brewing for centurys and the shortage of food and space explodes into the riot that puts an end to the Lord Commander's short life and his rule over the Night's Watch, figure that tried to close this gap and brought the widlings into the realm. All of this is a really important factor because I count that this refugee crisis is going to replicate south with the advance of the cold on the major Castles, and I'm leaving the Others outside this equation for now because down south, on of the major issues for this conflict is absent, there is no breach between the peoples of the north...

The rulers are going to struggle to stock up on supplys, the crops are going to gi yield less or completely fail and receiving goods is going to be hard when the road dissapear under the snows or worse, the horses and the man die on it, we are already seeing this in Stannis's camp. Later they will have to deal with all the people that can reach their castles or let them die outside their walls, the ones that doesn't die will continue further south. This coupled with the Battle at Winterfell that involves some of the major military powers in the North, makes me think that they will not withstand the coming of the the Others. It would be very hard to maintain control over their territory because travelling is already hard now in the books and I don't think that the sacrifice of a little child is going to stop that

Hardhome is a complete riddle to me right now, the short message sent to Jon makes me think that, unlike the show, the water and the coastlines of Westeros are not going to be so safe from the wights, that includes the Iron Islands, Bear Isle and Skagos, that maybe means something for Davos and Rickon's posse.

I think I should stop right here for now, because the refugee train is going down south babe! The is if they can go through the Neck that is, and because in the South the problem is going to be related to the economy in this winter and I would need more time to get that into paper.

I'd like to know what you think of how the climate/politics/culture is going to affect the plot and maybe if you liked this consideration on what the Winds will bring, let me know and I will continue with a sequel.",asoiaf

" So in the show Varys says ""... who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was."". But what was wrong with Roberts reign? He has said multiple times that he serves the realm and his true allegiance is to the smallfolk, but how did Robert's reign hurt them at all? Sure the crown was in a massive amount of debt and most of it was from Roberts vassal Tywin, so there wasn't a huge risk of war over it. The realm was at peace and the people were safe, so why would he try to restore the Targaryens? The last Targaryen king went crazy and started burning people alive which eventually lead to Roberts Rebellion, which was an incredibly destructive war and hurt the smallfolk a lot. Why would Varys risk having another Targaryen ruler? He also knew that the WotFKs was imminent from his discussion with Illyrio. But did nothing to stop it even with it being very destructive to the smallfolk. He also tried to bring Khal Drogo's khallasar to Westeros to back Viserys's claim to the throne. Wouldn't 40k dothraki riders be insanely destructive to the country? They would rape and pillage anyone not behind a stone wall as Robert said in season one. How is this a better alternative to a fat drunk king, especially when Varys has a powerful position at court that he can use to manipulate the realm to prosperity?",asoiaf
"The ""conventional wisdom"" proposed in AWOIAF is that Rhaegar secretly bankrolled the Tourney of Harrenhal on behalf of House Whent to gather the lords of the realm together to discuss how to get rid of Aerys, but that seems implausible. 

First of all, it's really bad writing to propose a mystery and then provide the answer in the next sentence. Usually if AWOIAF brings up a theory that's probably mostly correct, it will be dismissed in the next sentence. See ""fire wyrms + wyverns = dragons"" or ""Ironborn are from west of Westeros.""

Second, Rhaegar probably didn't have much money besides his royal pension for personal needs. Dragonstone is a pretty poor holding in terms of actual productivity. And that much money disappearing from the royal treasury would be noticed. Plus, supposedly when Robert won the rebellion the treasury was pretty full.

Tywin on the other hand, is the wealthiest man in the Seven Kingdoms and could definitely pay for the tournament. He was the most notable absence from the tournament, meaning no one would have reason to suspect him. Which is probably what a ""shadow host"" would want. And he may have been intimately involved in Rhaegar's possible plans to depose the king. *Or* he may have wanted people to think Rhaegar was trying to overthrow Aerys so he would be disinherited, and Tywin could perhaps wed Cersei to Viserys.",asoiaf
"I've always been a proponent of rereads because it allows you to catch more things that you haven't read AND comprehended on the first time through.

In this post, I'm specifically referring to Meleys and Vhagar. If you recall in Fire and Blood, the relationship between Baelon and Alyssa was probably the most passionate and love filled of most of the targaryans that I've come across. Their relationship also had the least amount of unnatural difficulties. If not for Alyssa's ultimate death, I think they would have been as close and passionate about one another as Jaehaerys and Alysanne.

One of Alyssa's favorite passtimes was riding, first, her spring prince, second her dragon Meleys. The archmaesters make mention that Baelon and Alyssa often went flying together. I presume that during their flying they would land in odd places around westeros spending time together. Their dragons would spend time together as well. Baelon mounting none other than the nightly Vhagar. I always thought of the intelligence of the dragons as something more than dogs but not quite enough to truly articulate their feelings with tongue. This mainly comes from only accepting one rider, emoting similar to their masters even when they're not present, and knowing one another (silverwings reaction to vermithors death).

It wasnt until the third read through that I realized what takes place at rooks rest. Sure I understand that Vhagar was ridden by Aemond while Meleys was ridden by Rhaenys. Imagine that these two, having flown together and spent time together, know one another and are being commanded by their riders to kill one another. I don't know. It just resonates with me that two magnificent beast who had such wondering history together, end up on opposite sides of a fight. And I'm willing to bet that based on the description of the fight, Melys tore into Sunfire and Vhagar tore Meleys to shreds.

# 4- Dark, dark were the tunnels

&amp;#x200B;

Note : All quotes in this section are taken from the short story.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« If anything survived, it was underground. That’s where we should look. » 

	

Dark, Dark were the tunnels is the title of a short story written by GRRM in 1971, in which he tells about Greel, a scout on a mission for the People. 

It is a creature of vaguely human form, small, barely over four feet tall, with large pale eyes. Armed with his spear, he explores the narrow, dark tunnels below the Earth's surface, dreaming that taletellers would sing of his future heroic achievements. Greel has a mental brother, a great blind rat who has been with him since birth, and whom he can control to hear and feel through him. 

Yes, the members of the People have powers. They can mingle their minds with those of other living beings. Yet, despite appearances, they are humans.

Indeed, very quickly the reader understands that several centuries ago, a cataclysmic event caused humans to disappear from the Earth's surface, and separated the survivors into two groups.

The first ones left the planet and witnessed the events from a long distance, without being affected. 

The latter must have hide into the depths of the Earth, where they returned to a primitive stage and survived under extreme conditions.... Finally, only the best adapted ones survived. Thus, slowly, the human species has evolved physically, adapting to this new environment. Their size and build have decreased due to the small size of the tunnels. Deprived of light, their eyes developed, and their skin paled. 

The short story tells **the encounter between the People and the first men** to return to Earth. 

Will they be able to see beyond appearances and understand that they are not so different?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sci-fi short story or fantasy novel, if the genre is different, the main themes developed by GRRM in both stories are essentially the same.

Here are a few examples.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« The tunnels. The dark. For long centuries only the dark. »

&amp;#x200B;

What would happen to mankind if it were plunged into darkness? A theme that inevitably evokes the Long Night, and which has obviously fascinated GRRM for a long time. 

Here he gives an ambiguous answer to this question, by contrasting a return to the primitive state and a real psychological evolution of our species. For the members of the People, normal humans are lower animals with crippled minds. 

We find this same dynamic in ASOIAF, the CotF seeing humans as... children!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« Don’t you understand? This is old. It’s history. It’s the remains of a civilization and a nation and a planet that perished. »

&amp;#x200B;

The apocalypse is both the main theme and the issue of the short story: civilizations have disappeared, and the human species is threatened with extinction.

The concept of the apocalypse, an event that destroys an entire civilization by its scale, is a recurring theme in ASOIAF. We immediately think of the Doom of Valyria, as well as all the places that seem to bear the traces of past cataclysms, but also of all these even older and more mysterious ruins, which seem to be the traces of disappeared civilizations. 

The central point of the story itself, the arrival of the Others, inscribed in the prologue to the very first novel, immediately raises the issue : it is the human species that is in danger of disappearing.

In reality, what interests GRRM is not so much the apocalypse itself as what happens to the survivors and their descendants, including several centuries or thousands of years later... or even more.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« Man must meet man. » 

&amp;#x200B;

The encounter of two very different worlds, which go to war despite the greater threat they face, and which risk disappearing together if they do not succeed in allying... Does that recall something ? 

What would happen if today's humans met their very distant descendants? Could they understand each other? This is the big question this short story raises, and it is the one we are discussing here, because GRRM is asking it again in ASOIAF, without revealing this time the origin of the mysterious people with whom humans are confronted.

	

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« He concentrated on the scent. It was strange, unlike anything he had encountered before. But somehow it felt like a man-scent, though it could not be that. »

&amp;#x200B;

In a few pages, GRRM was already addressing many of his favourite themes in 1971. I do not reveal any more, but this short story also tells about  ice and fire, light and darkness, survival and madness, desire and duty, impregnation and death, and, of course, inbreeding.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« - Down here, in these tunnels, are the answers we’re seeking.   
&gt;  
&gt;\- That’s *your* theory, anyway. »

&amp;#x200B;

All this to say that it is not impossible that GRRM, fascinated by the same themes for a long time, may take up some of its old stories and tell them again, but in another form, in another setting, by turning certain concepts upside down, playing with them and making them more complex... 

He may have draw inspiration from the People of Greel to create the CotF.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Selected short quotes from Dark, Dark were the tunnels :

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« Greel was a strong mind-mingler. He knew the coarse, dim feel of an animal’s mind, the obscene shadows that were the thoughts of the worm-things. And he knew the minds of men. »  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;« He doesn’t realize how deep the cities had dug before the war. There are miles of tunnels under our feet. Level after level. That’s where the survivors would be, if there are any survivors. »

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« Greel thought. An almost man-scent. And words. Could it be that the fire things were men? They would be strange men, much unlike the People. But the taletellers sung of men in ancient times that had strange powers and forms. Might not these be such men? Here, in the Oldest Tunnels, where the legends said the Old Ones had created the People - might not such men still dwell here? »

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« The People fought back. Mind-minglers could sense the worm-things, and spears could slay them, and the great hunting rats could rip them to shreds. But always the worm-things fled back into the earth itself. And there were many worm-things, and few People. »

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« Through him Greel watched : watched with the rat’s ears and with his nose.   
&gt;  
&gt;The fire was talking. »

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; « They were men. Men like the Old Ones. They would help the People against the worm-things. A new age would dawn. »

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# General conclusion 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« The child smiled. ""Men, they are the children."" »  
&gt;  
&gt;ADWD - Bran II

	

What really defines the CotF is their humanity.  Their smiles. Their sadness....

They *are* humans. Their appearance is only a consequence of their history. 

&amp;#x200B;

How does this twist serve the story ? Of course, it is a matter of playing with our expectations to surprise us. The author has done everything possible to ensure that, upon discovering the CotF, the reader immediately imagines supernatural beings, creatures such as wood elves or pixies, or nature spirits. But to say that GRRM plays with tropes has become a trope in itself.  

&amp;#x200B;

If the author preferred to imagine another Humanity, it is to put ours in perspective. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the protagonists, the CotF are part of a vanished world. Yet, from our perspective as readers, they could be our descendants. Our children's children's children.

This is GRRM's tour de force: to present, through beings of the past, a future for Mankind.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, the theme of the story is not simply an allegory of the opposition between man and nature, this great classic of fantasy literature that everyone expects. 

The real point of the encounter between the CotF and the First Men is mankind in conflict with itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

The human being, in all its forms and complexity, is truly at the heart of ASOIAF.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, GRRM could have directly revealed the nature and the origin of the CotF, but he only gives us enough clues to understand by ourselves. However, it is all about making it a secret and not revealing it to the reader. Thus he questions us on wether or not we are able to see humanity inside strangeness.

	

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for having taken the time to read this text !

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

One last thing: unlike humans, who have forgotten where they come from, the CotF know the secret of their origins...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« I am only a boy who dreams. The greenseers were more than that. They were wargs as well, and the greatest of them could wear the skins of any beast that flies or swims or crawls, and could look through the eyes of the weirwoods as well, and see the truth that lies beneath the world. »

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« The way the shadows shifted made it seem as if the walls were moving too. Bran saw great white snakes slithering in and out of the earth around him, and his heart thumped in fear. He wondered if they had blundered into a nest of milk snakes or giant grave worms, soft and pale and squishy. Grave worms have teeth. »

&gt;« Under the hill they still had food to eat. A hundred kinds of mushrooms grew down here. Blind white fish swam in the black river, but they tasted just as good as fish with eyes once you cooked them up. They had cheese and milk from the goats that shared the caves with the singers, even some oats and barleycorn and dried fruit laid by during the long summer. And almost every day they ate blood stew, thickened with barley and onions and chunks of meat. Jojen thought it might be squirrel meat, and Meera said that it was rat. Bran did not care. It was meat and it was good. The stewing made it tender. »

&gt;  
&gt;	Arya rolled headfirst into the tunnel and dropped five feet. She got dirt in her mouth but she didn't care, the taste was fine, the taste was mud and water and worms and life. Under the earth the air was cool and dark. Above was nothing but blood and roaring red and choking smoke and the screams of dying horses. She moved her belt around so Needle would not be in her way, and began to crawl. A dozen feet down the tunnel she heard the sound, like the roar of some monstrous beast, and a cloud of hot smoke and black dust came billowing up behind her, smelling of hell. Arya held her breath and kissed the mud on the floor of the tunnel and cried. For whom, she could not say. »

&gt;	« The ashes fell like a soft grey snow.  
&gt;  
&gt;	Beyond the open fields he could see the great piles of man-rock stark against the swirling flames. The wind blew hot and rich with the smell of blood and burnt meat, so strong he began to slaver.  
&gt;  
&gt;	He sniffed at the drifting smoke. *Men, many men, many horses, and fire, fire, fire.* No smell was more dangerous. The smoke and ash clouded his eyes, and in the sky he saw a great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame. Behind the cliffs tall fires were eating up the stars.  
&gt;  
&gt;	All through the night the fires crackled, and once there was a great roar and a crash that made the earth jump under his feet. Dogs barked and whined and horses screamed in terror. Howls shuddered through the night; the howls of the man-pack, wails of fear and wild shouts, laughter and screams.  
&gt;  
&gt;	The dark place was pulling at him by then, the house of whispers where all men were blind. He could feel its cold fingers on him. The stony smell of it was a whisper up the nose. He struggled against the pull. He did not like the darkness. He was wolf. He was hunter and stalker and slayer, and he belonged with his brothers and sisters in the deep woods, running free beneath a starry sky. He sat on his haunches, raised his head, and howled. *I will not go*, he cried. *I am wolf, I will not go*. Yet even so the darkness thickened, until it covered his eyes and filled his nose and stopped his ears, so he could not see or smell or hear or run, and all was black and still and black and cold and black and dead and black…  
&gt;  
&gt;	“*Bran*,” a voice was whispering softly. “*Bran, come back. Come back now, Bran. Bran…*”  
&gt;  
&gt;	He closed his third eye and opened the other two, the old two, the blind two. In the dark place all men were blind. But someone was holding him. He could feel arms around him, the warmth of a body snuggled close. He could hear Hodor singing. »

# To go further:

&amp;#x200B;

As we have mentioned, humans have been confronted with CotF wherever they were present. And of course, the intermixing is not limited to the Neck, Naath and Leng. In reality, it is a *global* phenomenon. In other words, many humans have CotF among their distant ancestors. 

&amp;#x200B;

Traces of these intermixings can be found in many regions : almost everywhere in Westeros but also in Braavos, for example. 

	

In myths and legends :

\- The Warg King was a human being allied to the CotF. The Starks would have killed his sons and kept his daughters. 

\- Artys Arryn, the Winged Knight, is a legendary character whose wife, a CotF, died in childbirth. Its history blends and merges with that of Ser Artys Arryn, the Winged Knight, founder of the Arryn house and Robert Arryn's distant ancestor.

	

In secondary characters :

\- Jenny of Oldstones

\- Dick Crabbe

\- Elaena Targaryen

\- Mya Stone

	

In more important characters :

\- Tywin Lannister has green eyes flecked with gold, like the Naathis. Could the Lannisters have CotF among their ancestors ? Well, there are those stories about Lann the Clever...

\- Melisandre, her terrifying beauty, her grace, her slender and fine body, her red hair, her red eyes, her musical voice, her powers, her longevity... Reading back her description and that of Leaf can be very interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

These are just a few examples, there are many more! 

See you soon!",asoiaf
"What was the relationship between Tyrion and Robert? I mean, if my memory isn't failing me, they never speak to each other in the books, do they? Do you think they got well along? Both like to drink, fuck and while they have many things in contrast they also both like to have fun. I understand people are more complex than that but considering Tyrion probably didn't see Robert as a political thread and Robert only saw Tyrion as his spouse's brother, they probably didn't have to much to worry about each other. They probably weren't BFF, but can you imagine a night in the fire, both of them having some wine in their hands, talking about trivial things? The things they could say, the jokes they could make... They're both some of the funniest characters in the books, both of them talking and laughing could have been tremendously entrataining.

Btw, the books are terrific, they've surprassed all of my expectations, although I'm still only at Clash of Kings, but really looking forward for the rest of them.",asoiaf
"I'm sure everyone's now seen GRRM's famous 'yes and no and yes and no' response to whether the books will end the same way as the show. *If* we take a 'yes' to apply to a new, slightly more democratic rule over Westeros (and ignore the actual details of it, because elective monarchy does not a stable government make) and improved conditions for the small-folk no longer broken by the wheel of the noble game of thrones, then we have to apply a 'no' to the Medium Length Night. 

In Western European history, the most rapid and dramatic improvement in the lives, rights, and conditions for common people was as a result of the Plague, which killed around 1/3 of the population. The resulting labour shortage and land availability made the following century a 'golden age' for peasants and labourers (not uncontested, as in many places the ruling class resisted with laws criminalising changing employment). 

If GRRM is looking to end on a hopeful note with the improved lives of the smallfolk -- and I think he is, given the strong thematic emphasis in ASOIAF on the suffering of the smallfolk -- then the coming of the Others will have to be as devasting to Westeros as the Plague was to Western Europe. Millions will die, the rich and the poor alike, shattering the existing social order to enable something new to be created.   Or, as Old Nan says: 

&gt;They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms, felled heroes and armies by the score, riding their pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain. All the swords of men could not stay their advance, and even maidens and suckling babes found no pity in them. 

Or, as Boccaccio wrote of the Plague:

&gt;How many valiant men, how many fair ladies, breakfast with their kinfolk and the same night supped with their ancestors in the next world! The condition of the people was pitiable to behold. They sickened by the thousands daily, and died unattended and without help. Many died in the open street, others dying in their houses, made it known by the stench of their rotting bodies. 

In addition, Euron's probable attack on Oldtown mirrors the particularly acute effect of the Plague on monasteries (centres of learning) because the sick sought refuge there. In the wake of the Plague, the lack of trained clergy opened up learning and religious leadership roles to people previously barred (including laymen and laywomen). The breaking of the order of the Maesters and their replacement by an even slightly more egalitarian educational system would again fit with GRRM's concern with the unjust effects of inequality on people's lives and prospects. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: The Others aren't climate change, they're the Black Death, and a lot more people are going to die because of them in the books than in the show.",asoiaf
"**Tl;dr** Much more characters than we thought may have CotF among their ancestors.

# Preamble

We recommend that you have read the fifth volume of the complete Iron Throne.

We will name Earth the world that some call Planetos.

All citations without reference are made up of combined excerpts from TWOIAF and the wikis of \[lagardedenuit.com\] and \[westeros.org\].

A detailed summary is at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I deleted the illustrations, not sure if they are allowed here. 

&amp;#x200B;

English is not my first language and I did best I could to translate this.

The only ambition of this text is to provide a pleasant reading.

# Introduction

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« - It's magic, he'd say.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- It's not, Cat said. The mouse was up your sleeve the whole time. I could see it moving. »  
&gt;  
&gt;AFFC - Cat of the Canals

&amp;#x200B;

The ASOIAF world is filled with dozens of different peoples and species. The Children of the Forest stand out for their ancestrality, appearance and powers. **What are they, exactly? Where do they come from? When and how did they appear?**

This mystery is built by George RR Martin as a game of hints and deductions. To solve it, we will investigate in the four corners of the known world, from the Neck to Leng, from Ib to Naath... and other even more mysterious places.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to discover the origin of the CotF, we must understand their nature. Morphology, physiology, reproduction, genetics, evolution, culture, lifestyle, society, environment... We will study in detail all their characteristics as a species.

First of all, let us recall what defines a species:

&amp;#x200B;

« A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which any two individuals of the appropriate sexes can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. »

&amp;#x200B;

Why would this definition be valid in the context of the fictional and fantastic world of ASOIAF? After all, what the author shows us are supernatural beings. It's magic, says GRRM.

But we, attentive readers, can see the mice moving in his sleeve. Big mice, hirsutes and taciturn....

&amp;#x200B;

Magic has its place in ASOIAF, but it is not always where we expect it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# 1- The Ibbenese case

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The first step of our long journey is in the Shivering Sea. The Ibbenese are an ancient people of islanders from the north of Essos. TWOIAF gives an extremely precise description of their morphological type.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« The Ibbenese stand apart from the rest of mankind. They are a heavy people, broad about the chest and shoulders, but seldom standing more than five and a half feet in height, with thick, short legs and long arms. Though short and squat, they are ferociously strong; at wrestling, their favorite sport, no man can hope to equal them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Their faces, characterized by sloping brows with heavy ridges, small sunken eyes, great square teeth, and massive jaws, seem brutish and ugly, an impression heightened by their guttural, grunting tongue. They are the most hirsute people in the known world. Though their flesh is pale, with dark blue veins beneath the skin, their hair is dark and wiry. Ibbenese men are heavily bearded; wiry body hair covers their arms, legs, chests, and backs. Coarse dark hair is common amongst their women, even on the upper lip. »

&amp;#x200B;

But above all, the text contains essential information about these people, of a biological nature.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**« Though the men of Ib can father children upon the women of Westeros and other lands, the products of such unions are often malformed and inevitably sterile, in the manner of mules. Ibbenese females, when mated with men from other races, bring forth naught but stillbirths and monstrosities. »**

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, this excerpt describes hybridization by interspecific crossing, a barbaric term if ever there was one. This is not to be confused with intraspecific crossing, as between two dogs of different breeds.

Here we are talking about reproduction between two distinct species, such as a horse and a donkey, a lion and a tiger, a camel and a lama.... These crosses have the particularity of producing individuals that are generally not very fertile or even sterile.

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, note the detail: the text specifies that there is a structural difference between the product of a union between an Ibbenese male and a human female (viable but sterile) and that of a union between an Ibbenese female and a human male (non-viable).

And the comparison with mules in the text is not innocent. Mules are sterile hybrids produced by a donkey and a mare. On the other hand, the mating of a stallion and a female donkey produces a different hybrid, the hinny, which is also sterile.

**This exerpt reveals that the definition of species is valid in the world of ASOIAF, and that humans and Ibenese are as genetically different as horses and donkeys are.**  This will not surprise anyone, as GRRM pays great attention to genetic considerations in general. It is known.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, although the Ibbenians resemble humans in the sense that they are intelligent primates who have developed a civilization, biologically speaking the two groups do not belong to the same species.

It is easy to imagine that the author had fun creating a world in which, in different places, different primates experienced a similar evolution and gave humans on one side, the Ibenians on another, etc....

Perhaps there is another explanation, but it is conceivable at least from the point of view of the complexity of the world created by GRRM ; whose fauna includes, as a reminder, all kinds of species inspired by our prehistory, mammoths and other ""walking lizards""...

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's get to the heart of the matter, and get interested in the CotF.

# 2 - Nature of the Children of the Forest

&amp;#x200B;

We have seen that, in the ASOIAF world, the question of the nature of species arises in terms of biology.

&amp;#x200B;

**The external appearance of the Ibbenians was only an indication of their true nature. Genetics provides the definitive proof, and reproduction is the determining criterion.**

&amp;#x200B;

Then let's repeat the exercise with the CotF. But this time it is a question of examining in detail everything we know about them.

Let us observe them very carefully, and above all, let us not stop at appearances.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« The Children are as **small** as children, but they are not childlike. They are **dark** and **beautiful** ; **slight**, **quick**, and **graceful**. They may live for centuries.  
&gt;  
&gt;They have **nut-brown skin, dappled like a deer's** with paler spots. Their hands have only **three fingers and a thumb**, with sharp black **claws** instead of nails. They have **large ears** that can hear things that no man can hear. They usually have **large gold and green eyes** slitted like those of a cat, allowing them to **see in dark** passages.  
&gt;  
&gt;Very rarely, one of the children is born with **mossy green or blood red eyes**, a sign that he have greensight.  
&gt;  
&gt;They were the first inhabitants of Westeros with the giants. They could once be found from the Lands of Always Winter to the shores of the Summer Sea.  
&gt;  
&gt;They lived in a crude manner. They worked no metal, but they had **great art in working obsidian** to make tools and weapons. They wove no cloths but were skilled in making garments of leaves and bark. They weave leaves and vines and flowers into their hair, and wear cloaks of leaves. They learned to make **bows** of weirwood and to construct flying **snares** of grass, and both of the sexes hunted with these.  
&gt;  
&gt;They resided in the **woods**, in **crannogs**, in **bogs** and **marshes**, and even in **caverns** and **hollow hills**. It is said that, in the woods, they made **shelters of leaves and withes** up in the branches of trees.  
&gt;  
&gt;They call themselves *those who sing the song of earth*, the giants call them *little squirrel people*.  
&gt;  
&gt;They often sing, and their **song** and **music** were said to be as **beautiful** as they were.  
&gt;  
&gt;The gods they worshipped were the innumerable **gods of the streams and forests and stones**.  
&gt;  
&gt;It was the children who **carved** the weirwoods with faces.  
&gt;  
&gt;They were led by their wise men, the greenseers, whose **powers** enabled them to see through the eyes of the carved weirwoods, see events at a great distance, communicate across half a realm, delve into the past and see far into the future.  
&gt;  
&gt;The **skinchangers** communicated with beasts, and could control them by having their spirits mingle.  
&gt;  
&gt;The **hunters** among the Children became their **warriors** as First Men invaded their territory. »

&amp;#x200B;

It should be remembered that the CotF were also present in Essos, which is not surprising because this continent was once connected to Westeros.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« The land of Ifequevron is a huge swathe of northern Essos, a **densely wooded** region that had formerly been the home of a **small**, **shy forest folk**, that Dothraki called *those who walk in the woods*. Some say that the Ibbenese extinguished this gentle race, whilst others believe they went into hiding in the deeper woods or fled to other lands.  
&gt;  
&gt;Corlys Velaryon visited these woods, he wrote of **carved trees**, haunted **grottoes**, and **strange silences**. The little people blessed a household that left offerings of **leaf and stone and water** overnight.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Dothraki had shunned those forests; some say this was because of their reverence for the vanished wood walkers, others because they feared their **powers**. »

&amp;#x200B;

Note the strange *silences*, which refer to the music and songs of the CotF. A poetic way of identifying them by their absence.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, we are dealing with an ancient and primitive people, living in harmony with nature. We remember the CotF for their skill, their music, their craftsmanship, their powers...

And their very strange eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

Eye colour and size are particularly interesting, as they are very important in general in ASOIAF. Members of the same family often have similar eyes. Sometimes the eyes can reveal a character's secret identity. Here they will interest us especially as a hereditary genetic trait.

The description of the Forest Children may suggest that they are a species in their own right, but the reproduction data is missing to confirm or disprove this.

&amp;#x200B;

**However, if we could demonstrate that CotF and humans can produce viable and fertile offspring, we could conclude that, unlike the Ibbenian case, these two groups constitute a single species.**

&amp;#x200B;

There is no formal proof of this, but strong clues suggesting that humans and CotFs can indeed have children, and that they themselves can generate offspring. Everyone will form an intimate conviction after examining the facts.

&amp;#x200B;

These clues includes human groups that seem to share certain very particular characteristics with the CotF.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's follow the CotF trail where they lived, because they left their mark.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# The mixed peoples

&amp;#x200B;

Terminology note: For simplicity, *mixed people* and *intermixing* will refer to the mixing of two populations, in genetic and cultural terms.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If, in the past, humans and CotF interbred, their descendants must have hereditary genetic traits. And it is !

&amp;#x200B;

We will observe three peoples, and see that they share with the CotF many morphological, physiological, and cultural characteristic.

The latter are not evidence in themselves, but they are interesting to note because, when added to the other characteristics, they become an additional clue of population mixing.

&amp;#x200B;

**The idea is that human populations have lived in contact with the CotF, that crossbreeding has taken place, and that these peoples are its descendants.**

&amp;#x200B;

First let us give an overview of these three peoples.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Crannogmen

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start with the most famous of these three peoples, from which Meera and Jojen Reed come.

&gt;« The crannogmen are a **reclusive people** who dwell in the  Neck, a land covered in **swamp** and **bog**, **infested** with quicksand, lizard-lions, snakes and poisonous plants. The histories say that the crannogmen grew close to the Children of the Forest.  
&gt;  
&gt;They live in **houses of thatch and woven reeds**. wield **nets** and use poisonned **arrows**. They are talented **hunters** and **warriors**. Despite their **slight stature** and somewhat primitive lifestyle, they have proven a notoriously **difficult people to conquer**.  
&gt;  
&gt;They saw their kings as the first among equals, who were often thought to be touched by the **old gods**—a fact that show itself in **eyes of strange hues** (like Jojen Reed's **unusually deep mossy green eyes**), or even in **speaking with animals**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some claim the Crannogmen's **small stature** results from inadequate nourishment, other say it is because they **intermarried** with the Children of the Forest. »

The last sentence, although speculative, is full of meaning. Not only is this a formal reference in the text to possible crossbreeding, but it emphasizes a genetic consideration: the transmission of hereditary traits ; and even suggests the evolution of a human group as a result of this transmission.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Naathis

&amp;#x200B;

Let's continue with the people from which Missandei comes.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« In the Summer Sea lies the mysterious island of Naath, known to the ancients as the Isle of Butterflies, which inland is made of **hills** and **forests**.  
&gt;  
&gt;The people native to the island have round flat faces, **dusky skin**, and **large**, **soft amber eyes, oft flecked with gold**. They are as **clever** as they are **gentle**, **fair to look upon**, and quick to learn obedience.  
&gt;  
&gt;The **Peaceful** People, the Naathi are called, for they will not fight even in defense of their homes and persons. They do not kill, not even beasts of the field and wood; they eat fruit, not flesh, and make **music**, not war. Their **fine handicrafts**, shimmering silks, and delicate spiced wines are exported to a large number of countries. The god of Naath is called the Lord of **Harmony**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Whilst the docile nature of the Naathi seem to make their island ripe for conquest, strangers do not live long upon the Isle of Butterflies. Yet **none of these invaders survived**, and the native claim that none lasted more than a year, for some evil humor lurks in the very air of this fair isle, and all those who linger too long on Naath soon succumb. The Naathi themselves are seemingly untroubled by the illness. Some believe that it is spread by the butterflies. »

&amp;#x200B;

# The Lengiis

&amp;#x200B;

The second part of our journey ends in an even more exotic and mysterious land.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« The verdant isle of Leng, which history goes back very far, surrounded by the waters of the Jade Sea.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are queer ruins in the depths of the island's **jungle**: massive buildings, long fallen, and so overgrown that rubble remains above the surface...but underground, **endless labyrinths of tunnels** lead to **vast chambers**, and carved steps descend hundreds of feet into the earth.  
&gt;  
&gt;The native Lengii are perhaps the tallest of all the known races of mankind, with many men amongst them reaching seven feet in height, and some as tall as eight. Long-legged and **slender**, with **flesh the color of oiled teak**, they have **large golden eyes** and can supposedly **see farther and better** than other men, especially **at night**. Though formidably tall, the women of the Lengii are famously **lithe** and **lovely**, of **surpassing beauty**.  
&gt;  
&gt;For much of its history, Leng has been an isle of mystery, for the native Lengii seldom sailed beyond sight of their own shores, and such seafarers who chanced to glimpse their coasts met a **cold reception** should they dare to come ashore. The Lengii had no interest in foreign gods, foreign goods, foreign food or dress or customs; nor did they allow outsiders to mine their gold, harvest their trees, gather their fruit, or fish their seas. Those who attemped to do so met a swift and bloody end. Leng became known as a haunt of demons and sorcerers, **a place to be avoided**, a closed island.  
&gt;  
&gt;The great apes of Leng are also farfamed; amongst them are spotted humpback apes said to be almost as clever as men, and hooded apes as large as giants, so strong that they can pull the arms and legs off a man as easily as a boy might pull the wings off a fly. »

&amp;#x200B;

# Evidences about intermixing

Let us examine in detail the characteristics of these peoples which are clues of intermixing between humans and CotF.

&amp;#x200B;

# Environment

&amp;#x200B;

Their environment (marshes and bogs, forests and hills, jungle and caves), typical of the kind of environment that the CotF like, indicates that they may have been present on these territories in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

The existence of caves and tunnels is not mentioned about Naath and the Neck. In fact, if there are any on Naath, we have no way of knowing, since no stranger has stayed on the island long enough to explore it in depth. As for the underground passages of the Neck, they are certainly flooded (see the particular history of this region).

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, it should be noted that these regions are singularly isolated, an essential feature from an evolutionary point of view. Indeed, these three peoples have in common that they live in an environment cut off from the outside world for several reasons :

\- or by its geography in the case of Naath and Leng islands ;

\- or by the hostility of nature ;

\- or by the fierce nature of its inhabitants ;

\- by its bad reputation, an element common to all three regions.

&amp;#x200B;

These places may have fostered a certain mix between the human populations and the CotF present, as well as an evolution in isolation.

&amp;#x200B;

# Way of living

&amp;#x200B;

We are not going to insist on the culture, we have already mentioned that it does not constitute formal proof of intermixing.

&amp;#x200B;

Let us simply note that the cultures of these very old peoples indicate that they have been close to the CotF. Probably in peaceful coexistence, because these three peoples are peaceful, have never shown any desire for external conquest, and respect nature.

&amp;#x200B;

# Powers

&amp;#x200B;

We know that among the CotF, some individuals called skinchangers or greenseers possessed powers.

The powers of the CotF are explicitly mentioned in relation to the Crannogmen.

The Naathis, on the other hand, seem to have a deep relationship with the butterflies of their island.

&amp;#x200B;

# Biology

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, these peoples have their own physical characteristics. The Lengiis are tall but it's not proof that they didn't lived close to the CotF. First, each environment produces its own subspecies. Moreover, the human ancestors of these three peoples were probably different from each other : the initial physical characteristics being not the same, the intermixing will give different results.

&amp;#x200B;

What interests us is those they have in common with the CotF, because it can be assumed that they acquired these hereditary traits through reproduction with the CotF, and that they were then transmitted from generation to generation.

&amp;#x200B;

Many features in the morphology of the mixed peoples recall the CotF. The Lengiis even have a physiological condition specific to CotF : night vision.

&amp;#x200B;

**But the eyes are the best indicator of the intermixing between human populations and CotF.**  In particular the colour of the irises: the golden specific to the CotF is found among the Naathis and Lengiis. As for the Crannogmen, the text mentions eyes of a strange colour, and Jojen Reed's description is unequivocal.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« The cat was an ordinary cat, no more. The others expected a fabulous beast, so that is what they saw. How large it was, they said. It was no larger than any other cat, only fat from indolence, for the Sealord fed it from his own table. What curious small ears, they said. Its ears had been chewed away in kitten fights. And it was plainly a tomcat, yet the Sealord said ‘her,’ and that is what the others saw. »  
&gt;  
&gt;AGOT – Arya IV

&amp;#x200B;

The mixed peoples are humans with CotF among their ancestors. We can imagine that human populations arrived on territories occupied by the CotF. As long as these humans were peaceful and respected nature, these two groups could coexist. Over time, intermixing has taken place, and traces of it can be found in current populations.

&amp;#x200B;

**In conclusion, all the clues are there to affirm that crossbreeding has taken place on a relatively large scale, which demonstrates that biologically humans and CotF are in fact one and the same species.**

&amp;#x200B;

The CotF are not supernatural beings, contrary to what the author leads us to believe. Since humans are the main subject of GRRM, this choice seems consistent. And it is not just another twist on a character's secret identity, because it is related the deep themes of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But before elaborating on the author's intentions, we must establish the origin of the CotF. The third and last part of our journey will take us back in time.

&amp;#x200B;

And we will see that, like the gigantic yellow cat with small ears of the Sealord, the specificities of the CotF have a rational explanation.

Terminology note: For the sake of clarity we will continue to distinguish between the terms human and CotF.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# 3- Origin of the Children of the Forest

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« Oh, to be sure, there is much we do not understand. The years pass in their hundreds and their thousands, and what does any man see of life but a few summers, a few winters? We look at mountains and call them eternal, and so they seem . . . but in the course of time, mountains rise and fall, rivers change their courses, stars fall from the sky, and great cities sink beneath the sea. Even gods die, we think. **Everything changes.** »  
&gt;  
&gt;Maester Luwin, ACOK – Bran IV

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« **There are none who can say with certain knowledge when the world began.** Is it forty thousand years old, as some hold, or perhaps a number as large as five hundred thousand - or even more ? It is not written in any book that we know, for in the first age of the world, the Dawn Age, men were not lettered.  
&gt;  
&gt;What can most accurately be told about the Dawn Age? The eastern lands were awash with many peoples. But on Westeros only two peoples existed : the Children of the Forest and the the giants. »  
&gt;  
&gt;TWOIAF

Let's be precise : it is said that the CotF preceded humans in Westeros, not on Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

**It is not said where, when or how humans appeared.**

**It is not said where, when or how the CotF appeared.**

&amp;#x200B;

It's not about nitpick. The question of origins is omnipresent in ASOIAF.

&amp;#x200B;

Who are the (true) ancestors of the characters?

Where do dragons, weirwood, the Others come from?

What happened in Summerhall, Hardhome, Ashaï... ?

&amp;#x200B;

How much truth is contained in the myths and legends of the past?

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning of the Dawn Age, indeed, the CotF occupied almost all the known world. And their encounter with humans took place in a second phase.

But what interests us takes place precisely before the Dawn Age.

&amp;#x200B;

Because the Dawn Age is not the first age of the world. ASOIAF takes into consideration long time and evolution, so the CotF must come from somewhere.

And it is not impossible in itself that humans and CotF belong to the same species. They are just two extremely different groups.

&amp;#x200B;

All that remains is the following question: what events may have led to this situation, where two such physically different human groups coexist on the surface of the Earth?

We could make hypotheses, but responding in a global, coherent and contextualized way requires a thorough examination of the CotF.

Some may have wondered how the presence of the Cot in the islands of Naath and Leng was possible, given that they are never presented as a people of sailors. This question seems less important, but we will see that it is part of the matter.

Without discussing the nature of magic, let's observe that humans have the same skills as CotF, the best example being Bran Stark.

So either magic transcends species, or the powers are specific to the human species. The second hypothesis seems to be the right one, as there is no mention of Ibbenians, giants and other evolved primates with CotF powers.

**In any case, powers cannot help us to differentiate between the two groups we are interested in.**

&amp;#x200B;

# Way of life

&amp;#x200B;

The way of life of the CotF is very similar to that of primitive human peoples: hunting, fishing, war, music, crafts (making tools, clothing and shelters), animist religion, preservation and transmission of memory of ancestors... The image of a classic hunter-gatherer tribe.

It should also be noted that they live in groups, which is not the case for some non-human peoples. It's a detail but it's very coherent from an anthropological point of view.

**In short, their lifestyle is no different from that of humans: studying their behaviour confirms what genetics has proven.**

&amp;#x200B;

# Society

&amp;#x200B;

A quick digression, which will be important later, about the civilizational differences between CotF and humans.

We know too little to say, but we may wonder whether the CotF powers have not profoundly changed their society. In particular the possibility of communicating quickly over long distances, as well as a perfect memory of the past. Perhaps also that their power to mix minds has increased the share of empathy in their psychology.

We find no evidence of war between CotF: have they succeeded in building a peaceful society?

The clues of the past presence of the CotF are the same everywhere, and it is because of this that we can identify them. The CotF seem to have a single language, a single culture, which suggests a globalized and unified society.

CotFs modify their environment extremely little, preferring to adapt to it. It seems that they have reached a stage where they can live in harmony with nature.

&amp;#x200B;

# Biology

&amp;#x200B;

So far we have observed beings that are not so different from humans : CotF simply have very particular physical characteristics.

&amp;#x200B;

Let us recall the specificities of the CotF: they are smaller than humans, have nut-brown dappled with paler spots, large slitted eyes, four fingers including one thumb, sharp claws, large ears, very developed hearing, and they see in the dark.

&amp;#x200B;

First we notice that, unlike humans, **the CotF have kept long sharp claws despite the fact that they use tools and weapons, including sharp blades.** From an evolutionary point of view, this observation must question us.

Are the CotF simply humans who have developed claws and other particular morphological and physiological characteristics? We have established that it is possible that the existence of humans precedes that of the CotF on Earth. We don't know which one appeared first: perhaps the CotF are the descendants of a group of humans, after all.

Humans that would have evolved because of mutant fungi from space, for example. Or to adapt to a new environment.

&amp;#x200B;

However, we can see that this is typically the type of features that can result from an evolution due to the environment. So let's leave the mutant fungi aside.

The skin of the CotF, compared in the text to a deer's one, evokes their forest life.

Their ears and especially their eyes show a good adaptation to nightlife, or generally to a dark environment.

Their small size tends to show an adaptation to a confined environment.

**The four-toed clawed front legs are typical of some rodent and burrowing mammals such as squirrels (of course), but also prairie dogs and groundhogs.** In fact, these animals have five fingers, but their legs are adapted to their use, and the thumb is atrophied or even invisible. We can imagine that the same is true for the CotF, that they simply have a finger largely atrophied, but that unlike animals they have kept the thumb, which they use to handle tools and weapons.

&amp;#x200B;

So, to what environment should humans have adapted to develop all these physical characteristics?

&amp;#x200B;

# Underground

&amp;#x200B;

It's time to talk about the CotF link to the underground. Indeed, let us recall that, surprisingly, this people is known to appreciate two very different types of environment: wooded or marshy environments, and then caves, hollow hills, and any kind of tunnels... which is surprising in itself. The CotF are well adapted to life in the forest, which seems to be their natural environment.  What is the point of going underground ?

# Refuge

&amp;#x200B;

The underground seems to be the CotF's natural refuge when they feel threatened. We have many examples of this, such as in the Stormlands during the conflict between the First Men and the Andals.

This raises the question of their subsistence. How do they survive, once they take refuge in the tunnels ? Do they go out at night to hunt ? Do they feed on rats ? Without claiming anything, let us simply remember that the Giants called the CotF *the people who store for winter*.

&amp;#x200B;

# Obsidian 

&amp;#x200B;

It seems to be a volcanic rock, but we will not discuss the nature or origin of obsidian. Let us simply point out that this material has magical properties and that it is found in its raw state, among other places, in the old tunnels beneath the Peyredragon mountain.

For the CotF, obsidian is the raw material of their primitive technology. They cut this sharp but fragile stone to obtain blades and arrowheads.

At first sight, knowledge of obsidian is not a specificity of the CotF: the Valyrians used it to make magic candles to see and communicate over long distances. On the other hand, it is never mentioned about mixed race peoples. It seems that, despite the intermixing, the CotF did not wish to share this knowledge with the humans they met. We can suspect the CotF to know the magical properties of the obsidian, and to use it for more... secret uses.

One last detail about the obsidian. TWOIAF emphasizes the great art with which the CotF work with this material, which suggests that they have a perfect mastery of it. Moreover, they did not invent weaving and continue to make clothes from raw materials. Could it be that the use of obsidian constitutes for them a more ancient knowledge than those related to life in the woods?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, they are very well adapted to the underground world (perhaps even better than to the forest, where they had to develop a minimum of technologies necessary for their survival), and that they have a perfect knowledge of underground networks.

This could explain their presence in the islands of Leng, Naath, and certainly others (there are indications of their presence on Skagos, in particular).

The underground could well be the primal environment of the CotF.

# Conclusion

&amp;#x200B;

We have found that the CotF, despite superficial differences, are extremely close to humans, which confirms the demonstration by genetics.

All our observations lead us to ask the question: **are the CotF the descendants of humans who have been forced to live below the earth's surface long enough to evolve there, thus adapting to this new and extreme environment?**

The next step is to place this assumption in the general context of ASOIAF.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Theory

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« The First Men named us children. The giants called us the squirrel people, because we were small and quick and fond of trees, but we are no squirrels, no children. Before your Old Tongue was ever spoken, we had sung our songs **ten thousand years**. »  
&gt;  
&gt;Leaf, ADWD – Bran II

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« Men should not go wandering in this place… The river you hear is swift and black, and flows down and down to a sunless sea. And there are passages that go even deeper, bottomless pits and sudden shafts, forgotten ways that lead to the very center of the earth. Even my people have not explored them all, and we have lived here for **a thousand thousand of your man-years**. »  
&gt;  
&gt;Leaf, ADWD – Bran III

&amp;#x200B;

Who are the CotF ? Where do they come from ? When and how did they appear ?

This is my theory.

&amp;#x200B;

Long before the Long Night, long before the Dawn Age, at a time when the CotF did not yet exist, humans already populated the Earth.

It all starts when a disaster strikes. A cataclysm. The apocalypse. Extreme glacial era, comet impact, invasion of mutant fungi... Whatever its nature, it is a disruption of such magnitude that it will eradicate the human species from the surface of the Earth for a very, very long time.

Thus begins the Night Age.

&amp;#x200B;

Humans have managed to survive and perpetuate the species. ASOIAF tells the story of their very distant descendants: the CotF people and the First Men.

&amp;#x200B;

The CotF's ancestors are humans who hid far, far below the Earth's surface. These humans survived despite everything. Over time, they have evolved physically to adapt to underground life. And somehow, some of them have acquired powers. But their true nature remains unchanged : they are still humans. This new people takes the name of ""those who sing the song of *earth*"".

As for the ancestors of the First Men, they were able to survive in some shelter, without having to adapt to a new environment. In a bunker, an arch, or a lunar base.... A place that must look like Winterfell or the Eyrie. An impregnable fortress, isolated from the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Time passes. Centuries and millennia, possibly more. Until finally the Earth's surface becomes inhabitable again.

&amp;#x200B;

So the CotF, wherever possible, come out of the underground and gradually adapt to life in the forest.

This is Dawn Age day one.

Humans, in turn, emerge from their shelter and begin to repopulate the entire Earth. In many places, they will be confronted with the CotF.

Much later will happen the Long Night and all the events narrated in ASOIAF.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The apocalypse, mutant humans... Oh, I know what you're thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

*That's exactly the kind of story GRRM likes to tell !*

" \*\*sorry if this is a re post, i didnt see this post on asoiaf page the first time i posted it

I just do not buy Bran the King because even if I do not doubt even a little bit that it won't be written well but it doesn't make sense at few levels.

**Firstly, look at Bran's character**

A good King must know his subjects well and must be loved and then will he get the smallfolk's loyalty.

We see this right from book 1, we learn that Ned dines with his family everyday and sometimes brings in one person, usually some worker from the castle, or some other nobleman from the nearby houses and he does this because a ruler needs to show the workers some love and hospitality in return of their work. And this does pay off in the end, Ned's guard and servants proved to be loyal until the very end and tried to protect Ned until their last breath.

And is this trait necessary? Yes, completely. The biggest example in front of us is Stannis and Renly, Stannis is a hard, rigid man who is very capable of being a King, an able military commander and just and yet people flocked to Renly because he used to talk to everyone, again like Ned, used to talk to small folk (in the show) and that's why he had the support of the small folk despite not being the immediate heir and not being a known commander or a leader.

There were 2 Targaryen Kings as well, Aegon III and Aerys I who are hardly remembered because they never paid any special interest in the small folk and were always in their own world.

 **About Bran's army**

Now let's assume that North still decides to be in the part of the Seven Kingdoms for simplicity, yet who will defend Bran when it is really urgent? Look at the War of Five Kings, Ned was imprisoned in King's Landing and Robb called all his bannermen and they even had the Riverlands support and yet he couldn't reach in time. Even in the Dance of Dragons, it was noted that the Northern army took time because the North itself is very huge so assembling takes time and travelling to King's Landing is even harder with 2 other Kingdoms in their way, Riverlands and Vale so who will protect Bran in times of urgency?

**Lastly, about the gods he preaches**

We see from the prologue of ADWD that warging is considered as an abomination and that Varamyr was kicked out of his house because of it and wasn't accepted in the society and these were the Freefolk where everything is allowed and wargs were known and common as well then what about the normal Westerosi people? The wildlings are scorned at because they are known to change skins into animals and all, how would they react to their King who himself does all this actively?

Look at Stannis, another big point which brought him down was for preaching a foreign god, and Bran will do the exact same thing, true there are known to be dozen Houses which follow the Old Gods but for the majority of the South, they are still foreign, the early Targaryens were plagued by the Faith for half a century even though they themselves converted to Faith, then how would the Faith react if their King is of some other religion and does all the abominable things himself?

That is why, I just don't like Bran being the King in the end of the books.

"So I was rewatching the show and I got to the scene where Baelish is talking to one of his prostitutes, Ros. He tries to threaten her to become happier by saying this;

“A very wealthy patron – he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl to use her in ways that never occur to most men.”

"I often read posts where people say they are rereading the books and their opinion of a character has changed. Tyrion seems less good and more self-pitying, or they have more patience for Sansa, or they are more concerned about character X. To what degree do you think this is caused by GRRM writing POVs that somewhat mislead the audience's judgement versus this is an effect of later character development?

A classic example of this question is Dany. I have read posts arguing that while Dany has wonderful moments of compassion, she's already pretty ruthless and throne obsessed even in the first novel. Other posts argue just as strongly that Dany's dark twist came out of nowhere.  How much of dark Dany in future books will be the result of Dany's character changing and how much is a result of GRRM showing how she appears through other points of views? In other words, if you had more POVs around Dany, would readers already be more concerned?

I don't think POV vs. character arc is a binary choice. Obviously characters will develop and change and the reader's perspective will also change as the reader gets more information about the situation and the world. But I'm interested in how much we are intentionally misled a bit on our impressions of characters at the beginning.",asoiaf
"The [Food Code](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/95101-the-food-code-of-ice-and-fire/) is an interesting essay detailing the symbolism of different foods in ASOIAF, and if you haven't read the whole thing, do yourself a favor. The part about boar being used as a herald to a shift in power is the part I'll be referencing here:

&gt;Next we have boar. This seems to denote regime change or a shift in power. Robert's hunting party goes in search of boar before Bran is defenestrated. Most clearly, Robert is killed by a boar and actually thinks it's a god-sent punishment for his plan to kill Dany; the boar is served at his funeral. In between Yoren's death and being captured by the Lannisters, Arya and her friends discuss hunting boar. Boar is served at the Winterfell harvest feast before the ironborn and Theon take over the castle.

 I was watching the new Preston Jacobs video, when this line from Jon IX AGoT popped out at me:

&gt;""All I know is that the blood of the First Men flows in the veins of the Starks. The First Men built the Wall, and it's said they remember things otherwise forgotten. And that beast of yours... he led us to the wights, warned you of the dead man on the steps. Ser Jaremy would doubtless call that happenstance, yet Ser Jaremy is dead and I'm not."" Lord Mormont stabbed a chunk of ham with the point of his dagger. ""I think you were meant to be here, and I want you and that wolf of yours with us when we go beyond the Wall.""

The ""between the lines"" part that really stuck out was
&gt;Lord Mormont stabbed a chunk of ham with the point of his dagger.

It felt like a neat little nudge that something significant was going to happen as a result of Mormont's faith in Jon's place at the wall. I know it's not boar perse, but it's close enough when we're at this stage of mining for things we haven't caught yet.",asoiaf
"One of the quotes or Martin's that gets repeated often is his quote about Aragorn. ""Tolkien tells us that Aragorn ruled wisely and well, but how do we know?""

Well, Mr. Martin, how do we know Bran ruled wisely and well?

I like the idea of the final King not being the prophesied prince but rather the boy in a wheelchair who proves himself wise and just, but... Well, in my opinion Martin hasn't earned it. Bran's arc is about many things, but leadership isn't one of them. Sure, we can come up with neat ideas as far as foreshadowing and cool aesthetics like an Aegon Targaryen kneeling to a Brandon Stark, or Bran looking into Jon's eyes and not executing him like Ned taught him in the first chapter. But as far as nuts and bolts character arcs, so far Martin hasn't earned his wise and just King, in my opinion.

When Ned discovered the truth about Cersei's children, he wanted to tell Robert, but when Robert died, he turned to Stanis as the rightful heir. Did the Targaryens lose all the rights to the throne after Robert's rebellion, including both Vyseris and Dany, and Jon as Raeghar's son? When Bran tells Sam abouts Jon's parents, and they realize he is a Targ, Bran says that he is the rightful heir to the throne? Is it only because Stanis and Renly are dead? Does it mean that, were they alive, as the last of the Baratheons, Jon as a Targ would not have a claim to the throne?

Do you think Ned would ever tell Jon the truth about his parents, about who he really is and what he might be? Perhaps after Robert's death? Or do you think he would rather keep it a secret to protect Jon, to prevent a possible war, even though it wouldn't be fair to Jon and wouldn't be honourable?

"So hear me out. Had a crazy dream last night that involved a Game of Thrones crossover with my best friends. Basically we enacted the ending of the series as the characters. 

When I woke up, I remembered how we dispatched of the Mountain. Clearly he cannot be poisoned, killed by normal means, or even slightly deterred without the sacrifice of men. However the show tells us how he met his end by falling from a castle into a fire, via the Hound. 

My proposal:
Instead of Sandor kamikaze-ing himself, we contract about twenty Dothraki screamers to lasso the Mountain and drag him off a cliff into a fiery inferno. 
The Mountain can't do anything at range, and this leaves plenty of room for error if one of the Dothraki fail.

"So what parts of the show's ending and the end for the individual characters can we expect to see in the books? GRRM refers to the ending being his in a broad sense but that could mean a few things.

Objectively speaking, i think King Bran is definitely GRRM's ending. Ignoring the fact that its been confirmed by the actor and D&amp;D about being word of GRRM, D&amp;D have no real reason for lying about it being GRRM's and they have no reason to favour Bran. D&amp;D are many things but i don't think they ever claimed to be fans of Bran's character. I'm not even sure if he was in season 5. D&amp;D are often accused of favouring certain characters over others due to personal bias which can be hard to refute in some cases. But they haven't exactly concealed that Arya and Cersei and their respective actresses are their favourites. Why would they suddenly decide Bran needs some love? After perhaps Stannis and Renly, they clearly cared least for Bran. I'm surprised they didn't find a way to kill him off, that would have surprised people.

Jon's ending i actually quite like in some ways. Azor Ahai stabs his lover, leaving him with a sword and a broken heart to depart into darkness of either the Nights Watch or Beyond the Wall. He finally receives the answer to the question he asked Ned before he left for the Nights Watch about his mother, and its certainly not the one he expected. As for his role in defeating the potential apocalypse in the Others, I don't know. My problem with Jon Snow being the chosen one and being so important that he needed to be born is it almost validates Rhaegar and Lyanna's terrible decision to elope. I mean last we see of him in the books he is in the process of deserting the Nights Watch despite the unrest between the Watch and Wildlings and how the last guy through the gate, Borroq a skinchanger, flat out tells him the Others are coming all in the pursuit of vengeance.

Dany's ending makes some sense too. The 'Mad Queen'. The foreign conqueror. From my perspective, it will hardly matter whether or not Dany does go 'mad' or burn down Kings Landing intentionally, her enemies will label her as thus and will attribute the blame of a such an event to her whether intentional or not. At the end of the day, Dany is a foreigner to the people of Westeros (she even has a Tyroshi accent), she is a conqueror and shes actually quite good at it all things considered. Her strategy in beating the slave cities whilst ruthless and i suppose 'without honour' weren't without intelligence and she did it with negative casualties gaining more troops then she lost. But conquest and ruling are two different things and Dany is shown to struggle with rulership in Mereen. Given Tyrion's machinations with fAegon, if fAegon fulfils the same role as show Cersei its hard to see how Dany will not be seen negatively. Dany will be arriving with 3 fire breathing monsters renowned for killings thousands and torching landscape, eunuch slave soldiers or alternatively a fanatical army of foreign infantrymen that answer exclusively to her, Dothraki and at her side one of the most despised men in Westeros...Tyrion.

Tyrion's ending...seemed too simple really. After all that his main contribution was a speech so convincing he basically told the most powerful remaining people in Westeros not only how they should run things but who should lead them. Tyrion's most recent chapters are some really dark stuff and he isn't exactly the most popular man in Westeros at the moment. They are already making him the villain in plays based off the events of War of the Five Kings and his appearance is hardly helping his image. The first lesson he teaches to fAegon is one of mistrust and he encourages him to invade despite him knowing just how dire the situation in Westeros is for the motivation of getting revenge. Its hard to imagine Tyrion as he was in the show where he was the 'good guy'. Perhaps villain is too strong a word, but its hard to see him being a good influence on much. Also, I think the whole him not being mentioned in the book about the series events in universe is a bit out. Every story needs a villain, whether he is one or not the story won't mention him positively.

Cersei and Jaime i really don't know. I find the whole 'show Cersei is fAegon' quite convincing and it could really change Cersei's story. I find it kind of hard to see Cersei being anyway competent after reading A Feast for Crows

Sam and Bronn. Can't see it. Maybe its too subtle for me but really didn't get their endings.

"As we all know, in ancient to medieval times, salt was a prized mineral. It's as vital today as it was since time memorial, just a lot cheaper due to mass production and abundance. Obviously, ASOIAF is based upon the real world and even real world events that we can draw parallels as a basis for our imaginations. 

In the stories, salt is mentioned many times as far as importance to where someone was sitting at the table - due to the limited availability of salt and I presume the price of salt?

Now, it's never mentioned where the salt comes from. We have the Saltpans which somehow produces SOME salt but the Lord is a petty lord and holdings small. If there was a lot of salt there, why wouldn't he be much more powerful? There's also the Salt shores but no real mention of salt production.

We know the Lannnisters have gold mines and tin and Iron come from the Iron islands, for the most part. It'd be nice if they mentioned where copper came from but that's whatever. I want to know what lord controls the salt as they would surely have vast holdings, money, and power for controlling such a vital commodity.

Rome was infamous for its salt mines. If you have a city of a million people, such as Kings Landing, small scale salt production won't cut it. There's gotta be salt mining operations somewhere and a lord that controls it.",asoiaf
"In the sample chapter 'The Forsaken' from The Winds of Winter this is a quote from one of Aeron's visions after Euron makes him drink shade of the evening.

I think the burning forest is a foreshadowing of the burning of the library/citadel at Oldtown. It seems likely Euron will be attacking Oldtown in The Winds of Winter and a library is a symbolic 'forest' as books are made out of trees. I can't think what literal forest Euron would be burning so the symbolic interpretation seems more likely to me.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to this Oldtown parallels the ancient city of Alexandria, both having famous lighthouses and libraries and being centres of learning. The library at Alexandria was damaged by fire and eventually lost entirely. I'd wager George RR Martin has set up the library/citadel at Oldtown to be burned down.",asoiaf

"I’m just hitting this point in ASoS, but I’ve seen the show so I know what’s coming. A couple things have stood out to me:

1. Cat tells Robb to make sure he eats something ASAP when he gets inside so he has guest right.

2. Grey Wind starts growling as soon as the Freys ride out to meet them, going so far as to charge them and ignore Robb’s commands, and doesn’t calm down once they’re inside, to the point that Robb leaves him outside.

3. The Freys who ride out make a big deal about Jeyne not being there, about how much their father was looking forward to seeing her. Walder does the same thing once they get inside.

I know hindsight is 20/20 and they really needed Walder Frey, but it seems there’s a point at which they should have thought, “You know, these things together don’t bode well. We should cut our losses.” Cat in particular is usually very attuned to this kind of thing (see: point 1). Is the idea that guest right is so inviolable that they are/should be totally safe once they’ve eaten/drunk something? Is there anything Walder could have done in this lead-up that would have made Robb and co reconsider going inside?

My other question:

Say the Freys survived the war. Say a new king made it to the throne, be it a Stark or even Stannis, who is a big rule-follower. What societal repercussions would they face for violating guest right? Would they be shunned by people in general (more so than usual, I mean)?",asoiaf

"Now, before anyone tears me to shreds about why he should finish the series (I share the sentiment but have come to accept the strong possibility of it never occurring), let me clarify what I mean by this posing this question (doubt I'm the first to do have done it).

There are a GREAT deal of readers who have invested in the ASOIAF for years, even decades, who have spent countless hours speculating and theorising about how the both individual plot lines and the greater plot will unfold in the final two books should Mr. R.R. Martin ever finish them. The sheer amount of these theories, whether they be complex or fairly straightforward, well thought out of half-baked, concern the greater story or the more minor ones, have resulted in a following and a large, world-spanning  community that is rare (to say the least) amongst any works of fiction, let alone within the fantasy genre. 

One thing I have come to notice fairly quickly in my hours of scrolling through and reading countless theories and predictions is the sheer variety of them in their large number. There are other works of fiction for whom I hold great affection but the raw and unfiltered creativity that has shown itself within the ASOIAF community renders this same same qualities of the others pale in comparison. One thing that have come to realise more recently, especially following the conclusion of the show, is the way in which a lot of these theories (with a great number of them starkly contrasting to one another) fit so well within the world and tone of Martin's world and characters, whereas with other works of fiction theories tend to just be an extension of hopeful fan-fiction (of which the same sort is present within the ASOIAF community, as well).

As someone who has watched the show and has begun reading the books, I must say that one of the things I truly enjoy the most about the series is endlessly reading theories about characters I love, hate and even those who I haven't even read about yet. The point I'm getting at is that I'm sure there is a great deal of other people who feel the same way about the series and the vast amount of possibilities/directions it can go in from a storytelling point of view as I do and for those people I just want to share the same question that has been bugging me for quite some time now; do you really want to see the series concluded (answer is most likely yes and, if so, I agree) or do you find more joy in contemplating all the different in which the story COULD end? 

Granted, even if (hopefully) George R.R. Martin does end up finishing the series, the ending has a good chance of raising even more questions then there before and provide more points of speculation. Even so, and I'm being completely subjective here so don't take this as something in attempting to argue as being objective, there will be a great deal of what i love about the series that will be missing should the story ever reach its conclusion.

Tldr; Setting aside the obvious fact that most, if not all of us would like to see Martin's magnum opus reach its conclusion, do we really want to see that day if it means the end of so much fun and fascinating theorising and speculation?

Idk, just something that I thought would make for decent discussion. Could be wrong.

Note: Personally speaking, I adore George R.R. Martin both as a writer and as a person. In my opinion he has already given me and so many, many others great pleasure in reading his works and investing in his stories and characters that it doesn't matter whether he finishes his books or not because he has already given us so much. At the end of the day it all comes down to the fact that it's up to him how he lives his life and how he enjoys his immense success and I wouldn't have it any other way. I myself am very looking forward to Elden Ring, the upcoming FromSoftware dark fantasy game for which Martin provided the mythology of the story (it's also pretty neat that Martin got to work with Hidetaka Miyazaki, another amazing storyteller imo and who just happens to be a massive fan of Martin's works, in a medium completely seperate from the ones he has worked on before).",asoiaf
I still don’t understand why Martin split the fourth and fifth book by Geography. Do you think he regrets doing this? Maybe that’s why he certainly doesn’t plain to do the same for the 6th book?,asoiaf
"So recently I've seen posts based on what we've seen in the final season (Dany burning King's Landing even though the bells were ringing) that predict that, in the books, Jon Connington will be triggered by the bells (as he's traumatized by his failure at the Battle of the Bells) and as a result he'll do something reckless.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless of whether or not Connington will be triggered (if he hasn't died of greyscale yet), this connection to the Battle of the Bells got me thinking: what if Dany's burning of King's Landing is basically a second Battle of the Bells in which fAegon does what Robert Baratheon did in the original battle (hiding amongst the smallfolk) but Dany, instead of doing what Connington did (trying to find the target without hurting other people) decides to just burn King's Landing (which, IIRC, is what her father said Griff should had done). *EDIT: My mistake, it was actually Myles Toyne from the Golden Company who later told Connington that Tywin would have burned the town.*

&amp;#x200B;

Thinking about it, this makes sense. Even if Dany is angry and becomes ruthless, if fAegon is still at the Red Keep, Dany could just burn the Red Keep, there is no need to burn the whole city... unless fAegon isn't at the Red Keep but instead is hiding inside the city.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*EDIT: I agree with TheDustOfMen! I think Dany will intend to destroy only a part of King's Landing - either the part where she thinks fAegon is hiding and/or a random part to ""scare"" the smallfolk and force them to deliver fAegon to her (or force fAegon to surrender in order to stop her from destroying the rest of the city - hell, maybe she even says something like ""for every hour that passes I will burn a part of King's Landing until fAegon shows up"").* 

*By doing that, Dany will also intend to make the people fear her (since she won't be able to make them love her, she'll make them fear her). However, as TheDustOfMen has pointed out, this will backfire, as the dragon fire will actually ignite the wildfire hidden under the city, leading to most of King's Landing being burned. It's ironic that it was Dany's father who planted the wildfire to prevent the city from falling in the hands of the anti-Targaryens, and now this same wildfire will make things worse for the Targaryen restoration!*

*But even after things get out of control, I think Dany will still stand by her decision of sending Drogon to burn part of the city. She'll say that she would do it again if she had to, despite knowing the consequences. And it will be this ruthless mindset of Dany - this attempt at being feared since she couldn't be loved - that eventually will lead Jon to kill Dany. So the ""mad queen"" Daenerys won't actually be insane like her father was, instead she'll just try to be ruthless like Tywin was (and, as some people pointed out, Tyrion might be at fault for that, at least partially, depending on the kind of advices that he will give to her when he becomes her Hand).*

By the way, sorry for my bad English.",asoiaf
"George RR Martin originally wanted to end A Dance with Dragons with two battles. These are generally taken to be the Battles of Ice and Fire (not sure if even that much is confirmed). It's said that he decided to voluntarily remove one of them by himself, and then was later convinced to also remove the other by his editor.

Which do you think was removed first and which do you think he had to be talked into?

Apart from Jon's last chapter, ADwD ends with a long string of Mereen-centric chapters, which makes me wonder if a bunch of Winterfell chapters were cut very late on, or if they're there because he was building up to the Battle of Mereen right up to the end. From a story point of view, Winterfell and the Pink letter make a very good cliffhanger for the next book, so that may have factored into his decision.",asoiaf
"Throughout the history that we know of Westeros, there have been many events that seem to parallel each other through time. Different groups of men invade Westeros, up until Westeros is able to fight against them if the War of Ninepenny Kings could be viewed as such an invasion going awry. We see good Targaryens and bad Targaryens and ones who sit around doing little of anything. But I have a theory that events from the first Blackfyre Rebellion up until Robert's Rebellion may have been a chorus within the ""Song of Ice and Fire"", and what we see unfolding in the books is the chorus playing faster and a little bit out of order.

**The First Blackfyre Rebellion**

The First Blackfyre Rebellion was caused by Aegon IV legitimizing all of his bastards, of which he had many. Two of the the better known Blackfyres were Brynden and Aegor Rivers, half brothers whose mothers were from feuding Houses; the Blackwoods and the Brackens. We know them better as Bloodraven and Bittersteel.
Aegon IV, known as Aegon the Unworthy for his fall into lust and corruption. As a young man Aegon IV was handsome and skilled with the lance and the sword and was fond of hunting and more importantly, women, which lead to the birthing of the Great Bastards. 

The First Blackfyre Rebellion began when Daemon I Blackfyre, known earlier in life as Daemon Waters, rose up against his half brother Daeron II. The rebellion supposedly happened because Princess Daenerys, Daemon's half sister who he had wished to marry, was married off to a Dornish Prince.

The First Blackfyre Rebellion seems to parallel the Dance of Dragons, with the Dance having the Greens and the Blacks pitted against each other while the FBR had the Blacks and the Reds. It also seems like certain traits of both Aegon IV and Daemon Blackfyre are present in Robert Baratheon. Robert has Aegon's lust and fondness for hunting, while he has Daemon's motive for rebelling against the king; the woman he loves being out of his reach.

**Character Connections**

Several characters in the current books have traits similar to ""older characters"", and their actions seem to mirror this. I already mentioned Aegon IV, Daemon I Blackfyre and Robert Baratheon, but let's look at some others.

Robb Stark seems to parallel his uncle, Brandon, just as Ned seems to parallel his father Rickard Stark due both pairs going south and eventually dying their, although the causes are much different. Robb also has the apparent charm his uncle possessed. Ned also has similarities to Cregan Stark as both rode south during a time of uncertainty to become Hand, and both held the office for a brief time. It has been pointed out that Robb also has some similarities to Daeron the Young Dragon, both in youthful house titles and dying in their ""conquered"" land.

Bran has some parallel to Bloodraven with his ties to greensight. He also has some parallel with Benjen, being the young Stark left to rule Winterfell.

Jon has ties to both Ned and Benjen being the quiet counterpart to Robb and the Stark who joins the Night's Watch.

I probably could go on and on with some of these, but I won't because I know all of you are smart cookies who love this series as well and have likely noticed these types of connections before.

**Where am I going with this?**

My point for all of this is a prediction of where the series is headed based on the idea that these parallels support the concept that this is the ""Chorus"" of the Song of Ice and Fire, which I believe to be an analogy for history, specifically the history of humans. The Song of Ice and Fire is man against nature, and it has it's unique verses as well as it's choruses.

The prediction isn't specific, but it does revolve around one thing. I predict that by the end of the books, based on what we know from the show and these parallels, the world will oddly end in a state similar to which the series began.

Do you think that, in George’s ending, The Unsullied will end up in The Night’s Watch? (Assuming there is still a (valid) purpose for the NW.)

The Unsullied obviously won’t travel to Naath in the books because of butterfly fever and I feel like this would also fill one of the show’s many plot holes: “Who’s ensuring that Jon stays in the NW?” (I believe Jon being sent back to the NW is part of GRRM’s ending)

"I’m on my third re-read of the series and just finished ACOK and it just boggles my mind about how delusional and idiotic Theon actually is. I get that he’s torn between Greyjoy and Stark but damn. Everybody on Pike hates him for nothing basically, I mean the kid is taken when he’s 9 to live with a hostile family as a glorified hostage. I mean did the Greyjoy’s expect him to murder Eddard and escape back to Pyke? You’d think that with the starks basically integrating him with their own family and giving him all the courtesies that befits his rank he would think of the starks as more of a family in my opinion. 

Then he gets to Pike with Robb’s letter and suddenly he’s hellbent on becoming the heir to his fathers “Crown”. He takes Wintertell without even thinking about it really, he just saw the castle was the heart of the north and decided to act. Asha actually gave him a pretty good lesson about this talking about how the power of the Greyjoy’s are at sea but winterfell is in the dead of the north. The whole time in winter fell he’s just stupid, he doesn’t set a guard on bran and rickon, he doesn’t even search the entire castle first before going and searching for them. Even the murder of the two decoys didn’t make much sense because all it did was solidify the hate of the north towards him, surely his time with the starks must have taught him that the north is fiercely loyal to the starks so “killing” the the two princes basically did nothing but make everyone hate him even more. 

I just wanted to share this because I don’t see a lot of posts about Theon Greyjoy, also im discussing this before he’s taken by Ramsey, so any actions by him as “Reek” are excluded from this discussion.",asoiaf
"Inspired by [this exchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/80wwjp/spoilers_extended_why_is_bloodraven_never_talked/duz38vh/) I had a year ago. This is only half a shitpost...

Rhaegar was born of a line with significant Blackwood ties (Betha Blackwood being his great grandmother, but since his parents and grandparents are both sibling pairs, he had 50% Blackwood blood). As such Rhaegar is connected to both the First Men and the Targaryens.

Brynden Rivers was born of a line with significant Blackwood ties (Melissa Blackwood being his mother, so 50% Blackwood blood). As such Brynden is connected to both the First Men and the Targaryens.


---- 

Rhaegar was obsessed with prophecies, shared correspondence with Aemon, and was associated with GoHH, a Child of the Forest.

Brynden is heavily interested in prophecies, spent almost two decades with Aemon at the wall, and is working with Chidren of the Forest.

----

At one point Rhaegar was convinced that his son, Aegon, is TPTWP. He later went through great trouble to have another child (either another head of the dragon or a new candidate for TPTWP), and got killed as a consequence. 

At one point Brynden was convinced that his grand nephew, Aegon, has particular significance in the grand scheme of things.

&gt; ""What he is,"" said Bloodraven, ""is a dragon. Rise, ser."" 

He later went through great trouble to install Aegon on the throne, and got sent to the wall as a consequence. 

----

Rhaegar and his brutish second cousin both fell for Lyanna. Rhaegar got the girl, but this rivalry contributed to Robert's Rebellion.

Brynden and his brutish half-brother both fell for Shiera. Brynden got the girl, but this rivalry contributed to the Blackfyre Rebellions.

----

Robert killed Rhaegar near the end of the war, and later commented:

&gt; ""In my dreams, I kill him every night,"" Robert admitted. ""A thousand deaths will still be less than he deserves."" 

Bittersteel gouged Bloodraven's eye out at the end of the war. It is said that Bloodraven has *more than a thousand* eyes. 

----

Robert remained bitter after the victory, considered joining a sellsword company, and authorized attempts to exterminate the Targaryens.

Bittersteel remained *bitter* after the defeat, founded a sellsword company, and launched several more attempts to defeat the Targaryens.

(Also Robert was likened to steel, sigil colors, etc, but I digress)

---- 

Rhaegar died by (partly, Jon Connington's) values such as chivalry and honor:

&gt; ""[...] Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, Rhaegar fought honorably. And Rhaegar died.""

#

&gt; He was not wrong, Jon Connington reflected, leaning on the battlements of his forebears. I wanted the glory of slaying Robert in single combat, and I did not want the name of butcher. So Robert escaped me and cut down Rhaegar on the Trident. 

... while his opponent did not:

&gt; At the end they had the usurper hidden in a brothel. What sort of king was that, who would hide behind the skirts of women? 

Brynden lived by disregarding chivalry, reputation, and ""the glory of single combat""--raining arrows down on Daemon I Blackfyre, capturing Daemon II Blackfyre instead of fighting him in single combat, executing Aenys Blackfyre, etc.

... while his opponent did:

&gt; “So close a thing... if Daemon had ridden over Gwayne Corbray and left him to his fate, he might have broken Maekar’s left before Bloodraven could take the ridge. 

----

(Assuming B+S=M)

Rhaegar had a child by Lyanna. The child is unaware of his origins and thinks of Rhaegar as an enemy (of his adoptive father). 

Brynden had a child by Shiera. The child is unaware of her origins and thinks of Brynden as an enemy.

&gt; A face took shape within the hearth. Stannis? she thought, for just a moment... but no, these were not his features. A wooden face, corpse white. Was this the enemy? A thousand red eyes floated in the rising flames.",asoiaf
"This is the one aspect of Bran becoming king in the show (and presumably the books) that bugs me. Taboos and cultural attitudes towards things like kinslaying and guest right have always been an important factor for lords in the books. And while ""the Old Gods"" are rather tolerated in the South, *wargs and greenseers are definitely not.*

&gt;""Warg. Shapechanger. Beastling. That is what they will call you, if they should ever hear of your wolf dreams.""

...

&gt;Lord Janos was red-faced and quivering. ""The beast,"" he gasped. ""Look! The beast that tore the life from Halfhand. A warg walks among us, brothers. A WARG! This . . . this creature is not fit to lead us! This beastling is not fit to live!""

...

&gt;The free folk fear skinchangers, but they honor us as well. South of the Wall, the kneelers hunt us down and butcher us like pigs.

So it seems to me there is going to have to be a complete reversal of these thousand+ year old attitudes by the end of the series, probably out of gratitude for something Bran does (unlikely). Or Bran is going to have to keep his powers entirely undercover and win an election with zero claim entirely on his own non-supernatural merits (more likely, but still pretty unlikely).

How do you see this playing out? Is Bran going to change everyone's mind about this hated class of people? Or is he going to be a closeted greenseer king?",asoiaf
"You ever feel lonely?  Guys, you ever see a pretty girl, and smile, but she doesn't even look at you?  Then you see a group of pretty girls and just thinking about going up and talking to them makes 
you feel flushed and uncomfortable and your tongue ties up before you even try to speak?  You're self conscious -- you're a little short, teeth aren't great, you try to exercise but you're still pretty scrawny, your hair's receding a bit or you have acne, and maybe you've had some success with girls but you finally reach a point in your life when you just realize.....  I am not desirable?

You ever feel any of those feelings, even in passing, fleeting moments?  Can you recall, or imagine, how lonely that has made you feel?

Or have you ever done embarrassing things in your past, and you felt like your parents or siblings must have wanted to completely disown you?  You've got so many thoughts, you may be a bright guy who loves to learn and to read but you're just socially awkward for some reason that feels completely unfixable?

You ever think to yourself that life's not fair, that the odds are stacked against you, that there's so many things out there that you want that you know you'll never have -- most of all, you just want a little bit of love from someone who desires you?  But you remember all the things about yourself that make you undesirable?

I'm not complaining.  My life has turned out pretty decent.  I'm not ugly.  But I've certainly gone through those phases in my life when I feel like there's a hole in my life, and it's because of things I can't fix, and I'll never be able to fill that hole as full as I want it to be.

*That is Tyrion's entire life.*

I feel self conscious about my dumb hairline or my sub-average teeth or my thin arms when I talk to pretty girls.  But part of me knows it's all in my head.  Tyrion knows that everyone is looking at his height, his deformities, his mismatched eyes, and his new scar.  Can you imagine the extreme self-consciousness that he has?  Can you imagine going through life knowing that no one will ever feel sexual desire for you?  Knowing that you can never fix it or do anything about it?  In fact, they not only *not* desire him -- they're physically repulsed by him.  Can you imagine the only woman that shows genuine desire for you is a an ugly fat imp, like yourself, and knowing that she's better than you deserve?

Can you imagine how lonely and tortured he must be to live with that his entire life?

Then, throw onto that: you don't even have family to give you a hug.  They either want you dead, or they took away the one woman who ever actually showed you real affection.

Then throw onto *that*, that he has immense riches that should at least make it somewhat easier.  But no.  But even all the gold in the seven kingdoms does not earn Tyrion any desire or love.  All it does is put him in environments where the women are more desirable, but he himself is even less desirable by contrast.  His status actually makes his psychological needs *worse*.

This guy has to be the most lonely, angry, resentful human in Planetos, and how can we blame him?  I imagine that he feels roughly like school-shooters feel: bullied, unloved at home, never any romantic prospects to dream of, and finally, as of the end of ASoS, he has no real purpose in life either.  He at least was good at the game of thrones, before Joff was murdered.  He could at least hang his hat on that at the end of the night.

Now?  Floating through Essos, running away from assassins and slavers, he has less than nothing.

I'll come back to my analogy... that this is pretty much the psychology of a school shooter.  Poor family life, no romantic prospects, no work prospects, constantly bullied, shunned; someone who has nothing... and therefore nothing to lose.

And he's about to come home with dragons.

I'm a big proponent of the theory that Tyrion's going to push Dany, or mislead her somehow about the presence of wildfire in the city, and that he's ultimately the ""villain"" in the books, unlike his white-washed character in the show.  And just reflecting more on the actual mindset of this character... His story's even sadder than Catelyn's, to me.",asoiaf
"I just discovered that there are a bunch of graphic novels of ASOIAF. Wtf? Are they any good? Are they faithful to the original books? Is the art good? Is it worth buying?

Edit: Yeah I read it a little bit. It's kinda dull...",asoiaf
"I've long believed that between the Tully sisters, Lysa was simply screwed over by fate where Catelyn got lucky. Cat got to have a happy, loving marriage with a man close to her age and 5 healthy, happy children, whereas Lysa was saddled with an old man, a series of miscarriages and stillbirths and a frail, sickly child. Between her denied love, forced abortion, loveless marriage and the rest of it, its no wonder her mental health deteriorated and she became this obsessive, paranoid, jealous bitch. 

&amp;#x200B;

But then, something made me reconsider this view - I read that Catelyn had seen Lysa last some 5 years ago. Cat mentions how the last time she saw Sweetrobin was when he was less than a year old. Given his birth in 292 AC and the series starting in 297 AC, the timing fits. And yet, Catelyn never made any not of Lysa's deteriorating mental state before. 

&amp;#x200B;

This seems clear from how she thinks of her - Cat believes in and trusts Lysa. When Ned expresses doubt that Lysa's accusations might be coming from grief, Cat defends her, saying that the caution she'd exercised in delivering that letter showed that she was of sound mind and they should take it seriously. When Blackfish suggests that Lysa meant to rule Vale herself, Cat once again replies that a woman can rule just as well as a man. Cat is certainly not the type to willingly blind herself to her family's faults - just look at how she treats Edmure. And yet, she trusts Lysa's words completely. 

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, there is her obvious shock when she meets her at Eyrie. Catelyn's horror at what Lysa has become is laid out in great detail. And in Catelyn's own pov, we had absolutely no hint of this. All this tells me that Lysa had been relatively sane and stable the last time they met. That she'd given Catelyn no cause for concern and her transformation really did come out of nowhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

So where did it come from? Lysa was forced to give up her love and abort her child 15 years ago. She was married to a man old enough to be her father right about that time. She'd suffered through miscarriages and stillbirths and until 5 years ago, she'd still somehow managed to retain her sanity. So why now? Did something happen in the last 5 years that broke Lysa? 

&amp;#x200B;

As a matter of fact, something interesting did happen 5 years ago - *Littlefinger came to King's Landing.* And that, I believe is the real reason behind her insanity. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lysa had never been Catelyn - she is always described as having been somewhat silly and immature as a child. Even so, she was a Tully. She'd been taught the same things as Cat - to put her family and duty first. I believe that while Lysa hadn't exactly been happy in her marriage, she'd have resigned herself to her fate and decided to make the best of it. The while she never stopped loving Littlefinger, she she decided that loving him from afar was the best she could do and chose to focus on her family instead. Had Littlefinger never come to King's Landing, hers would've been a sad and tragic tale of a woman who gives up her happiness for sake of her family and duty - as so many women in Westeros are forced to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

But Petyr did come to KL and I think as soon as he got there, he got to work on bringing Lysa under his thumb. He knew that she'd be a valuable asset and he did whatever her had to to bring her under his thumb - gaslighting her, emotionally abusing her, threatening her - every psychological trick he could think of. Lysa of 5 years ago might've balked at the thought of anyone poisoning her husband - but Littlefinger got her to the point where she'd do it herself. She'd have put her family before everyone - but after LF was done with her, she was willing to lie to them and betray them. Lysa's complete mental breakdown is because of Petyr Baelish - because of his abuse in attempts to bring her under his control. While everything else Lysa had been through certainly contributed, she might've survived it all if not for Littlefinger.

"Hey everyone! I wanted to make post to discuss this Martin interview I found: 

&gt;""It was the summer of 1991. I was still involved in Hollywood. My agent was trying to get me meetings to pitch my ideas, but I didn’t have anything to do in May and June. It had been years since I wrote a novel. I had an idea for a science-fiction novel called Avalon. I started work on it and it was going pretty good, when suddenly it just came to me, this scene, from what would ultimately be the first chapter of A Game of Thrones. It’s from Bran’s viewpoint; they see a man beheaded and they find some direwolf pups in the snow. It just came to me so strongly and vividly that I knew I had to write it. I sat down to write, and in, like, three days it just came right out of me, almost in the form you’ve read.""

Hasn't Martin also implied that things about the ending can be found in the first chapter before? This combined with that fact that his three day draft of it while having nothing else to go off of yet is ""almost the form"" we've read got me thinking and I re-read the first chapter.

Ultimately what I ended up thinking is what if at the end of the story Bran has to execute Jon for abandoning the Night's Watch? Jon is revived and abandons his post at the Night's Watch to save the realm or simply because he recognizes his vows are fulfilled. The rest of the story happens, Jon either never learns his family heritage or he does and turns down the Iron Thrones/never reveals it to the public, and eventually through a great council or conquest or some other politicking Bran ends up on the throne. However, either at the Great Council or through some other circumstance some of the lords start talking about how ""Hey, that bastard of Ned Stark's, he abandoned the Night's Watch."" Because how would anyone is the realm truly believe he could come to life. Bran in his first act as the newly chosen child King who many'a lords probably do not trust quite yet, rather than pardon an oathbreaker, executes Jon. Bran does it himself, taking in the lesson Ned passes to him in the first chapter that the man who sentences someone must look him in the eye and hear his final words.

Alternates/tinfoil time: If Bran is a malevolent CotF greenseer hivemind download like some people think, then this ending is even **more** interesting. Bran knows Jon to be innocent of any crime, yet in the first act as king both proves that he is willing to uphold the law to the lords even when it requires something as ""difficult"" as sacrificing family, and also in one swing of the sword kills the true heir to the throne, ending the Targaryen line and any legitimate opposition to his claim on the Iron Throne.

Or the lords call on Bran for Jon's execution and arranges for him to be smuggled out, perhaps to the Watch/North of the Wall. Timeskip and the epilogue of DoS he is found out, and Bran has his own son watch the execution. This mirrors the first chapter better but that's the only reason I thought it. Also would Bran really ever be apathetic enough to execute his brother rather than just pardon him and then get the lord's trust in other ways.

TL;DR: George thought of the first chapter before anything else in the series. Also says stuff like ""the ending can be found in the beginning."" What if at the end King Bran executes Jon Snow as an oathbreaker for abandonment of the Night's Watch?",asoiaf
"I personally believe it is Robb,as when leading the stark armies he was able to achieve countless small victories against the Lannisters and also win several major engagements (Whispering Wood,Oxcross etc) and he could have won the war if not for his many political blunders and gaps in judgement.",asoiaf
"In his memoir *On Writing*, Stephen King recalls advice he got form his editor during his first professional writing job as a highschooler covering sports news for a local paper:

&gt;""When you're writing a story, you're telling yourself a story,"" he said. ""When you rewrite, your main job is taking out all the things that are *not* the story.""

This was a lesson we had repeated to us during my years of grad school getting an MFA in creative writing (an education that makes you better at talking about writing than actually writing, at least in my experience), but there seems to be a counterpoint that I haven't really seen explored much. While taking out everything that is not the story seems to be advocating for minimalism, or at least a strong since of parsimony with the text, there are also tremendous works of literature that have gone in the opposite direction, towards maximalism.

Maximalist texts are those which seem to throw in every single detail and tangent imaginable. We don't know just that the hobbits are singing while leaving the Shire, or even just learn the lyrics to the song (*home is behind, the world ahead*), but learn that Bilbo wrote the lyrics to a tune he'd previously learned from the Elves and then taught the song to Frodo who taught it to the others. The Iliad recounts the details of the deaths, it seems, of nearly every person killed during the tenth year of the Trojan War, including far too many people specified as having been speared in the crotch. GRRM lets us know in savoring detail exactly what Lady Tanda is serving for dinner each and every damn evening.

During grad school, and for several years after, I thought of minimalism and maximalism as simply two different stylistic choices. We can enjoy a simple and easy ""just the facts ma'am"" story, and many stories prosper from the lightness of their text. At the same time, maximalism can be equally enjoyable, especially when we're placed in a fantastical world we want to dwell in for as long as possible.

I think to a certain extent this is right, and the degree of detail included is largely a stylistic choice. But, after letting the issue stew, rereading Thrones and Clash again, and having not an insignificant number of Hazy Little Things (dear Sierra Nevada, I'm looking for a sponsor), I think there's more to it, and at least as far as ASOIAF is concerned the style and story are intrinsically linked.

**All The Things *Are* The Story**

What if maximalism was not the counterpoint to the principle of removing everything that isn't the story, and is instead a different manifestation of that principle? What if the story is pears poached in wine, and savory fish rolled in salt and cooked crisp, and capons stuffed with onions and mushrooms, and great loaves of brown bread, and mounds of turnips and sweetcorn and pease, and immense hams, and roast geese, and trenches of venison and barley stew, and cream swans, and spun-sugar unicorns, and lemon cakes, and spiced honey biscuits, and blackberry tarts, and apple crisps, and wheels of buttery cheese? What if that can't be removed because *that is the story?*

It's easy to think of the Song of Ice and Fire as being chiefly about the Others and the dragons and the Prince That Was Promised, as being about Dany and Jon and Arya's journey to become a Faceless Man and Bran becoming the Three Eyed Raven, and all the other goings on of the high lords and their Game of Thrones and the War for the Dawn. Certainly the story is about all that, but it might also be about the disparity in wealth between Lady Tanda's table and flea bottom pot-shops. It might also be about the fact that Rodrik Cassel's brother had four sons, only Jory reaching adulthood, and Rodrik himself only having daughters. It might be about the butcher's boy.

While it will probably matter a great deal what children Rhaegar Targaryen fathered, it matters to Rodrik Cassel what children *he* has. Who (if anyone) eventually lands with Sansa matters, but so does who ends up with Lollys Stokeworth after her tragedy in the riot of King's Landing.

ASOIAF is about the fact that all these things matter. Robb seeking vengeance against the Lannisters for a once-in-a-generation travesty matters, but so do Mirri Maz Duur's vengeance against the Dothraki for their everyday savagery. One gate guard with a grudge, or a drinking habit, or a gambling problem, or a plain old fire in his loins can make as much difference as a high lord. This isn't a world just of kings and queens; it's a world of *everyone*, and only a maximalist style can accommodate that idea.

**A Caveat**

None of this is to say that maximalism always reflects the intent of a story, or that this is the only thing maximalism can do. I haven't read Lord of the Rings in some time so I haven't really thought much about it in this way, but I don't think it's about emphasizing the importance of mundane folk. I'm actually not really sure what to make of the style there. Same with The Iliad, I haven't read it since college (and gods, that was... 15 years ago?), though [Lindybeige](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aofPdMbXzUQ) has some thoughts.

But, when it comes to ASOIAF, I think maximalism is doing a lot more work than simply fleshing out the world. It's telling us what to think about it.

And if you like being told what to think in obscenely long-winded manner, you'll love [The Quill and Tankard](http://quillandtankard.com/)!",asoiaf
"That little finger was Lysa’s lover/got raped and impregnated her? It seems like during Robert’s Rebellion, Hoster Tully agreed to fight for Robert with one of the conditions being that Jon takes Lysa as his wife. It also seems like Jon knew that he would be taking a ‘soiled’ wife as Hoster mentioned something about how Lysa should be grateful that such a great lord would agree to take her as his wife despite losing her virginity. 

Accompanied with the fact that littlefinger immediately got exiled from riverrun and that probably people would gossip, surely Jon would’ve suspected something. And if he did, why is it that he agreed to Lysa’s suggestion of hiring him in the Vale/Gulltown and bringing him along to King’s Landing as well?

" 

There's a couple of things that have stuck out in what I've read so far:

\-Specifically with regard to Janos Slynt, it seems like there's a pretty elitist undercurrent in why he chose to send him to the Wall. He and Tywin both seemed pretty hung up on Joffrey giving him Harrenhal (which in fairness IS pretty weird), but it seemed like he was punished for daring to imagine himself superior, as much as it was an attempt for Tyrion to load the Gold Cloaks with someone loyal to him.

\-If Tyrion was so concerned about what a mess Cersei and Joffrey were making of things... why not just put them under house arrest? The Gold Cloaks were loyal to him, he had his Hill Tribesmen, and the Lannister household guard were sworn to prioritize his orders over Cersei's. Tywin gave him a clear mandate to do whatever he needed in order to restore order in King's Landing and rein in Joffrey's excesses, and he had enough evidence just walking in the door that Joffrey was having some Caligula-esque tendencies and that Cersei was both a thorn on his side and completely useless.",asoiaf
"Rereading A Storm of Swords, it’s amazing how many times the rules of guest right are mentioned in the first few hundred pages, to the point where it seems almost obvious that a large plot point will have something to do with it. We also get the story of the Reynes of Castamere multiple times as well,  so when Cat hears the band start playing it we immediately know that something is wrong.",asoiaf
"I’ve started reading the books, on ASOS now, and hearing about the *horn of Joramun* capable of bringing the wall down made me think of the others. This would be a simple way to get them past but precedented and still pretty epic. 

No need to force a dragon past the wall or any of that, Bran sees this horn exists in some vision and starts running as the others make their match. They come for him too and queue hold the door and Bran running.",asoiaf
"In AGOT Tyrion reflects on how if he weren’t born a Lannister he might have ended up in a slavers grotesquery. Then in ADWD this is actually what happens to him. 

In ACOK Arya notices Elmar Frey who’s crying over not being able to marry a princess. When she tries to console him and tells him she’s learned that her brothers have recently been killed, he rudely says no one cares about some servants brothers. Then Arya answers back with a rude comment about the stupid princess he was supposed to marry. Neither of them being aware that SHE was that princess. 

In ADWD Stannis tells Jon, “you haggle like a crone with a codfish lord Snow. Did lord Eddard father you on some fish wife?” Then later, Godric Borell tells Davos that Ned slept with a fisherman’s daughter, who gave him Jon Snow. Then after negotiating with Tycho Nestoris, Jon thinks back on what Stannis said, “perhaps he had”.

"1. First of we know Tyanna was a sorceress and we know sorcery has given characters unnatural lifespans  in the book series e.g Brynden Rivers the three eyed raven , Melissandre the red priestess...

2 Tyanna was mentioned as an orphan Tavern Dancer ,who rose to become a very powerful courtesan in Pentos...          Taena is also a dancer the closest thing to Shakira and Kim Kardashian in the series lol. 
 At Joffrey's wedding she made a statement with her provocative spinning and performance... ""Soon all the male eyes in the hall were on her as she spurn provocatively"". 

3 They were both described as Raven haired black beauties... 

4 Both chyked a queen ,Taena fucked Cercei ,Tyanna fucked Alys Harroway.. 
5 Both are ruthless and willing to frame Innocents for crimes they know nothing of.. Taena framed Selene and swore by all the gods in Essos and Westeros under oath that she saw Tyrion put something in Joffrey's cup..

"Just curious because I never got the hype about him. I've read a bit on some theories people have about Euron's plan and I just don't see how any of it is going to work out. I don't think bringing about an apocalypse is something that fits in the ASOIAF style, and the dragonbinder seems like nothing more than a really obvious cursed gift to get Victarion killed. His major accomplishments in the books are convincing a bunch of xenophobic idiots to follow him at the kingsmoot, and taking the Shields after a sneak attack while the Reach's armies are on the other side of the continent.

So why do you guys think he's going to be important to the endgame, and how is he going to actually achieve his plans?",asoiaf

"EDIT: Just to clarify, I'm not talking about people in this sub. Most of the concern is with mainstream media starting to bash the show and then the mainstream audience following suit. I should have been more clear.

&amp;#x200B;

When season 8 came to a close, it seemed like the amount of people criticising the show had substantially increased. I guess this is mostly due to people not liking the ending because ""the writing in season 8 was bad"". But c'mon, the show's writing hasn't been good since season 4.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since the show deviated from the books, the quality of writing has been consistently bad (with exception to a few characters &amp; plot lines). The only reason these people didn't like the writing in season 8 compared to seasons 5, 6 &amp; 7 is because they didn't get the ending they wanted. They got upset because the ending wasn't satisfying to them, and jumped aboard the bandwagon, using the guise of ""bad writing"" to express their grievances.

&amp;#x200B;

All of a sudden, a new wave of people were criticising the writing. And I initially thought, great, the mainstream fan base has finally realised the faults of the recent seasons. But this isn't the case, their main issue is with season 8. I'm not trying to say what people can and can't like, if you like the latter half of the show then great. But at least be consistent.

&amp;#x200B;

While I agree that seasons 5, 6 &amp; 7 are a tiny bit better than season 8, they're still pretty much on the same level. I don't understand how you can be content with season 7 but hate season 8. Where were these people during season 5?, which had one of the worst plot lines in the show. It just seems like bandwagoning to me.

"I don't know if this was posted before but here we go. I love characters always being informed on important events, and seeing their reactions.

Tywin's reaction to Jaime's hand:

Lord Tywin pushed himself out of his chair, breath hissing between his teeth. “Who did this?If Lady Catelyn thinks—”

“Lady Catelyn held a sword to my throat and made me swear to return her daughters. This was your goat’s work. Vargo Hoat, the Lord of Harrenhal!”

Lord Tywin looked away, disgusted. 

In the show, Tywin's reaction to Jaime's hand is removed.

Tyrion's reaction to Jaime's hand:

""Oh, gods,"" he said. ""Jaime, I am so sorry, but . . . gods
be good, look at the two of us. Handless and Noseless, the Lannister boys.""


In the show, nothing.


||


We see JonCon's reaction to Tywin's death

“Tywin Lannister dead? At your hand?”


“At my finger. This one.” Tyrion held it up for Griff to admire.


“Have no fear, I won’t kill you, you are no kin of mine. Might I see what the cheesemonger wrote? I do love to read about myself.”


In the show, Tyrion could've have similar conversation with Jorah at least.

In Feast, Cercei learns about Tyrion's escape after she learns Tywin's death, and we see Cercei panicking from Tyrion, in the show, she has no reaction to Tyrion escaping. 


||


Viserion dies, which is horrifying, and we got no reaction from Tyrion &amp; Varys &amp; Grey Worm.


||


Bran tells Wall has fallen and Night King has a dragon, which means the enemy who is impossible to defeat is now 100 times a bigger threat. What's the reaction of Jon &amp; Dany? They just look each other. 


||


Theon's reaction to Ramsay's death? Nothing.
||


Asha's reaction to Theon's death? Nothing.


||


Anyone's reaction to Dany's death other than Jon? Nah.

Jon is a Targaryen. Sansa's, Arya's, Tyrion's reactions? Nothing. It is for the best of course, D&amp;D would've write something cringe anyway.

House Frey is destroyed in a single night, reaction of anyone? No. No one even mentioned it. 

There is hundreds of more examples. First season wasn't so bad, we got Jon&amp;Robb&amp;Bran reactions to what was happening in KL etc. But specially after season 2, not much.

When you read the books, you see characters always informed on important events, we even see Tyrion's reaction to Stannis going to the Wall hearing it from Illyrio etc. I love this interactions so much. And in the show, nothing. I understand if something is costly, and they dont have the budget. But this is just dialogue. And makes me angry that characters dont give any reactions. D&amp;D dont care about characters interacting, they just wanted to tell the story as fast as possible and be done with it.",asoiaf
"Hearing my nephew listen to the new (somewhat) song by Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus, had me thinking about the current Oldtown plot. While it doesn't get as much attention as the **Battle of Ice/Battle of Fire** or even the **attack on Storm's End**, the numerous characters/plots centered around Oldtown are extremely fascinating (at least to me).

I wanted to take some time to discuss the current plots/characters and possible outcomes of what will certainly be one of the most interesting parts of the intro to **The Winds of Winter**

***

I thought for awhile about the best way to break this down and no way seemed to work perfectly so I thought it would be best to do a list of characters then plotlines then outcomes:

#Characters:

**The Citadel**: Samwell Tarly, Alleras/Sarella, Leo Tyrell, numerous Archmaesters, ""Pate""

**Recently Left**: Marwyn (aboard the *Cinammon Wind*, headed to Slaver's Bay)

**Ironborn Fleet**: Euron/Aeron/Falia Flowers/Falia Flower's bastard/Pyat Pree

**Redwyne Fleet**: Led by Paxter Redwyne, the fleet is en route to Oldtown to deal with the Ironborn

**The Brave Companions**: a small band led by Urswyck the Faithful (and possibly including Three Toes, Togg Joth and Zollo) is headed to Oldtown or already there

**The Hightowers**: Leyton/Malora the Mad Maid/Garth/Baelor

***

#Current plotlines/goings ons/questions:

1)**The Sphinx is the riddle and not the riddler**: Is this in relation to Alleras/Sarella? Why does Aemon mention it?

2)**Sam/dragonhorn**: Why does the horn get mentioned so often? What will Sam learn at the Citadel?

3)**Euron's blood sacrifice**: What is Euron summoning (kraken/dragon/sea dragon/drowned god/cthulhu type creature)? Will it work? Who all dies? Does he have anymore dragon eggs? Who/what is he working for?

4)**Leyton/The Mad Maid**: Why hasn't Leyton left the Hightower in a decade? What book of spells are he and Malora looking at? Does he have a glass candle? Why haven't we met Leyton yet (he's the biggest Lord we haven't met by far)?

5)**The Faceless Men**: Are they working with Euron? Why did they need a dragon egg? What are they going to to with *The Death of Dragons* once they acquire it?

6)**Glass Candles**: The only known glass candles in Westeros are in Oldtown. Does Leyton Hightower have one? Did Marwyn take one with him to Slaver's Bay? What type of magic is involved?

7)**Aftermath**: Who wins the battle and which major characters die? (It seems Aeron (after 2 or more POV's) is marked for death and Sam will be our lone POV in this area.) Where does the victor/main characters head after the Oldtown plot is over?

8)**Minor Characters**: How will the minor characters affect the plot, if at all (Urswyck, Leyton, etc.)? 

***

#Prophecies/Visions that could possibly be about Oldtown:

Dany's vision in THOTU (possible):

&gt;Then phantoms shivered through the murk, images in indigo. Viserys screamed as the molten gold ran down his cheeks and filled his mouth. A tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair stood beneath the banner of a fiery stallion, a burning city behind him. Rubies flew like drops of blood from the chest of a dying prince, and he sank to his knees in the water and with his last breath murmured a woman's name. . . . mother of dragons, daughter of death . . . Glowing like sunset, a red sword was raised in the hand of a blue-eyed king who cast no shadow. A cloth dragon swayed on poles amidst a cheering crowd. **From a smoking tower, a great stone beast took wing, breathing shadow fire**. . . . mother of dragons, slayer of lies . . . Her silver was trotting through the grass, to a darkling stream beneath a sea of stars. A corpse stood at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, grey lips smiling sadly. A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness. . . . mother of dragons, bride of fire . . . -ACOK, Daenerys IV

Mel's vision's at the Wall (probable):

&gt;Visions danced before her, gold and scarlet, flickering, forming and melting and dissolving into one another, shapes strange and terrifying and seductive. She saw the eyeless faces again, staring out at her from sockets weeping blood. **Then the towers by the sea, crumbling as the dark tide came sweeping over them, rising from the depths.** Shadows in the shape of skulls, skulls that turned to mist, bodies locked together in lust, writhing and rolling and clawing. Through curtains of fire great winged shadows wheeled against a hard blue sky. -ADWD, Melisandre I

and

&gt;""Some may."" Could the skulls in her vision have signified this bridge? Somehow Melisandre did not think so. ""If it comes, that attack will be no more than a diversion. **I saw towers by the sea, submerged beneath a black and bloody tide. That is where the heaviest blow will fall**."" -ADWD, Melisandre I

***

#Extra info:

- Well it hasn't been explicitly stated that Sam will return as a POV, it seems likely he will

- GRRM confirmed that Aeron would have more than one chapter in TWOW:

&gt;**Question**: With the use of the word ""the"", are you implying that there will only be one Damphair chapter in WINDS?

&gt;**GRRM**: No. -SSM, Baltimore and NYC: 6/12/2016

http://grrm.livejournal.com/490176.html?thread=24623296#t24623296

- We can also expect to see Willas/Garlan Tyrell at some point in TWOW, so do they come down to Oldtown or does Sam head to Highgarden after the battle?

- fAegon and the Golden Company ""still have friends in the Reach"". Who are these friends and does it affect Oldtown at all?

"**Tyrion's ending, where he becomes Hand of the King again and does the dirty work of ruling the ~~Seven~~ Six Kingdoms, is one that most people are not too bothered by. Here's why those people are wrong.**

1) **Tyrion began the series unloved.** Tyrion's entire life has been defined by the fact that his mother died giving birth to him, his father and sister despised him, and his one attempt at settling down with Tysha (who was a prostitute Jaime paid in the show, but in the books was actually a genuinely in love commoner) ended with her being sent away at his father's behest, but not before she got brutally gang-raped in front of him. So Tyrion fills the hole in his heart as best he can with alcohol and prostitution. 

**Tyrion ends the series still unloved, but with a bunch more of the people he loved dead.** Shae, who unlike in the books genuinely loved Tyrion, is dead. His entire family is dead. His monster sister (yes, she is a monster, sorry Tyrion) is no great loss. But Jaime was the only person within Tyrion's nuclear family who actually cared about Tyrion in his youth and treated him decently. And by setting him free from captivity Tyrion sent him to his death. Tommen, Myrcella, and Kevan, Tyrion's other decent family members, are dead.  Daenerys, who Tyrion apparently was in love with ([yes, really](https://io9.gizmodo.com/peter-dinklage-says-tyrion-has-the-hots-for-the-mother-1828862875)), is dead. His close friend Varys is dead.

And there are no real prospects that this situation will change in the future. Sansa, who we were given some vague hints might get back together with him in the last season, might as well be dead. He's the chief vizier, she's the queen of an independent realm whose subjects hate Lannisters. It's politically impossible. So I guess he's stuck hanging out with Pod and Bronn, trying to pay for prostitutes in a destroyed city with the money he doesn't have because Casterly Rock has no gold left. No wonder brothel reconstruction is such a high priority.

2) **Tyrion begins the series unappreciated.** Tyrion is, besides maybe Tywin, the most capable administrator in the series. Throughout the series he has ended up in numerous positions of responsibility, and at least early in the series before everyone caught the stupid plague he excelled. Military command? Tyrion can do it! Coinage and finance? Tyrion can do it! Intrigue and outmaneuvering malicious political factions? Tyrion can do it! Plumbing... you get the picture. 

Yet no one appreciates this work Tyrion does and they always attribute it to someone else, and blame Tyrion for anything that goes wrong. Tyrion is viewed as the ""twisted demon monkey"" who makes beloved Joffrey do cruel things and then murders him for his child wife's approval. Tywin gives him zero praise for his success in S2 and instead focuses on his whoring and drinking. Even Daenerys does nothing but scold Tyrion for inadequate performance, which isn't even that inadequate. How could he have known Euron could teleport? Or that the Tyrell army was completely worthless?

**In his ""new role"" (chief advisor to a child ruler, the exact same one he had in S2) Tyrion will still most likely be blamed for everything bad the new king does, and receive no credit for anything positive.** Nothing has changed. Tyrion will remain in the shadows, trying to do the hard work of ruling for a child psychopath who is fine with the deaths of thousands (but a cold, emotionless one this time instead of an impulsive one).

3) **Tyrion began the series with the childhood dream of having a dragon.** In the books this is much more important to him and indeed is probably 60% of the reason he's going to Meereen (along with 40% revenge and 0% whatever ""building a better world"" means). **He ends the series with all the dragons dead or disappeared, and he never got to ride one once.** Seriously, *Tormund Giantsbane and Sandor Clegane* got to ride a dragon and Tyrion didn't once because screw him I guess. This is a bit pettier than the other two but it bothers me anyway.

In conclusion, **show Tyrion's ending is not bittersweet but just bitter, besides ""Lord of a gold mine with no gold in it"" he gets essentially none of what he wants and is condemned to spend the rest of his life ""fixing his mistakes.""** Mistakes that stemmed mostly from Daenerys' inexplicable psychotic break when she was at the cusp of complete victory. If it's what GRRM intends for his favorite character that he's spent more pages on and more thoroughly developed than anyone else, then that strikes me as very odd.",asoiaf

"The show in my opinion, especially for the first 4 seasons, nailed Stannis’s stubbornness and his unyielding nature and really showed that he was the most determined man on the planet who would stop at nothing to take what in his mind was his right to rule.

But what they skipped over was something that the book eluded to which was his vulnerabilities one of which being his envy of his older brother Robert.

Always overshadowed by Robert and not as loved by the small folk or family or the lords of Westeros.  

Stannis I believe from a young age began to resent this and instead of moulding himself to be like Robert his stubborn nature made him into the opposite of his older brother.

Donal Noye said-

  “*Robert was the true steel,Stannis is iron. Black and strong but brittle. That one will break before he bends.*”

Donal Noye was master armourer for the Baratheon and was rumoured to have had crafted Robert’s famous Warhammer. He was the representation of the small folk and look at his opinion of Stannis. Maybe not negative but valued less than Robert.

Maester Cressen in the Prologue while being shunned by Stannis thinks back on the Baratheon brothers when they were young boys- 

“*Stannis, my lord, my sad sullen boy, son I never had, you must not do this, don’t you know how I cared for you, lived for you, loved you despite all? Yes, loved you, better than even Robert, or Renly, for you were the one unloved, the one who needed me most.*”

Cressen has been with Stannis for most of his life and has seen Stannis time and time again overshadowed by Robert. 

He even remarks by saying - “*Whatever Stannis did, Robert did first. And better*”.

Stannis is everything people say he is. Harsh, uncompromising and single minded. But he also is just a young boy who wanted to be like his big brother. Who wanted people to love him but didn’t know how to love. Who became resentful because of this but even so did his duty by his house and his family. 

I would of loved instead of Shireen being a plot device for shock by having her gruesomely killed by Stannis, actually be the rock that the wave of utter determination and destructive nature of Stannis breaks on. 

Stannis could be pushed to his limits as he is in the books now, snowed in with troops dying by the day, his claim being forgotten and Melisandre or his wife who hates Shireen says to offer kings blood, his daughter, to R’hollor for salvation. But Stannis rejects her and grabs her by the throat and tells them “*Never. God or glory or snow will never compel me to betray my daughters love. She is Princess Shireen of House Baratheon, the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. Not some by-blow of Roberts or abomination of incest. Marked by disease she is but I would dare the next God or man who tells me she is not worthy. She has always been worthy and you would do well to remember that when she rules in my place.*”

Shireen’s grey marked face is Stannis’s envy of Robert and Robert’s supposed superiority . A beautiful innocent young girl with true power yet they look at her with pity, disgust and dismiss her at every turn. 

This could have made Stannis one of the best written tv characters ever.",asoiaf
"I've been re-reading AGoT after completing the whole series a few years ago and I just finished Tyrion's trial by combat, and on a second read through it really struck me just how terrible Cat and Lysa are.

First, the letter from Lysa that Cat burned. In the chapter she receives it she reads and burns it before telling Ned what it says. She tells Ned that her sister said that ""the Lannisters"" killed Jon Arryn. In one of her POV chapters at the Eyrie she recalls that the letter explicitly blamed *Cersei* individually and not the Lannisters collectively.

And in Lysa's last chapter in ASoS, she tells Petyr and therefore us, that she poisoned Jon Arryn. In AGoT she acts fearful that Cat brought Tyrion to the Eyrie, and then in the trial scenes she acts like she believes Tyrion is responsible for Jon's death when she knows *for a fact* that he isn't.

And of course Cat blames Tyrion for the attack on Bran even though she has no proof and he had no motive, because Littlefinger lied and told Cat that he lost the dagger to Tyrion after Tyrion bet against Jamie in a tournament. And neither Cat nor Lysa even tells Tyrion or anybody *why* they believe Tyrion assaulted Bran or *why* they believe Tyrion killed Jon Arryn.

Why didn't they say anything? Because again, *they both knew he was innocent of both accusations.* They were both prepared to either kill Tyrion or let him die, and Cat was willing to start a war against the Lannisters while her husband was surrounded by Lannisters over abducting, imprisoning, and nearly kiling a man she *knew* to be innocent!",asoiaf
"I've been reading ASOIAF for the first time in my life. I love the series so far and I've been tryna read as much as I can. But about 680 pages in I read the most satisfying thing I will ever read. The death of Joffrey. I never knew I could smile such a huge smile at a person choking to death, but now I know.",asoiaf
"Imagine if the Greatjon had done his famous KitN speech (or at least a similar speech) after the Battle of the Bells, which was the first military victory during the rebellion in which northern forces were involved (and before Robert was acclaimed King by the rebels). 


The circumstances were quite similar to the situation when Robb marched south sixteen years later: The King had just murdered the Lord of Winterfell, making his son the new Lord at a young age, who then marches south to get justice. In AGoT this was enough for the northerners to declare independence after they had won a great victory, declaring Robb their King.


But House Targaryen’s crimes were even worse than those of the Lannisters. Aerys not only killed Ned’s father, but his elder brother as well, and even asked for Ned’s head. Not to mention that his heir kidnapped Ned’s sister! It’s hard to imagine how peace could be possible under these circumstances, certainly not as long as either House Stark or House Targaryen exist. 


So if the Greatjon did his speech, is there any reason why the northern Lords wouldn’t be in favor of independence and acclaim Ned King in the North, like they did with Robb? As I said, this is before Robert has been acclaimed King by the rebels, so that shouldn’t be a problem. If it happened, what would be the consequences for the rebellion, as well as for Westeros in the long term? What would Ned’s reaction be? 


Would the other rebel Kingdoms follow suit, and acclaim their Lords independent Kings? I could see Robert liking the idea of being declared Storm King, but what about Jon Arryn and Hoster Tully? While the Arryns are an old royal House like the Starks, the same can’t be said for the Tullys. Would the Riverlands then join the Stormlands or the Vale, like they joined the North in AGoT? What effect would this have on the Lannisters and Tyrells? 


If the Seven Kingdoms broke apart in in the wake of Robert’s Rebellion, would Westeros be better off by the time AGoT starts (fifteen years later), or worse?",asoiaf

Obvious answer is Bronn cause he definitely won’t be Lord of Highgarden with that many Tyrells kicking around in the books rather just a minor Lord of some random castle but who else do you think has a totally different endgame? 

I feel like the big 6 have more or less the same endings (Dany, Jon, Tyrion, Sansa, Bran and Arya) with better context. 

I also have a hard time seeing Sam as Grand Maester but he is GRRM’s self insert so who knows.

"I am not a native English speaker and Asoiaf is the first formal English literature I have read. I haven’t finished all the books yet but there were some lines that oddly got stuck in my head so far.

The first is in the prologue of AGOT, when the ranger said ‘the wall was weeping’, and I immediately was struck by how brilliantly that word is used here. ‘Weeping’ ... 

And the atmosphere is downright amazing, the word ‘dead’ is mentioned so many times while the forest itself seems alive, ‘the trees rustled like living things’, ‘leaves whispered past them’...and I seriously held my breath when the dead ranger opened his eyes and strangled the alive one.

This chapter got me hooked on the series and I knew I was in for a wild ride.

The second thing that got stuck in my head is when describing Mel looking into the fire for visions, ‘sweat traced her skin like a lover’s hand’, which again, I thought about the sentence and was in awe of how vivid that is at portraying the image of her in pain, focused, trying to read into the fire. It really got stuck in my head in an odd way.

Maybe I’m just very easily impressionable but these minor things really make me marvel at how brilliant the writer is.",asoiaf
"An oft-repeated criticism of S8E6 has been that Bran's government is bound to collapse almost immediately. Multiple High Lords on the council have reason to secede, especially in light of Sansa's announcement that the North is going to do just that. Another complaint is that it's effectively a Stark coup.

However, I'd argue that these assertions don't go far enough. Bran's government isn't merely about to collapse, it's completely impotent from day one. The other lords don't secede because there's no point; Bran's government effectively creates seven independent kingdoms.

# The Inception

The other High Lords show up because of the threat of Daenerys' army. They are battle-hardened, have taken multiple cities, and even before they arrived in Westeros had a reputation for fierceness (""A DOTHRAKI HORDE ON AN OPEN FIELD""). Along with the Starks' army, they *could* be a real threat.

However, it quickly becomes obvious that the Dothraki and the Unsullied aren't there to play the game of thrones, and they aren't on friendly terms with the Starks. Rather, they're only there to act as stewards and ensure a peaceful transition of power in honor of Daenerys' memory.

This leaves the Starks. The Starks' army is the second most powerful force in KL, and the Council of Lords is chock full of Starks or Stark supporters. It's patently unfair, but the Starks also have their whole army there.

But then a very curious thing happens. Tyrion, the traitor to Westeros demeans Bran with the moniker ""the Broken"". Bran's sister utterly humiliates Bran in front of everyone there by announcing that he's loosing blanks - or not loosing at all. And Bran, heir to Winterfell, the man who ought to be liege lord of the army that just massacred King's Landing does...absolutely nothing about it. Tyrion blathers about Bran being a storyteller, rulers being chosen. Well, everybody is stuck going along with it, because of the implication (that the Starks might murder everybody under a flag of truce, like they did to King's Landing).

But then an even more curious thing happens. Bran's sister announces that she's taking the North independent...and now things start to come into focus. See, this means Bran doesn't have an army. On top of that, Tyrion is appointed as his Hand. A man whose own house hates him, who most recently sided with a foreign army that massacred a major city center, who somehow got their army to hate him too.

So of course nobody says anything. What's obviously happened is that Sansa (who wants to be undisputed ruler of the North) and Tyrion (who just wants to be left alone) have set up a nominal central government, with no power. There is nothing in King's Landing and nobdy appointed to the government has any power. The tit-for-tat that's in effect is that Sansa is getting autonomy in exchange for arranging the same for every other kingdom.

In essence, Bran's position is now analogous to the position of the Queen of England, but with even less of a role in practical government.

# Small Council

**Bran (King)**

In the face of the undead apocalypse, Bran does jack squat to help and spends all his time silently watching the living get massacred. He mostly sits around staring at people or vegging out on the Weirwood trees. In a feast full of lords and warriors, he makes small talk about wheelchairs instead of relating firsthand accounts of landmark sociopolitical events and battles thousands of years ago. He has intensely negative charisma, telling his sister how beautiful she looked the night she was raped. Bran is definitely not going to inspire anybody to follow him with the storytelling choices he makes.

**Tyrion (Hand)**

The Westerlands hate Tyrion for murdering Tywin. The North (Sansa) doesn't trust Tyrion for his ""divided loyalties"". Dorne probably isn't a big fan since Oberyn died defending him. Tyrion's brother was the last threat menacing the Riverlands. His sister deposed the King from the Stormlands. He foisted Bronn as nominal ruler of Highgarden. The Iron Islands' perspective is entirely unclear.

In short, Tyrion isn't bringing any major house support to the table.

**Bronn (Master of Coin)**

Doesn't know how loans work. Foisted upon Highgarden by Tyrion despite absolutely zero connection with them. Highgarden was previously ransacked of everything of value by the Lannisters, who probably killed most of the key people as well. Bronn might be the only person left in the castle, and presumably doesn't actually have anybody personally loyal to him in Highgarden.

Bronn is probably just around because there aren't any battles for him to profit off of, and Tyrion needs a friend.

**Davos (Master of Ships)**

Davos' house is practically just his wife and kids. He backed Stannis, who murdered his daughter. Then he backed Jon Snow, who was a part of the King's Landing massacre before murdering their Queen. Davos was never that influential, and apart from people in the Stormlands who decided not to support or who abandoned Stannis, probably doesn't know many people of influence.

Davos is probably mostly there for the exposure and resume-building.

**Sam (""Grand"" ""Maester"")**

Double quotation marks for emphasis. Not only is Sam not even a Maester, he's definitely not a Grand Maester. He stole priceless books, quite possibly unique and irreplaceable ones, from the Citadel. The Maesters have such an ivory tower complex going on, it's likely he wouldn't even be allowed back in the Citadel, let alone brought into their inner circle. Hopefully Sam looks back fondly on his Night's Watch days, because sending ravens is probably going to be his only job again.

He's probably there mostly as an excuse to look at whatever cool toys from Qyburn survived Daenerys' rampage, especially since he's not allowed in the Citadel library and read all the books he stole.

**Brienne (Head of the Kingsguard)**

Brienne was always sort of an outcaste due to her ""unladylike"" aspirations. While she might be able to muster some support from her own House Tarth, she has always focused on being a knight rather than amassing influence.

She's probably mostly there because Sansa asked her to take care of Bran, and it's nominally fulfilling what she always wanted.

**Pod (Kingsguard)**

Pod was, up until recently, a squire. His main claim to fame is his prowess in the bedroom, which is somewhat negated by the Kingsguard's [purported chastity](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/The_Kingsguard).

He's probably mostly there out of loyalty to Brienne.

# So what is this government?

It's a pretense.

First, it gets Bran out of Winterfell. That leaves Sansa as the rightful heir. Bran's kicked upwards, but he hasn't got any jurisdiction over the North.

Second, it sets up a completely ineffectual government in what is now the middle of nowhere. Everybody in King's Landing is dead, the city has been destroyed by out-of-control dragonfire and wildfire. The only person with the background to be there is Tyrion, and he doesn't even want to be there and makes only a token effort to actually do his job. He spends about as much time rearranging chairs as they do discussing business. Overall, all they really accomplish is deciding to fix the loo, a book report by Sam, a token appearance by Bran, and arguing a bit about whether to build brothels in a city which looks like a reenactment of post-Vesuvius Pompeii. No one is entirely serious. After a grand total of four minutes, Tyrion is done for the day and starts telling brothel stories.

Third, it prevents the appearance of radical change while actually delegating all power to the individual Kingdoms. Sansa's implicit promise, in exchange for seceding with the North, is that everybody else is getting that too. Sure, Sam can send ravens to tell them their taxes are due, but whose army is he going to send when they don't pay? What small city's worth of financial, political, and legal specialists is Tyrion going to task with the day-to-day minutiae of running a continent-wide government?

Basically, Brienne and Pod are there to take care of Bran while Tyrion, Bronn, Davos, and Sam talk, shoot the breeze, get over their PTSD, and basically do anything *but* ruling. Bran gets peace and quiet to warg all day. After a few weeks, they'll probably all get bored of being the only seven people in a ten square mile radius and decide to ""relocate the capital"" to someplace more fun, like Bronn's house. Pretty soon, ""small council meeting"" will just be code for hanging out.",asoiaf

"/u/elio_garcia and Linda made two videos discussing the endgame of Game of Thrones and how they relate to the books. After the first one was released, HBO gave that interview with Isaac where he claimed that King Bran comes from GRRM. That is why they did a second video to further discuss the question of Bran specifically.

In the [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv92rBaiVbI), there are time stamps where you can watch their views on the endgame of particular characters. Regarding King Bran, they see serious problems with it, at least in the way it was played out in the show:

1. The secession of the North while the rest of Westeros bows to King Bran does not make any sense at all.

1. In the books, Bran will be a lot younger than the one in the show.

1. In the books, Bran is someone isolated from the rest of the story since ACoK and it is still a mystery how he will be reintroduced to the main action and get involved with the rest of the big cast.

1. In the books, a kingsmoot like council for electing the monarch requires not just the council of surviving characters. There number of voting lords should be much higher.

1. Elio is still skeptical of Bran ever leaving the cave in the books (though I disagree here because GRRM is clearly setting up Gorne’s Way, which is the only way Bran can return south). According to him, Bran will be the last greenseer on a weirwood throne, interacting with people through dreams and such and that is the kind of king he might be.

Then they discuss why D&amp;D might have changed GRRM’s ending (assuming they did) to write King Bran into the show. According to them, there might be several reasons for this:

1. D&amp;D did not like GRRM’s endgame king.

1. GRRM’s endgame king does not exist in the books yet (like a child that will be born later)

1. GRRM’s endgame king is a person they discounted and/or killed in the show.

Then they discuss how hard it is for GRRM to pass time in the books and whether there needs to be a time jump somewhere but then they decide that age is not the only problem for King Bran or another child king. The basic problem is that no one would back Bran unless he does something incredible like saving the world and everyone knowing and appreciating it. They ridicule the notion of Bran’s election because “he has the best story”. Unless GRRM starts talking about a new time jump like taking place after TWoW, they don’t see him going for King Bran. Elio is favorable with the idea of Bran becoming a greenseer king on a weirwood throne, king of the children of the forest, king beyond the Wall etc. but they don’t see Bran being the king of men.

Elio argues that the only foreshadowing for Bran is the weirwood throne and his story does not have anything to do with the Iron Throne. Linda points that even if they kill an awful lot of people in the future, a pure Stark being a claimant to the Iron Throne does not work in the books; nor do they find the idea of elective monarchy likely in the books. They don't believe GRRM is retreading Dune with the god-king Bran. They don't think King Bran was properly set up in the show.

"Pycelle's death by headache has mostly been an afterthought to me in comparison to the death of Kevan and other events. But it just occurred to me that the remaining Lannisters have lost their biggest supporter in KL and (imo, some may disagree) a pretty valuable asset.

Marwyn has basically confirmed that the ""Grey sheep"" have their own agenda, so I doubt this guy will simply serve as a raven caretaker and healer.

"  For the last several months or so I have taken my passion and obsession for ASOIAF and turned it towards the American Civil War. My interest in the Civil War era first began back in High School when I took an AP US History class with a wonderful teacher but it was entirely renewed again after I noticed a single connection between Jon Snow and Abraham Lincoln within George's writing. I have been pouring through audio books on the Civil War for awhile now. I have made several posts about Lincoln and ASOIAF in the past as I noticed them and I greatly appreciated the responses I received so I decided that I wanted to make a new post to summarize some of those previous thoughts and share a few new ones. In my opinion, George is so good at pulling inspiration from different places for singular characters that it can be hard to say for sure where his ideas come from. It's become very clear to me now that he likes to pull from fiction and non-fiction sources alike. A couple weeks ago I went back with some of my expanded knowledge on the Civil War and reread George's book about vampires, Fevre Dream. I was absolutely blown away my second time through this story by all of the details that went over my head the first time through. I am now convinced that it is a masterpiece of a story and I was fairly jubilant when I realized Fevre Dream takes place right before and right after the Civil War. Fevre Dream has now persuaded me that not only does George have extensive knowledge on this time period in American history but it has also convinced me that ASOIAF is not even the first time George has incorporated characteristics of Abraham Lincoln into one of his protagonists.

(I don't want to spoil Fevre Dream for anyone who has yet to read it but I would be happy to elaborate on the story if anyone is interested. For now I will stick to ASOIAF.)

There are a whole bunch of little details I've been curious about between the Civil War and ASOIAF but by far and away the strongest comparisons I have found in George's writing relate to Abraham Lincoln, the legendary President, and Jon Snow, the rightful ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Let me try to explain why Jon and Abraham have a lot in common:

To begin with, they are both described as melancholic or with similar words (which is a nice way of saying bittersweet). They also both seem to have paradoxical qualities to their appearance. Jon is described with the brooding long face of the Starks and he is compared to Ned specifically (Ned isn't considered attractive). Later on, Jon's face is referred to as being sweet by Ygritte . Lincoln himself was described as being so ugly he was beautiful and it was stated that his face had an element of tenderness. Jon was born in Southern Westeros and he was raised in the North. In America, Lincoln was born in the South and raised in the North. Both Jon and Lincoln experienced prophetic dreams throughout their lives and they both spent time visiting family at the crypts. They both had to grow up without their mother, who despite her absence was still able to play a major and mysterious role in their identity. At a young age Lincoln joined the Illinois militia to take part in the Black Hawk War. Having no military experience, Lincoln was immediately elected captain after proving his physical strength and his qualities of leadership to his men. Lincoln was mustered in and out twice during the short war and he ended his service working in an independent spy company. I think this brief time in Lincoln's life is mirrored well by Jon's quick rise in the Night's Watch and the turn of events that led to his espionage among the Freefolk. While Jon was drawn to leave home and serve the realm at the Wall, Lincoln was drawn to leave home and serve the public by practicing law. Lincoln and Jon Snow both experienced the death of their first love which made a major impact on who they became. Lincoln and Jon were both nominated to positions of leadership in spectacular fashion as dark horse candidates. Both Jon's choosing as Lord Commander and Lincoln's Republican nomination for president in 1860 Chicago involved some back-room dealing. During his Presidency, Lincoln evolved his opinions on slavery as the war progressed. Meanwhile, Jon evolved his opinions on the Freefolk as the threat of the Others was revealed to him (I like to think the Others present a supernatural threat of slavery). While Lincoln used the American Declaration of Independence to defend his beliefs of the equality of the slaves as citizens, Jon utilized the Night's Watch vows in similar fashion to back his decisions. He concluded that the Freefolk were equally a part of the realm of men as defined in the vows of the Night's Watch. Lincoln made the slaves free under the law and Jon saved the Freefolk by bringing them to other side of the Wall. After the Civil war ended, Lincoln gave only one speech on reconstruction before he was assassinated in a conspiracy. Jon gave only one speech on restoring House Stark before he was assassinated in a conspiracy. Lastly, this is more speculative, but I think their is a symbolic connection between Jon Snow and Abraham Lincoln as corn kings. I think Jon's role as a corn king is still being revealed in ASOIAF but Lincoln's life had come to an end in 1865. When Lincoln was first nominated for President, Southerners burned wicker effigies of him to protest his election. Shortly after the war ended, Lincoln was shot in the back of the head at point blank range around 10pm. Somehow, he managed to stay alive throughout the entire long night with his injury until the dawn of April 14th when he passed away. His death was very close to the end of the Winter and the beginning of Spring. At one point Lincoln even referred to the Civil War itself as ""the long winter"" and he perished only after seeing it through to the end. His body was carried by train on a long funeral procession through the blooming Spring fields and forests of the country. Season 8 Epsiode 1, where Jon learns his true identity for the first time actually aired on April 14th, the anniversary of Lincoln's assassination. I thought this fact was really interesting but maybe it doesn't mean anything.

Moving forward now, I wanted to point out a few more Lincoln-like qualities or events that I have noticed around other important characters:

**Daenerys** \- Dany's role as mother (Mhysa Mhysa) to the liberated slaves of Meereen reminds me a lot of ""Father Abraham"" and his journey among the freed slaves in the conquered city of Richmond.

**Ned Stark** \- one of the earliest casualties of the Civil War was Lincoln's close and personal friend Edward Baker who he affectionately called Ned. This death hit Lincoln very hard and he nearly collapsed in the street. Lincoln had many responsibilities as President but one of his jobs was to oversee the execution of all kinds of war criminals and traitors. He handled this role of overseeing executions with a grave and somber attitude. He prevented hundreds of deaths whenever it was within in his power to stop them. I think this theme of justice and executions is critical to Jon Snow's story as well.

**Mance Rayder** \- when Jon Snow first meets Mance Rayder, the King Beyond the Wall, he has just finishing uniting all of the Freefolk for the first time in Planetos history. Jon precedes to listen to Mance perform a song from the Southernmost kingdom of Westeros, which is Dorne. Immediately following the end of the Civil War when news reached Washington of Lee's surrender, instead of giving a speech Lincoln directed a band to play the Southern anthem ""Dixie"". He had his mind set on the reunification of the nation and he wanted to remind everyone of the bonds that tied them together. Dixie was well liked North and South before the Confederacy adopted it to their cause.

**Tyrion and Samwell** \- Tyrion's quote about his mind being a weapon almost sounds identical to something Lincoln would have said. Tyrion and Sam's dedication to reading and the general acquisition of knowledge reminds me a lot of Lincoln's personality.

And now just for fun I wanted to share a few small details I've been thinking about pertaining to the Civil War era:

* Jon's Snow's usurpation of Mance Rayder's leadership reminds me a lot of William H. Seward relationship with Abraham. Lincoln defeated Seward in the Republican nomination in spectacular fashion as I mentioned above but Lincoln went right ahead and made his rival Secretary of State. Seward had ultimately lost the election to Lincoln because he was too pro-abolition for the country as a whole but he sucked up his defeat and worked incredibly hard under Lincoln's leadership. They became very close friends.
* Mance Rayder = Emancipator in my opinion. William Seward did more than anyone else to unite the Republican party while Mance did more than anyone else to unite the Freefolk.
* I think Castle Black is a great opposite to the White House
* Another member of Lincoln's cabinet was Edward Bates. Bates tells a strange and interesting story in his journal about a frog that jumped onto his wife's pregnant belly. Their son was then apparently born with a frog-shaped birthmark. This is totally random but it really made me think about Bloodraven and his peculiar birthmark.
* Dolorous Edd reminds me a lot of Lincoln's well-liked Secretary of War Edwin Stanton who was very good at his job but had an incredibly gloomy personality due to a number of tragedies in his family
* Stannis Baratheon reminds me of a combination of two people from the era. First being Jefferson Davis who led the Confederacy with gritted teeth and grim determination against near impossible odds. The second person is John Brown who became known as the ""Meteor of the War"". John Brown believed he was chosen by God to lead the slaves to freedom and his decision to attempt and armed insurrection led to the death of innocent people as well as his children and himself. His actions incited the passions of the divided nation.
* Renly, strangely enough, reminds me of Stonewall Jackson. Stonewall Jackson loved the glory of battle but he was also a gardener. He was known to eat peaches from his own garden while riding his horse around the battlefield. Jackson was accidentally killed by his own men while Renly was killed by his own brother.
* Tywin Lannister's relationship with his father and his lifelong dedication to being a different kind of man is very similar to the relationship of Rober E. Lee and his father. Lee's father was disgraced due to gambling debts and I believe alcoholism but, nonetheless, Lee made a commitment to be the opposite of his father in a very similar fashion to the disturbed head of the lions.

On a final note, I just wanted to end by saying that I am always impressed with George's ability to name his characters. I think even this characteristic in itself ties well to Lincoln as he was so aptly named. It was quoted many times by many different people that Abraham was like a father to the soldiers and citizens of the Union. The meaning and origin of the name Abraham translates to ""Father of Many"". I have always wondered specifically what it was about Jon Snow that I liked so much after my discovery of the series and I think I have found my answer within parallels to the famous President. As I have read more and more about Lincoln and the Civil War I have found that my passion for Jon Snow has easily multiplied and transmuted into compassion and even reverence for the true living legend that was Honest Abe.

"tl;dr Dany going mad has so many unfortunate implications &amp; there may be a different ending for her + D&amp;D ain't shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I joined reddit just to write this post, though I’ve been checking certain subreddits from time to time.

I wanted to write this because I find it surprising how much people expect, or even root, for Daenerys to go mad.

She is my favourite character so of course I’m biased here, but I think that an ending like this would send a lot of unpleasant messages, my sympathies towards her aside.

&amp;#x200B;

If George decides that Dany should go mad, I will accept it. It’s his story, he’s allowed to do whatever he wants with it. However, I will be extremely disappointed if this is what he’s heading for.

Because let’s think for a second. Let's check how she started the story and how she could end it.

&amp;#x200B;

The first time we see Dany, she is a frightened child under her cruel brother’s thumb. In Dany’s very first chapter, we learn that Viserys sexually, emotionally and physically abuses her.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;His fingers brushed lightly over her budding breasts and tightened on a nipple. “You will not fail me tonight. If you do, it will go hard for you.    
&gt;  
&gt;You don’t want to wake the dragon, do you?” His fingers twisted her, the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her tunic. “Do you?” he repeated.

&amp;#x200B;

He marries her off to a foreigner twice her age (I think it’s good to remember that Dany is THIRTEEN. Even Viserys wonders if it’s not too early) and tells her that he wouldn’t mind her being raped forty thousand times if it means he gets an army. In ADWD we even learn that he wished to rape her before he gave her to Drogo.

Dany is then raped by her husband (yes, in the books as well):

&gt;Yet every night, some time before the dawn, Drogo would come to her tent and wake her in the dark, to ride her as relentlessly as he rode his stallion. He always took her from behind, Dothraki fashion, for which Dany was grateful; that way her lord husband could not see the tears that wet her face, and she could use her pillow to muffle **her cries of pain.**

Dany eventually adapts to the Dothraki ways, gets indenpendent from Viserys and no longer fears him.

We are getting to the moment that people love to call the „foreshadowing” for Dany’s mad queens turn. I mean the scene where she didn’t stop Drogo from killing Viserys. The showrunners said that this was a „chilling” reaction” from her. Let’s look at what Viserys did just before he got himself killed.

&gt;He laid the point of his sword between Daenerys’s breasts and slid it downward, over the curve of her belly. “I want what I came for,” he told her. “I want the crown he promised me. He bought you, but he never paid for you. Tell him I want what I bargained for, or I’m taking you back. You and the eggs both. He can keep his bloody foal. I’ll cut the bastard out and leave it for him.” The sword point pushed through her silks and pricked at her navel. Viserys was weeping, she saw; weeping and laughing, both at the same time, this man who had once been her brother.

Not only he’s been sexually, emotionally and physically abusing her for years. Now he literally **THREATENED THAT HE WILL CUT HER BELLY OPEN AND MURDER HER CHILD.**

Put yourself in Dany’s shoes for a second and think if you’d plead to the child’s father to spare him. I wouldn’t.

&amp;#x200B;

This gets me to the second ""foreshadowing"" of the ""madness"": Dany supposedly shrugging Viserys off and never thinking about him again. Wrong.

&gt;You have not laughed since your brother the Khal Rhaggat was crowned by Drogo,” said Irri. “It is good to see, Khaleesi.”Dany smiled shyly. It was sweet to laugh. She felt half a girl again.

&amp;#x200B;

Dany stopped laughing after Viserys was killed. 

If this isn’t sufficient for you to believe that she was AT LEAST conflicted about his death, this should:

&gt;„The cream-and-gold I call Viserion. Viserys was cruel and weak and frightened, yet he was my brother still. His dragon will do what he could not.""

She calls her dragon after Viserys. She honors her brother by naming her „child” after him. 

She thinks about him again in ASOS.

&gt;Viserys had been stupid andvicious, she had come to realize, yet sometimes she missed him all the same. Not the cruel weak man hehad become by the end, but the brother who had sometimes let her creep into his bed, the boy who toldher tales of the Seven Kingdoms, and talked of how much better their lives would be once he claimed his crown.

This gives us some insight into Viserys’ character as well. I think he did care about Dany, at least at the beginning, but the hardships he endured caused him to lash out on Dany and hurt her. Dany’s relationship with Viserys lines perfectly with what it’s like to be in an abusive relationship. It’s hard to let them go. Sometimes you wish you could have them back. They aren’t always monsters, sometimes they treat you kindly, other times they say they wouldn’t mind if you were raped forty thousand times.

You may wonder why it took me so long to describe Viserys' abuse, what it means for Dany, why it's so important in her story. All of this leads me to my final point:

Imagine if Viserys never died. Imagine if Dany has never gotten her dragons. In this case, she would never conquer Yunkai, Astapor and Meereen, she would never free slaves. And (if this is what George intends), would never go mad.

But if she does go mad, do you know what this implies?

**That it was better for her to be abused by her brother. It was better for her to be raped by her husband. It was better for her to be a meek, scared little girl. It was better for her to be abused than to get power. And if you don't mourn your abuser's death, you're just as bad as them, and you will inevitably go mad because of it.**

Dany being Aerys’ daughter, and turning into the mad queen, gives us another unpleasant message. **That is, children always eventually become their parents. If your parents are cruel, crazy, pyromaniac abusers, you will become one too.** And let me say this, as a person who was abused by my parents, this is my worst fear. That I will turn out to be them.

Another message is that you should not root for a character who tries to change the world they live in, because untimately, they are wrong, and they should be punished.

Oh, and mental illness will always make you a cruel tyrant.

This has gotten quite long, so I will not discuss her other signs of „madness”, since I have an entirely different point to make. I want you all to consider a possibility that there might be an other ending for Daenerys, that does not involve her becoming a mad queen, though from an outsider’s point of view, it may seem like it.

And I mean the casks of wildfire underneath the King’s Landing.

Aerys placed them there and only a handful of people know about them. So now let’s imagine that you’re Dany. After her last ADWD chapter, she is ready to take a much darker turn. I fully believe that Dany will fly to King’s Landing, ready to burn the Red Keep with Cersei/FAegon inside, not willing to harm innocents… and then all these casks of wildfire will explode.

Dany will have no idea about those, obviously, but she will still be responsible for it. It will be a pure accident, but it will be something that will change her as a character. It will be what leads her to the war with the Others, because she will want to redeem herself after this horrific accident.

And, to others, she may seem like a mad queen for what she did.

&amp;#x200B;

Many of you believe that Dany went mad in the show because George told D&amp;D about it. But then I need you all to remember that these are the same men who wrote the whole wight hunt from season 7 **because they wanted an ice bear**. And who said (I don’t remember what this was about) the famous quote: „creatively it made sense because we wanted it to happen”.

So if they wanted to make a final \~shocking twist\~, they didn’t need George’s direction for it. They just went for it, to SuBvErT eXpEcTaTiOns.

I hope that I managed to convince at least a handful of people. I must say, I just don’t want her to go mad. That’s all. Maybe I’m just reaching and in denial, but I just can’t stand this idea.",asoiaf
"I’m re-reading aGoT, and in the chapter where Jaime and Cersei are in the broken tower, Bran hear them arguing about Jon Arryn. Cersei seem convinced he knew about twincest and the paternity of her children. But how? We know she didn’t kill him or was part of that plot. We do know plans were made for Robyn to be fostered at Casterly Rock, apparently to ensure Lysa and Jon’s silence on the matter, as Cersei says in the text. Lysa may have been vocal about the Lannister’s murdering her husband, but there are no indication that she knows about the paternity of Cersei’s children. Who informed Cersei about Jon Arryn’s suspicions? We know Cersei has no real network of spies from her later chapters. Someone fed her information. I’m excluding Littlefinger as he took matters into his own hands, there was no need for him to inform Cersei. Varys seems like the likeliest candidate, but is there any textual evidence of this?",asoiaf
"The riverlands.  

At some point in clash of kings he should have traded Jaime for Sansa and allowed the rivers to be back in the peace of king Joffrey and allow the north to be a sovereign kingdom.  I think would have been an even trade.  What do you think.

"&gt;But in general, take my advice, when you meet anything that's going to be human and isn't yet, or used to be human once and isn't now, or ought to be human and isn't, you keep your eyes on it and feel for your hatchet. (C. S. Lewis) 

From the show, especially Season 8, and the books I list some 

* Observe that…
* But why?
* It doesn’t make any sense!

Then I offer *one* word that answers all of them. If not exactly ‘answers’, at least helps better understand or see an exciting development where previously there was only gloom, despair, or improbable stupidity. Even if you disagree with my interpretation, I hope you would find it impressive that so much can be explained by *one* name. 

## Faceless Men

Faceless Men – who is their prime target? 

Faceless Men game ‘tell me a lie’ – why is it a part of their training? Why is it so thorough? Whom are they ultimately trying to fool? A statement made by the true master of their game should be undistinguishable from truth even for somebody who could go *inside* the mind of a Faceless Man.

Why is it so important to become No One? 

1. Article 1 of Faceless Men constitution: **Every man has a right to die.** How would they feel about somebody who doesn’t show any inclination of dying anytime soon?
2. Article 2 of Faceless Men constitution: **Every man has a right to live in freedom.** How would they feel about an *enslaver*? 

&gt;I am Arya Stark and I am going home to Winterfell.

Except, she didn’t go home to Winterfell. The Faceless Man was smiling – he was happy because Arya made a statement undistinguishable from the truth. Whether because Arya was silently adding *‘just not right away’*, Jesuit style, or some other technique, it doesn’t matter. She has completed her training. 

&gt;I am going West of Westeros

The announced plans hardly ever materialize on the show or in the books. And now suddenly Arya remembers a throw-back line from Season 6? 

Whom is she misleading? Somebody who would know that she *did* say that once? But she didn’t tell about it to anybody. So, how would anybody know? Unless that somebody knows everything regardless. 

Is it the *ultimate lie* she has been training for? The sentences start similar, ""I am going..."" 

## Howland Reed or who else was at Tower of Joy

&gt;Ned’s wraiths moved up beside him, with shadow swords in hand. They were seven against three.

It wasn’t just seven and three, though, was there? There was an observer. Who looked pretty much like a shadow. An observer who wouldn’t even exist unless Reed kills Ser Arthur Dayle.

So, *who killed Arthur Dayle*?

Eddard Stark is an embodiment of honor and chivalry. It is reasonable to expect the same from his friends and companions whom he chose to accompany him to the Tower of Joy. Howland Reed wouldn’t kill Ser Arthur Dayle by stabbing in the back, even if Eddard’s life was in danger, would he? 

## Who kills who?

Tywin Lannister shares responsibility for the killings at Red Wedding even if he didn’t kill a single person there. Whose hand makes the final blow is important, but the book makes it very clear that others are not to be resolved from their guilt. Stannis doesn’t physically kill Renly, yet he is accused of the killing and accepts the verdict. 

*Who kills the Night’s King*? It is Arya’s hand that moves, but whose brain gave the order to move the hand? 

Would you feel better if it wasn’t Jon Snow who *really* killed Daenerys?

Throughout the book we observe a very strong symmetry between Fire and Ice. And yet in killings of their champions, Daenerys and the Night King, the symmetry apparently breaks. Arya kills the Night King? And Jon kills Daenerys? 

Why Fire and Ice *activate* so drastically *at the same time* at the beginning of the books?

What or who are they afraid of? 

Symbols in the cave – they have to mean something, right? Symbols in the snow – they should also mean something, what do you think? In S1, Ep1, we see a circle crossed by a line. In the same scene, we see a head pierced by a spear. Is circle a head, a brain, a mind? Head is somehow important, because a White Walker throws it to the Night Watchman and sends him with a warning.

Somebody who could go into a human’s head would be called a *telepath.* Preston Jacobs is not always wrong.

The very first Point-of-View chapter – check the name on it.

&gt;Yet our way is the older way. The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.

We don’t see too many characters following this advice, do we? What is the importance of that, then? Is it that somebody who should be following this principle - does not? Is somebody murdering by other people’s hands? 

Why people in Winterfell are not excited about Daenerys? Dragons rarely come North and the few times they did are well documented and remembered. In the beginning, Bran is excitedly waiting for the king’s train to arrive, and all we got was essentially a fat old dude on a horse. Now we have a beautiful queen with a famous name arriving on two dragons with Dothraki and Unsullied from exciting exotic places – and nobody in Winterfell seem to really care. People loved Daenerys in Essos. People were amazed by Targaryens and Dragons in Westeros before. Why not now, not in Winterfell? 

Is there something wrong with people of Winterfell?

Well, is there something wrong with people of Westeros? Daenerys seemed to think so. 

## Characters acting out-of-character

After Winterfell, our characters seem a bit off. 

* Varys is talking with Tyrion in a big room, essentially in the open. He is trying to convince Jon Snow literally in the open, with anybody to see. He is writing and sending letters that are unlikely to have the effect he desires, but very likely to have the effect he dreads.
* Tyrion actions seem illogical.
* After several nights at Winterfell, Jaime suddenly realizes that he loves Cersei and has to be back at KL. All tangible outcome his action achieves is to be captured, released by Tyrion, and thus contributing to Daenerys’ feeling of betrayal. 

Rhaegal is hit by three consecutive shots. Yet all attempts in the next episode against a bigger dragon fail to find the mark. Was somebody improving Euron’s abilities to kill Rhaegal? 

Was somebody mentally interfering with Scorpion shooters’ attempts to kill Drogon? 

Tyrion speeches are mentioned several times. On several occasions Tyrion is trying to persuade:

* Slavemasters to end the war
* His own sister to join the war
* Twice
* Qyburn
* Cersei again, not to execute the hostage, killing whom is not in Cersei’s interests anyway, because it doesn’t help her situation.

Tyrion *fails* on all those occasions. The *only time* his speech *works* is when he is trying to convince Jon Snow to kill Daenerys. Did somebody help Tyrion to write that speech?

## Characters act as if they are losing their memory

&gt;It’s not that what happened two minutes ago matters anymore. (From some Season 7 episode review by Preston Jacobs)

Unsullied really want to kill and destroy KL. Yet in the next episode they are happily strolling through the city, quite content.

The same applies to Dothraki.

Asha/Yara apparently forgot the pact with Daenerys and that her own goal was Iron Islands independence. For generations it was, the key motivation for her father’s actions. 

Tyrion explains to Jon Snow that he loves Daenerys, too. Yet twenty minutes later he doesn’t seem particularly grief stricken. 

It is as if somebody *erased* Daenerys from people’s memory entirely. 

Hmm, who have access to people minds and memories? Who, in fact, claims that he *is* the memory? 

If your memory is somewhere else or is *somebody else* it is no longer *your* memory, is it? If you upload a file to Dropbox and then erase it, what happens if Dropbox decides that you are better off if the file is to be, well, gone and forgotten? 

## Why everybody is so happy, crazy, or happily crazy? 

Tyrion wins that round by insisting to share his joke with the new Small Council. And appointing Bronn the Master of Coin. 

\&gt; And with proper advisers, she never will be \[her father\].

Yet Varys deserts his advising duties, and so does Tyrion – is it any wonder that things go wrong with Daenerys? When the two people who last season insisted that she needs the right advisers decide to no longer advise her? 

How does Tyrion react to all his failures and betrayals? Oh, he is telling jokes and thinking about brothels. 

I thought there was something between Tyrion and Sansa – I swear Episode 3 created that impression. Never mind, apparently she wants to be in the North and Tyrion is quite happy back to King’s Landing. 

Everybody is happy and crazy at the same time – except surviving Starks.

* Jon looks puzzled and perplexed at what happened. He honestly doesn’t understand what just happened and why he did what he did. Debatable. But one thing certain – he doesn’t look happy.
* Arya is actually crying for Jon. Arya. Crying. Is it because she understands what just happened and *who* did it?
* Sansa acts quite rationally. I suspect she understands who is pulling the strings, but doesn’t care. She is not willing to do anything about it.

Arya might. She is not going west of Westeros, is she? She needs somebody to think she does. 

So, why Starks are not affected by overall madness? Is it because their telepathic abilities effectively protect them from a telepathic meddling, especially if the meddler is somehow related to them?

## And other things

Why suddenly Alys Rivers’ story looks so important now? See my lo-o-ong write up at [https://fractal-affinity.com/got/c19/Alys%20Rivers.html](https://fractal-affinity.com/got/c19/Alys%20Rivers.html) Why didn’t Martin finish her story in Fire &amp; Blood, Part 1? What was Jaqen H’ghar’s assignment? Why he spends so much time around Harrenhal? Is it because of somebody like Alys Rivers but much more powerful? 

Why most powerful *entity* on Westeros is apparently doing nothing?   
Is it actually doing *everything*? 

Who says he is not what people call him? 

Who has died, yet not many noticed, and we refused to accept it and still are? 

Why does it matter where Drogon is flying? 

Why leave unanswered questions in the last episode of the last season of the show? 

Unless it is not the last episode? Or not the last season? Or, perhaps, HBO was honest with us and it *is* the *last* episode of the *last* season of the *show* – but they wanted to do a Game of Thrones *movie,* for a while, didn’t they? 

Who is the final boss of Game of Thrones, the movie? 

## The one name to rule them all

Somebody who hasn't been named in this post. Somebody who used to have a name.

&gt;But not really. Not anymore. 

One short word that explains so much: Bran.",asoiaf
"In *Story*, Robert McKee presents what he calls the Principle of Antagonism:

&gt;A protagonist and the story can only be as intellectually fascinating and emotionally compelling as the forces of antagonism make them.

This isn't about the protagonist having a compelling antagonist, but rather about the depth of antagonism against the protagonist's central values. If a character seeks wealth, then the story is as compelling as the forces pushing him away from that and towards poverty. If they seek love and family, then it's the forces driving them towards isolation.

At the core of the principle is that antagonism isn't binary. McKee describes four states a value can be in, the Positive, Contradictory, Contrary, and Negation of the Negation. To simplify the terms though, I'll call these the Positive, Negative, Middle, and Hell. Think of the hell scenario as the monkey's paw perversion of the central value; it has the superficial markings of victory, but is a fate worse than death.

If a character seeks romantic love, the positive outcome is going to be a typical rom-com romantic ending. The middle ground might be not ""getting the girl,"" but strengthening important friendships. The negative ending is isolation from the object of affection. Hell is a loveless, unfaithful marriage. In a detective story, the positive is bringing the bad guy to justice, the negative is the bad guy escaping, hell is a bigger bad using a fall guy and ending up with even greater power, and the middle ground is the True Detective Season 1 ""the dark has more territory, but the light is winning"" outcome.

For a story to be fully engaging, we need to see each of these states in play -- they won't all necessarily come to pass during the story, but the audience needs to be able to understand what each of these outcomes would be like. When we look at the central values in A Song of Ice and Fire, we can then break out the four states of that value and see how as an audience we're cognizant of what those would be like -- and should we ever underestimate Hell, we're given it in full force. For ASOIAF, three core values are Justice, Life, and Family.

**Justice**

While ASOIAF is short on dispensing justice, we're never really left doubting what justice would look like. Let's take the question of Robert's succession. In the positive outcome, Ned would have taken Joffrey and Cersei into custody, protected them, installed Stannis on the throne (with a guarantee to at least protect Cersei's children, though perhaps not her for her treason against Robert), and Renly serving as Hand and softening Stannis's reign.

The middle ground is Joffrey is king and Cersei holding sway, but their worst impulses checked by Tyrion, Tywin, Kevan, and the other non-psychopaths at court. The wrong person sits on the throne, but the realm is in truth ruled by a competent council.

The negative outcome is one where Joffrey is not only on the throne, but where his commands are obeyed and go unchecked. It's a reign where he no longer needs to say ""I am the king.""

Hell is Stannis winning against Joffrey at King's Landing, defeating the Lannister forces, and then turning his army to destroy Robb, naming him traitor and usurper.

**Life**

Jon Snow's been beating this drum since Craster's Keep: the real war in ASOIAF is between the living and the dead. Melisandre has the same message, and (show) Syrio tells us there is only one god, the god of death to whom we say ""Not today.""

Positive: The maximum number of people not only live, but have (to borrow from Band of Brothers) long and happy lives in peace.

Middle: The Battle for the Dawn is won, and the realm returns to peace, but with significant losses. The realm survives, broken, but ready to be rebuilt as the new spring comes. Call it ""bittersweet.""

Negative: The Battle for the Dawn is lost, and the realm turns into a land of perpetual living death.

Hell: The Battle for the Dawn is won, but Daenerys turns mad queen and reigns through fire and blood. All the victories paid for with the deaths of good and brave soldiers reap only more death. The wheel is stronger than ever.

**Family**

The Stark family being split when Ned goes South, Jon Snow finding a new brotherhood, Cersei's love for Jaime and her children, and even Daenerys with her dragons, the series has always had family at its core. Looking at the Starks specifically though during the War of the Five Kings, we can see all the different possibilities:

Positive: The Lannisters accept Robb's peace terms (after some more bargaining, of course), Sansa is returned home and with peace restored, Arya makes it back as well. Catelyn gets to watch Bran riding Dancer, and when she learns about Jon's role in getting the saddle made she stops being so horrible to him the few times he's able to visit.

Middle: Robb and Catelyn die at the Twins, but Arya, Sansa, Bran, Rickon and Jon live on and are reunited, though only briefly before moving on.

Negative: They all either die or are scattered to the wind, never seeing each other again, never knowing what happened to anyone else, and not even knowing who is alive or dead.

Hell: Some of the surviving Starks are reunited, only to then betray each other. Or, quite possibly, Arya learns that the Brotherhood Without Banners is lead by Catelyn under the name Lady Stoneheart. She finally gets reunited with her mother only to then learn she's an empty, vengeful shell of the woman who'd raised her (and Arya is prevented from ending LSH). (Show) Sansa's return to Winterfell is a hell outcome.

**It Can't Always Be Hell**

While the hell option is certainly one of the things that makes ASOIAF stand out as being particularly brutal, all hell all the time gets really monotonous. Even Doom needs to spend time on Mars and Earth. It's enjoyable to have your emotional muscles stretched by being given events beyond what you thought possible (hey, the Bolton Northmen are retaking Winterfell!), but too much and it becomes one-note.

While no one is really expecting a happy ending to the series, it's not out of the realm of possibility that *one* of the central values the series is concerned with will find its way to a positive outcome. Perhaps justice wins out the day, but at a high cost in life and personal sacrifice. Similar to the end of Lord of the Rings (and I ain't talking about Aragorn's tax policies):

&gt;I tried to save the Shire, and it has been saved, but not for me. It must often be so, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them.

The value of peace in LotR hits the positive state, but the value of friendship lands at a *bittersweet* middle, and the sense of wonder and exploration and magic is actually at a negative as the Elves leave Middle Earth, the Ents have no sign of the Entwives, and the Fourth Age is one of peace, but not of magic.

**So What Happened With The Show?**

I believe one of the weaknesses in the final season was that too many of the outcomes were a forgone conclusion to the point where our minds don't dwell on the other possibilities. The Night King will be defeated, either in episode 3 or 4, though we don't know exactly how or how great (or insignificant) the losses will be -- we expect a positive or middle outcome. Dany will defeat Cersei but be killed by Jon afterwards -- we expect Jon and Dany will both go through hell.

The issue is not just that we've seen the ending, but that the show (largely because of pacing, I suspect) doesn't invite us to truly contemplate a full range of outcomes. By comparison, the novels are rich with possibility, even when we know what's going to happen. These possibilities are baked into the text and the character's thoughts. Will Joffrey reign, and if so, will he be checked by Tyrion as acting Hand? What if the war ends and Sansa is ransomed, but Arya remains missing? Will Daenerys decide that Slaver's Bay is her true home and kingdom?

In A Clash of Kings, when Stannis commands Davos to smuggle Melisandre into Storm's End, they discuss the nature of the future, and the fact that Melisandre has seen multiple conflicting ends:

&gt;Stand before the nightfire and you'll see for yourself. The flames shift and dance, never still. The shadows grow tall and short, and every man casts a dozen. Some are fainter than others, that's all. Well, men cast their shadows across the future as well. One shadow or many. Melisandre sees them all.

The novels are so keenly engaging because we're asked to think about the many different futures that may come about. The show ended with a more fatalistic view, to borrow from Dead Poets Society, it was less ""every many casts a dozen shadows"" and more ""'Twas always thus, and always thus will be.""

"I just read the first 120 or so pages of the first book for the first time and I'm absolutely hooked.  I have already watched the show in its entirety and despite its disappointing ending I still love it and the story as a whole so this reading experience has been incredible.  I could go on and on about how much my enjoyment of the story is being enhanced by all of the little details and background information and character moments, but I have a few details in particular that stood out to me and really resonated that I wanted to share:

&amp;#x200B;

* When Tyrion and Jon speak on their way to the wall I found it noteworthy that Tyrion is reading a book about dragons, obviously, in my mind, this was a cool possible foreshadowing of Jons identity.  
* I was pretty surprised at just how brutal Catelyns hatred for Jon is in the books so far.  She seemed cold to him in the show, but she is genuinely cruel to him in the books.  Was not expecting that.
* Tyrion's description of the Field of Fire genuinely has me hoping they bring it to life on screen one day.  I have always heard people mention this battle when reading comments on the Spoils of War episode from the show, but reading about it in detail for the first time definitely has me interested in not just that battle, but Aegon and his sisters as a whole.

Again, there are so many small moments and details that enrich the story that I wasnt expecting.  Makes me wish we could get a well done animated series that could put as much of this story on screen as possible.  Thanks for entertaining my thoughts and I hope to check in if I find anything else interesting to share!",asoiaf
"I'm just wrapping up listening to the first book, within the last few hours and Maester Luwin is explaining the story of the Children of the Forest and the First Men to Bran. 

The Children of the Forest once populated most of present-day Westeros, until The First Men came and went to war with them to take it for themselves. The Children of the Forest would use leaves instead of armor to help camouflage them into the landscape. The Children had a more intimate connection with nature and trees and magic. Finally, the Children and First Men made a truce to co-exist, but over the centuries, the Children have mostly died out and whoever remains was pushed north. 

I was listening to an interview with GRRM where he was talking about how he often uses real world events to map onto his fantasy world. He spoke of how the Faith of the Seven was mostly inspired by with real-world Catholicism and how the faith of the old gods is mostly inspired by Paganism. It felt to me that there exists a similar mapping between the story of real-world Native Americans and the Children of the Forest.",asoiaf
"After the threats of Ice and Fire are dealt with, we'll undoubtedly get a much longer aftermath in the books than in the last episode of Game of Thrones, and I suspect we'll get a ""Scouring of the Shire"" segment with Littlefinger as the villain.

I believe Cersei is not long for this world and Aegon VI will be King by the time Dany invades, and Euron is fully tied to the ""Ice"" plot, potentially playing the role taken by the Night King in the TV series. Littlefinger however, as a completely human agent who has been causing mayhem since the very beginning and isn't tied to either of the Ice of Fire threads, will linger on to act as the bookend.

The TV writers gave Littlefinger an underwhelming end Barristan style to be rid of a character and an actor who needs paying, and it didn't land because it came early and in the midst of much bigger storylines. His death in the books will probably occur in a similar manner but carry more weight because the supernatural threats are already dealt with and it's symbolic of resolving events that were set in motion at the very beginning, providing a sense of symmetry.",asoiaf
Just wondering since I really want to see/hear about their history! I saw the Targ. Conquest on a YouTube video (narrated by Vyserys and more characters) and it was very entertaining.

"In A Clash of Kings, Daenerys has numerous visions within the House of the Undying. Among these are a few notable prophecies, such as the blue flower within the wall (R+L=J), the blue-eyed king with a red sword (likely Stannis), the mummer's dragon (the fAegon theory), and a vision of Rhaegar with Elia Martell. Each of these is quite easily ascribed to something that happens, has happened, or will happen within the story. Each of these is something that us fans have taken to and tried to describe their purpose within the story because all of them are seemingly something actually *in* the story. All but one.

&gt;Then phantoms shivered through the murk, images in indigo. Viserys screamed as the molten gold ran down his cheeks and filled his mouth. A tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair stood beneath the banner of a fiery stallion, a burning city behind him. Rubies flew like drops of blood from the chest of a dying prince, and he sank to his knees in the water and with his last breath murmured a woman's name. . . . mother of dragons, daughter of death . . . 

Here, we can see that all of these in the first set are easily ascribed, and have been, Viserys, Rhaego, and Rhaegar, the three closest Targaryens she has known up to this point. But there's something off. The death of Viserys, what could have been of Rhaego, and the death of Rhaegar. See something strange? Rhaego, of this first set, is the only one that hasn't happened. It's the only one that can't happen. In fact, throughout the entirety of this time of prophecies, the hypothetical reign of Rhaego as the Stallion-Who-Mounts-The-World is the one that cannot happen, metaphorically or literally, because Rhaego's dead. 

There's another thing, too. Rhaego's is the only one without that Targaryen's death. In both the visions of Viserys and Rhaegar, it features the death of that Targaryen. That renders this one vision the odd one out, despite the fact that it's nigh universally regarded as Rhaego and his possible reign as the Stallion-Who-Mounts-The-World. All the evidence points to it, the copper skin, the silver-gold hair, the fiery stallion. But, what if it's not?

##Who Else Can It Be? 

In order to find out who the prophecy of the Tall Lord is, we have to analyze the evidence within the vision and why that points to Rhaego. Let's analyze the quote again. 

&gt;A tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair stood beneath the banner of a fiery stallion, a burning city behind him.

So there are four categories that lead us to define this as Rhaego, the height, the copper skin, silver-gold hair, and the banner of the fiery stallion. At the time of ACOK, there really isn't anyone else who it can be, but as the books came out, another possible suitor appears. His name is **Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name**, or, should you believe a certain theory, simply **Young Griff**. Now, how can this be Aegon?

**A tall lord**: Let's look at the first time we meet Young Griff, in ADWD, Tyrion II.

&gt;Tyrion craned his head to one side, and saw a boy standing on
the roof of a low wooden building, waving a wide-brimmed straw hat. He was a lithe and
well-made youth, with a **lanky build** and a shock of dark blue hair. The dwarf put his age
at fifteen, sixteen, or near enough to make no matter.

Young Griff is described as lanky, tall for his age, if a bit thin. He could easily fit the description of the ""tall lord"", should he grow into his height during his invasion of the Stormlands. 

**with copper skin**: This is a bit tricky. Young Griff's skin color is never described in depth and he's described as having the features of a Targaryen, with silver hair and violet eyes, and all that. However, should Aegon be who he says he is, House Martell is consistently described as having olive skin, with some of those with both Targaryen and Martell blood (such as Baelor Breakspear and Aegon's sister Rhaella) being described as inheriting the traits of House Martell. Should Griff inherit his alleged mother's skin color or gain a tan in the wars to come, his skin could turn to the copper color described. Copper skin *is* consistently brought to describe Drogo and the stillborn Rhaego, but this description could just be Daenerys seeing what she wants to see.

**and silver-gold hair**: Easy, Young Griff has the silver-gold hair of House Targaryen. Interestingly, this ""silver-gold hair"" so often described is missing its common pairing of purple eyes. This could be attributed to Martin simply finding it flowed better to not mention it or because Aegon doesn't have the traditional eyes of House Targaryen, with blue eyes in daylight and purple by candlelight, compared to Daenerys, whose purple eyes are often mentioned, or Rhaegar, who has ""deep purple"" eyes, or even Egg, whose eyes are near-black by lamplight and just purple in daylight.

**stood beneath the banner of a fiery stallion**: Now, this one is the easiest to link to Rhaego. He's the birth of a Dothraki stallion and the dragon, and so, a fiery stallion. However, there's one other character that is linked to the fiery stallion. 

&gt;So here's Bittersteel: a winged red stallion on a golden field. Only the horse has big black dragon wings instead of the usual Pegasus-style feathered angel wings, and he's snorting fire.

&gt;So Spake Martin, Dec. 26, 2005

Bittersteel. The founder of the Golden Company, which now rides for Aegon in his quest to retake the Iron Throne. I say that the figure is not under the banner *depicting* a fiery stallion, but rather one that represents the fiery stallion, Bittersteel. With all descriptors potentially met, it's definitely possible that Aegon is the one Dany sees, not Rhaego.

Now, if Aegon really is the person depicted in the visions, that leaves one question. What is the burning city?

##What This Could Mean

&gt;a burning city behind him.

Every other one of these visions in this set is the death of a Targaryen, their murder at the hands of another. From what we've seen in the television show, it's very likely that Daenerys and her forces will end up besieging King's Landing. However, it's unlikely Cersei will still hold the throne, due to the missing factor: Aegon. [As others have theorized](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/bozxfa/spoilers_main_99_of_the_shows_problems_are_due_to/), I believe that Aegon will end up in control of the south and be King on the Iron Throne (potentially the last king ever, should events play out similarly to the show). So, this leaves Aegon on the throne in King's Landing, as Dany breaks the wheel before him.

The burning city is King's Landing and this vision, like the others, is the death of a Targaryen.",asoiaf
"I started rereading the books recently and this question had been on my mind. To my surprise after some googling I couldn't find a clear answer, which is rare considering how much the books are discussed. My bad if I just worded it wrong and therefore I couldn't find anything, in that case just point me the right way.

After Drogo becomes basically borderline comatose and Dany wakes up after her miscarriage, she finds out that the Khalasar is gone and the strongest Ko's of Drogo have declared themselves new Khals. 

Why did they leave her there?, by rights shouldn't she have been taken to Vaes Dothrak as a Khal's widow or killed for fucking up Drogo with bloodmagic? Or did they already know about Rhaego and let Dany there because they just didn't care? Just seems odd considering how much the Dothraki adhere to their rules and mores.",asoiaf

"I bought the leather bound 5-book boxset after binging the show multiple times, watching all of the Alt-Shift-X vids, listening to a bunch of podcasts, reading tons of insane fan theories, and seeing thousands of posts claiming that the books are supremely better than the TV show, which is a little unfathomable to me because Seasons 1-4 are up there with the best television ever.

ANYWAYYY...Idk, is there some website or something that I can read along with to make the experience better? I'm not the best at remembering character names and places and stuff like that and from the few sample chapters I read on Kindle, it seems like GRRM is super duper extremely complex in the way he writes and it makes me feel overwhelmed.

"Is Ice actually a generally useful sword? Its described as pretty massive even by greatsword standards at 4 feet long and like the width of a man's palm iirc. Obviously it can be used in all situations as you can hardly carry it on your hip but is it actually a useful sword to use in warfare?

I mean its absolutely massive so its pretty difficult to be graceful and to move your blade around a lot. But its supposedly not that heavy for swords as its valyrian steel especially as most Lord Starks who wield it have most likely trained in arms since birth. On the other hand, in the press of a melee its almost impossible to not get it caught on something unless your pretty tall.

Just some thoughts would be appreciated thanks.

Edit: A lot of the comments so far have revolved around how large Ice is. But the Swords of the Morning are supposed to have been great swordsmen with their own greatsword Dawn. So just to include that aswell. But Ice is supposed to be big for greatswords aswell.",asoiaf
"While I was rereading the hedge knight, I got very curious about Aerion “Brightflame” Targaryan. It seems that George had originally intended for him to be a larger presence in the main series, and possibly was intended for young griff to be his descendant (only to eventually be overshadowed by the blackfire plot).

 

His coat of arms struck me as particularly curious. A three-headed dragon: one head red, one head yellow, and one head orange. Where on earth did those colours come from? 

 

Well we know that Aerion, like his brothers, was plagued by dragon dreams. I think it is possible that Areion dreamed of the birth of Danny’s dragons specifically, with the colour of the dragon heads on his sigil matching up with the eye/horn colour of each of Danny’s dragons. The dragons are described as such in the books:

 

Drogon: Black scales, with red eyes and horns (the red head)

Viscerion: White scales with golden eyes and horns (the yellow head)

Rhaegal: Green scales with bronze eyes (the orange head)

 

Given the nature of dragon dreams, it is possible that in his dreams the dragons heads alone were these colours, symbolizing the different eye colours of Danny’s dragons.

 

As he has this coat of arms as early as “the hedge Knight”, it is likely that this has been a recurring dream throughout his life. This culminated in his death by drinking wildfire believing that it would turn him into a dragon. Aerion likely saw himself as the saviour of his family, and all of westeros, bringing the rebirth of dragons (which probably didnt help with his ego)",asoiaf

"If the show’s season 8 did one thing right - albeit unintentionally - it is to show how vital the Young Griff plotline is to ASOIAF, both thematically and from a worldbuilding/character perspective. 

Prior to season 8, I was one of the readers who was very skeptical about GRRM’s decision to introduce fAegon so late into the books. I found it concerning especially given that there are supposed to be two more books to wrap up the story and yet this entire new plotline is brought in quite late in the game. I was wrong to doubt GRRM. 

One of the strengths of the books that the show completely fails in from season 6 onwards is George’s ability to make the world of ASOIAF feel lived-in. That is, Westeros and beyond all feel like they existed long before the book’s story, and will continue to exist long after the books conclude. The world abides by internally consistent rules, and actions have consequences following those rules. However, the show’s exclusion of the Young Griff plotline has made me realize why I felt so disappointed with the later seasons: the world feels so shallow and superficial. 

Let’s take a show example: Cersei blowing up the Sept. Now, this would have been an ideal cornerstone of the Young Griff plot (not that I think it will happen in the books but I can easily imagine it working within the larger Aegon plot). George establishes the importance of the Faith to the smallfolk and lords alike both in the main books and in Fire and Blood. Cersei blowing up the Sept should have started riots in King’s Landing. Those riots would have spread like wildfyre (tap tap is the mic on) across Westeros. We’d be getting reports of smallfolk actively attacking Lannisters in the Westerlands as a symbol of this corrupt regime. Rumours will swirl about Qyburn and his unholy atrocities. Even lords would reject the crown much in the same way some did under Maegor the Cruel. A dozen new “high sparrows” or Septon Moons would emerge to lead these fanatic (and armed) mobs, decrying the abomination that sits on the Iron Throne. In essence, the world would feel alive and responsive to character decisions. Actions have ripple effects well beyond the immediate result - something we saw when Cersei armed the Faith in the first place. 

Enter Young Griff. Blackfyre or not, the boy has been trained to be a king, including a rigorous education in the Faith. A savior has arrived. He unites the angry smallfolk and lords against Cersei and marches on King’s Landing. Much like Jahaerys I succeeding Maegor, Aegon may even make a deal with the Faith and receive their blessing thus legitimizing him in the eyes of the smallfolk and lords. Cersei is rooted out of the Red Keep and the cloth dragon is parades to the cheers of the crowd. 

Thus, when Daenerys arrives at Westeros, she does not face a universally despised alcoholic monarch hanging by a thread. She faces a beloved and popular King. Now she is the invader who is set to ruin the peace. The tyrant who wants to overthrow the rightful and legitimate heir. And here her madness emerges. 

Without Young Griff however, the show fell flat on its face. The need to have a human enemy for Dany in addition to the supernatural one meant that without Aegon, Cersei had to be kept in the game well beyond her expiry date. Along with a myriad of other baffling decisions, the result is the show’s world feels like a prop set, a stage for a set number of characters to recite their lines. There is no universe to get lost in, just a few one liners that can be printed on t-shirts and sold as merch. Thoughts?

TLDR: I’m sorry for ever doubting you about the inclusion of Young Griff, George. It’s an absolutely vital part of the plot and I was wrong to despair.",asoiaf
"... that it was going to end in shit?

I think a lot of people say S5 Dorne when thing really took a turn to nonsense or how they dealt with Stannis's demise, which I totally agree are atrocious.

They're not going to address the fundamental problems that lead to the War of The Five Kings, and the only thing going for them is that Bran has a nation wide surveillance state. My question is how would you make meaningful changes instead? There would need to be something akin to the Magna Carta or Aegon V's reforms, and while making it so that the king is elected rather than inherited is a good start, there also need to be laws and individuals to reign in a rulers power. While I would give Bronn a minor lordship with some land and a castle, I don't think he is qualified for such as massive position as  Lord Paramount.

Additionally he was born all weak and small just how Petyr was a frail thing growing up.

"Okay, so I’m on this subreddit pretty often and it baffles me with how many posts and comments I see saying Jon is *the* main character of the series, it is his story to tell, and only his at that matter! 

While I do think some characters are particularly much more important than others, Jon Snow being one of them, him being the sole central part of the story goes against the many fundamentals that GRRM has stayed faithful to since the beginning of his career in writing fantasy. 

Let’s start listing the reasons. 

#**FANTASY TROPES**

Since day one, George has made it clear that he does not like the basic way of fantasy storytelling authors often use, writing off a hero to the story to save the day and leave it at that ultimately. This has been made clear since Ned Stark’s execution, the Red Wedding, oh so many events that come off the top of my head! 

Unfortunately the TV Series does come into play here. The majority of people have watched it. Considering how whitewashed the show has made him, it is not hard to believe why you may think he is destined to be the central character for this story. 

&gt; Jon Snow has always been the hero... he’s always been the savior. 

— [The show runners themselves ](https://youtu.be/ZJ1yC3yESLQ) 

Not only is it pretty terrible how the show runners of the show do not even understand the basic points of the series themselves, but it leads people to believe that this is George’s message — that this was his plan for his characters when it wasn’t. 

We don’t need to hear George say it over and over again, there are no pure heroes to his story. **Notice I said pure, because I believe there are heroes and there is heroism in the world but they do a fantastic job at overpraising him to be something he’s not.** GRRM believes everyone has even a little bit of *grey*, and in the books, every character ultimately lives up to this. Especially Jon. 

#**The meaning of A Song of Ice and Fire, Jon and Daenerys, and their importance to the story** 

This one is pretty self-explanatory I’d think. A lot of people are on the boat where they say to themselves: “*Oh my God!*, Jon is a Stark and a Targaryen! He is the song of Ice and Fire! It has been his story all along!” And partly, they are correct, but not for the latter statement. 

There are *many* layers to what A Song of Ice and Fire means. Let’s get into them. Firstly, we have to realize that this story is separated mainly into 3 structures: **The rise of Daenerys Targaryen in the East, the Game of Thrones and the fight between the Starks, Lannister’s, and other great houses in Westeros, and the rise of the icy threat beyond the wall** 

Of these components, two of them are outlying while one is pretty much central. The two that are outlying and represent the *Ice and Fire* of the series, which is **Daenerys and the icy threat beyond the wall**. This is [coming directly from GRRM himself at 4:55 of the interview ](https://youtu.be/GaPZGDlm2F4). 

So, there we have it, that is one of the very meanings. You may be asking yourself, where does Jon Snow fit into all of this? Is he categorized into the threat beyond the wall? Well, not necessarily although his storyline is heavily driven by it. Mainly no since he is a member of the Night’s Watch and looking to put an end to the threat; he is not necessarily the threat himself. But if you would like to categorize him into “Ice” because of this, you can certainly make an argument for it. 

At the time of the interview with GRRM that I linked, R+L= J was not revealed yet. This is important and probably why GRRM did not talk too much about all of the layers. Jon’s lineage does make his song one of Ice and Fire, for sure! In fact, this is even further supported if he is Azor Ahai reborn/ The Prince That Was Promised in the books as well — since Daenerys saw a vision where Rhaegar said his son with Elia Martell would have a song of Ice and Fire. Most presumably, Rhaegar got it wrong and this was likely an instance of foreshadowing for Jon Snow. 

Jon’s next couple of plot lines in the books are also going to represent this. He is going to have to unite Westeros in defeating the ice threat, the Others, and he’s also going to have to deal with Daenerys. This cannot possibly get any more “Ice and Fire” for him. Sure, but now let’s talk about the Fire in this story and why she’s important. 

Daenerys, throughout the entirety of the five books, has been in conflict with herself. We see her, this 15 year old girl, struggle with ruling and how it takes a mental toll on her. This is presented to us through her many visions, the voices she hears in her head, etc. She is not a Messiah or the hero coming to save the day like some people in Westeros believe, i.e. Aemon Targaryen, and at the end of ADWD she makes a major decision in choosing Fire and Blood. 

Uh oh, this doesn’t look so good for her! But we ultimately do see how the fire in this story is becoming a threat to humanity after all, she’s not just there and the reader is expected to think since AGoT that she is going to burn down all of the Seven Kingdoms. It’s a process. Simultaneously, when she gets to Westeros she has to deal with the Others, the convergence of Ice and Fire once and for all! 

...And Dany’s forces are all pretty much wiped out because of it (at least this is how I’m sure it will happen in the books). This makes the argument that Jon Snow ended both the Ice and Fire from the story invalid in some aspects. **The Others are being stopped because of Jon, yes, but also because of Daenerys who is putting everything on the line to help! And the others as well, Bran, Arya, etc., they will ALL have a major importance in defeating the Others.** There is a role for everyone and not one role is that much more significant than the others. Remember there is no Night King in the books as well, so not one person can be held accountably for killing him. 

Yes, Jon Snow *will* end Dany’s reign by killing her. He does put a definitive end to the threat of fire, even though you can argue Dany is much easier to handle since the Others took a toll on her forces. This makes him Azor Ahai/TPTWP (at least that is how I interpreted it), **but not the one that the story revolves around, as it is equally as important to see how Daenerys got to where she did, and her conflicts with herself and the Others,** how Tyrion got to where he did (I think he’s for sure taking a dark turn in the book), and etc. **Also, Jon’s decision to kill Dany will likely be influenced by the Starks, in saving them and the rest of the North, rather than simply “humanity” in Westeros.** 

At the end of the day, in terms of “Ice and Fire” I think you can definitely say **Dany and Jon are the biggest characters**, [again supported by GRRM](https://pizzabottle.com/44907-george-r-r-martin-said-jon-snow-daenerys-always-going-hook/). It is ultimately **their story to tell in THIS regard**. But in regards to everything happening in the middle? **The game of thrones?** **The very important house wars?** **No, there are still so many characters that embody this essential part of the story, and that is why there is no definitive main character.** 

#**THEMES** 

Yeah, this is another big one. I’m going to make it short since I don’t want to drag on for too long. But in terms of what the overall message(s) of this story are, I think Jon is a character who doesn’t embody them as much. I’d argue the themes pertaining to ambition, our dark human thoughts, the effects of war and age, apply more to characters like Tyrion, Dany, Arya, Jaime, Cersei, etc. I do think Jon being a bastard and sticking to his Stark roots at the end of the series despite finding out his actual parentage is **very** important however. 


**TLDR** - Jon Snow is not the main character of the series and neither is anyone else. “Ice and Fire” is a very layered meaning and it does not only apply to him. You can make the argument the biggest characters in terms of the “Ice and Fire” aspects of the series are Jon and Daenerys but there are other characters who better embody everything happening in the middle like Tyrion and Arya. Jon is a perfect example of doing heroic things but he’s not a savior, although the show completely missed the point in this regard, and I truly believe there are characters who carry out GRRM’s message more than he does.

Edit: I’m not denying there are not main characters to this story. I’m challenging the fact there is no one singular main character who has more importance than *everyone* else. Jon, Dany, Arya, Tyrion, and Bran are all perfect examples of this.",asoiaf
If Sansa ends up being Queen in the North at the end of ADOS and is married to Harrold Arryn (now lord of the Vale) will she also be Queen of the Vale? The same way Robb was also King of the Trident.

Heres an appreciation post for two small glimpses into the interactions between Joffrey and Renly.  I wish there were more.


Sansa did not understand. She looked at her prince. “Did I say something wrong, Your Grace? Why will he not speak to me?” 

“Ser Ilyn has not been feeling talkative these past fourteen years,” Lord Renly commented with a sly smile.  

Joffrey gave his uncle a look of pure loathing, then took Sansa’s hands in his own. “Aerys Targaryen had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.” “He speaks most eloquently with his -Sansa I AGOT

‘When she got to the part where she threw Joffrey’s sword into the middle of the Trident, Renly Baratheon began to laugh. The king bristled. “Ser Barristan, escort my brother from the hall before he chokes.” 


Lord Renly stifled his laughter. “My brother is too kind. I can find the door myself.” He bowed to Joffrey. “Perchance later you’ll tell me how a nine-year-old girl the size of a wet rat managed to disarm you with a broom handle and throw your sword in the river.” As the door swung shut behind him, Ned heard him say, “Lion’s Tooth,” and guffaw once more.’ Eddard 3 AGOT

"Season 8 had a lot of wasted opportunities in terms of narrative, but most people agree that the actors did their best with the material they were given. Emilia Clarke arguably did the best she could considering her material was especially bad, but Clarke is famous outside of GoT for her vivacious, honestly hilarious personality that she hardly ever gets to showcase in any of her dramatic work, much less so her role as Daenerys. Daenerys is one of the only main characters to never get any particularly lighthearted moments to help deepen her personality. *A Song of Ice and Fire* is obviously far from a lighthearted series overall, but it has its fair share of humour and dark comedy. Dany doesn't really get any in the books either, though there is some at her expense in *ADWD*.

But they had a good opportunity to amend that -- to give Clarke a chance to show off some greater range beyond being serious and queenly. After the Battle of Winterfell in S8, the armies of the living collectively get rat-arsed in well-earned celebration of their victory. Most of the characters get some fun drunken moments, but it's mostly characters you'd expect. In the aftermath of a battle that quite literally decided the fate of the entire planet that was won in the living's favour, I expected the afterparty to be bigger than what we got, and I later realised that it could've been great if we'd seen unexpected characters loosen up and enjoy the moment.

Seeing Daenerys actually get drunk may have even provided some much needed justification for the forced Mad Queen subplot. Scenes of Dany being properly, openly happy and joking around for once would've been entertaining, especially since Clarke can do silly comedy well. Daenerys is usually a bit of a stonewall-type character, so I'd have liked her to perhaps get unexpectedly angry with Jon in the middle of the party for his popularity among the Northmen and maybe even display some uncharacteristic cruelty towards him rather than just unsubtle dirty looks. I'm not talking Joffrey levels of cruelty, but enough to provide a similar level of tension that could make Daenerys' descent feel just a tad more natural than it was. Furthermore, alcoholism is a prominent trait throughout much of the Targaryen line, and is of course partly what drove ya boi Viserys to his downfall. D&amp;D are quite obsessed with parallels and doubling so it's a shame they missed out on this.

While this may not be a relevant observation, it's just something I feel would've been nice to include, for Emilia's sake more than anyone else's. While I may mistrust David ""I have balls and you don't"" Benioff and Dan ""Who rides a fucking dragon"" Weiss to write actually funny comedic moments after some poor attempts in the rest of Season 8, they could've let the actors adlib a bit.

TL;DR: Daenerys should've got drunk at the Winterfell party. A true *wasted* opportunity.",asoiaf

"Look I understand the Long Night according to in-universe writing is supposed to be incredibly bleak but my problem with the battle is that the way its paced it wants to start battle overwhelmingly bleak and hopeless and stays there for the entire duration of the battle which I feel harmed the episode in two ways:

1. In this case, it means the writers have to pull multiple contrivances out of their asses to get the main characters to this hopeless place. I mean consider the following advantages that should theoretically give the defenders a fighting chance against the Undead despite being outnumbered over 3 to 1 (according to game of thrones wiki estimates) like having the world's greatest light Calvery who are also among the world's greatest archers, having the world's greatest heavy infantry, having twice as many dragons as the enemy, being hold up in one of  Westeros's greatest castles, and being given time to prep defenses and create catapults. The showrunners, of course, went out of their way to make sure each every one of these advantages is either forgotten or used in the worse ways possible by characters who should know better.  

2. I also think it hurts the battle itself since by starting and maintain bleak and hopeless, it's hard to raise the stakes makes the battle feel overly samey despite some admirable attempts to add variety. Like, compare the Battle of Winterfell to Helms Deep where in the beginning there's hope as the defenders seem to hold their own (or at least inflict heavy casualties) against the numerically superior orc army so there's actually a big shock when the walls of helms deep are blown up and things fall apart. Hell, compare it to Battle of the Bastards where the battle starts out hopeless with near instant death via trampling but instead a chaotic but still survivable battle, which then, unfortunately, escalates into another damn near sure-death massacre when Jon and company are surrounded. Also it doesn't help that in one of it's very first scenes it has Jorah charge into a sure death situation and come back relatively unscathed telling the audience, ""don't worry your favorites will not die suddenly"" which really takes the bite out of the whole, bleak hopelessness vibe they're going for.

If you really wanted to raise the stakes and put them in a desperate situation the best way to do so I'd say is have the protagonists come up with a Blackwater-style crazy plan that initially seems to work but then backfires when the night king summons in his giant blizzard. Like for instance flanking the undead from both sides by the Knights of the Vale and the Dothraki while Dany cuts their army in two via a flame wall created by Drogon while the unsullied box them in from their remaining flank. The giant blinding fire smothering blizzard would cause said plan to backfire in an incredible way and probably put them in a situation where like in the original episode Greyworm needs to retreat but only I'd argue it would have much more weight behind it b/c again instead of going from losing to still losing, they went from maybe winning to losing.",asoiaf
"I was so pissed at the end of the show, that was definitely rushed and superficial, and honestly I was trying very hard to forget s7 and s8, putting all my hopes and dreams in the books. But then I started thinking: d&amp;d mistake was trying to condensate events that needed at least 3/4 for season in just 2 (with less episodes, to boot). If you think about it, though, George wants to do the exact same thing. I made a list of all the pov till ADWD.... it's over 20 characters, who are all in different parts of the world and stuck in situations with no quick resolution! When you finish read the ADWD, the feeling is that you're in the middle of the story, maybe, but definitely far from the end. Don't forget George had to divide AFFC and ADWD in two, precisely because there were too many characters to handle in just one book. What makes he think that he can do it now?  If he puts in the TWOW all the povs, it will have to be one or two chapter maybe per pov, and how can he solve everyone's issue in so little space?

"How would you feel if tomorrow GRRM announced that the next mainline ASoIaF book was being released this year, but it wasn't The Winds of Winter? If he told us that he'd made the decision to expand to eight books, that now he's releasing ""A Call for Krakens"" or ""An Elegy for Summer"" and *then* he'll write TWoW and ADoS?

Personally, I'd mostly be really pleased to finally be getting the conclusion to ADwD and some new content, and support whatever makes it easier for him to finish the story as he wants it to be. I'd be hopeful that wrestling with the manuscript length and resisting the extension was ironically what's been taking so long, and now we might be back on track, especially if the new book succeeding in rejoining the various plot threads.",asoiaf
"Do we have any ideas/theories at all regarding what ADoS will be about? I know it’s far away and the very last book of the series, but...I do know that TWOW is essentially going to be the most thrilling, highly anticipated, and important conclusion to the saga. It’s going to start with a ton of battles and have a lot of storylines and character arcs explained/wrapped up, *and* a lot of deaths, while other characters who haven’t been around for awhile will likely return/make an appearance and have a role to play. I assume it’ll be incredibly fast paced and a lot of things will probably be different from the show (or the same in some aspects, but written better/differently), with a hopefully satisfactory end. So, assuming both of the final books will be released, I’m looking forward to them. But, after TWOW ends, what more could GRRM have planned for his series? He’s very creative and always seems to have a lot to say/write about regarding the world he created, so maybe he’ll surprise us with even more discoveries to his world than we thought (like the west of Westeros, or unknown things about characters which somehow tie into the story.) I have the impression that a central part of ADoS will be about the Starks, considering the original title was called “A Time for Wolves”, but that’s about the only clue I have. I think it’ll most likely be an “aftermath of everything” sort of thing involving a time jump, but it’s hard to tell.

"**I was rewatching season 5 recently, and I noticed a certain familiar pattern. It goes like this:**


• Daenerys captures a member of the Sons of Harpy

• She chooses not to execute him, and keep him as a prisoner for a time

• One of her supporters, a freed slave, disagrees, and suggests executing the prisoner, his judgement clouded by the wrongs the Sons of Harpy did to him, and his family

• Daenerys doesn’t agree with him, and still decides to spare the prisoner, untill there’s a fair trial 

• Despite this, the freed slave goes against his Queen’s orders, and kills the prisoner anyway

• Dany decides to execute the freed slave, her supporter, for this crime

• Because of this, the other freed slaves start turning against her


**Now let’s remind ourselves of the Karstark situation:**


• Robb captures two Lannister hostages

• He chooses not to execute them, and keep them prisoners for a time

• Lord Karstark disagrees, and suggests executing the prisoners, his judgement clouded by the wrongs Lannisters did to him, and his family

• Robb doesn’t agree with him, and still decides to spare them

• Lord Karstark decides to kill them anyway, going against his King’s orders.

• Robb executes Lord Karstark, one of his bannerman.

• Because of this, a huge portion of his army turns against him


And since the Dany plot is original to the show, I’m just left asking... why use the almost exact same thing twice? The only differences between these two plot points was that the Son of the Harpy was undeniably more guilty that the two Lannister boys (but that wasn’t important in any way,) and of course Robb suffering proper consequences for his actions. 

(This is not a “D&amp;D bad” sort of post, to be honest I kinda gave up on the show long ago, when I noticed them continuously skipping important character moments (like Tysha confession for example) and then wondering why are they suddenly dealing with a bunch of underdeveloped characters with no idea how to get them where they want them to be.)

"Jojen: “I dreamed that the sea was lapping all around Winterfell. I saw black waves crashing against the gates and towers, and then the salt water came flowing over the walls and filled the castle. Drowned men were floating in the yard.”

Bran believes this refers to when Theon and the ironborn, representing the sea, take the castle and kill those Jojen sees dead in the yard. However, I believe this green dream hasn’t been fully realized yet.

Jojen describes the sea as lapping all around Winterfell, with waves *crashing against the gates and towers.* This describes the castle being stormed from all sides at once, with several gates being attacked. This is **not** an accurate telling of the Capture of Winterfell! Theon sends 4 men stealthily over the walls, who then fight their way to a gate and open it for the rest of the ironmen. Not exactly the salt water “flowing over the walls.”

I think in actuality this will refer to the when Winterfell is eventually stormed by the Others and their scores of the dead. In the dream, the “sea” and “black waves crashing against the gates” would refer to wights attacking the castle. This is a thematically consistent metaphor as “the sea” has been used in association with death/the dead before, most notably in Patchface’s prophetic ramblings. Of course, this would mean the Others/wights will succeed in taking Winterfell by direct force. Thoughts?

Edit: I almost forgot the most important part! Jojen also says ""**In the dark of night** the salt sea will flow over these walls."" Of course, the ironborn attack Winterfell at night, but I think it would make more sense for ""the dark of night"" in a magical prophetic dream to refer to the Long Night.",asoiaf

"I know there are several posts like this all over reddit, but I didn't see any still open for discussion and I need to talk to someone about this. Also, all of those posts were surprisingly positive toward Ned, many of the posts using some wording of the idea: ""His game was good, just not good enough."" This baffles me. I don't even mean to be a dick about it, but Ned's game seems just terrible to me, nowhere close to good.

He didn't start off as bad as possible, his time as Hand (when not looking into Jon Arryns murder) seemed tame until he sent people after The Mountain. But that was dumb and everything unraveled from there. He pretended he existed in some magical non-political world even though he knew Jamie had been allowed free after assaulting Ned and murdering Ned's men for political reasons, which should have been an obvious wake up call. He also was well aware that they murdered the last Hand and planned to murder the King but then continued poking the Lannisters in the eye over and over as if there'd be no consequences. But even all of that can be chalked up to a ""lack of political instincts"" as I've seen some people phrase it, and is not as bad compared to exactly how he handled the ""post-Robert's death"" coup.

He just didn't plan anything. He had barely any loyal men on hand, trusting Littlefinger of all people to get the loyalty of the City Watch. That's the obvious mistake, but it's just one in a long string. And it's not like we were still getting used to Littlefinger. We knew what he was, and Ned of all people knew. No sane person in this position would have called on Littlefinger when faced with this kind of situation. It just doesn't make sense. Why was Renly not his first call when he decided what he was doing?

What was his deal with Renly in general? Renly offered him help, he turned it down, changed his mind, never contacted Renly to tell him he changed his mind, and then was shocked to hear that Renly had skipped town. That's not even a lack of political sense, that's a lack of common sense or basic intelligence. If I ask you to do something, anything, and I say no, I should assume that you are working under the idea that I said No until I tell you otherwise, because that's literally what I told you. I seriously can't wrap my head around this one.

This hits on a larger point that applies to all his mistakes: You can be an honorable man, and still foresee the actions of your enemies that will be dishonorable. He's not just a naive honorable Lord, he's a dumb person to point out how dishonorable everyone is and then be shocked when they act dishonorably. Like he can choose to live as virtuously as he pleases, but he was more delusional than anyone if he bought into the things he told himself. His thoughts to himself like ""*What? The Queen hasn't run off?? What a fool?""* almost felt unrealistically naive. There's no way a grown man thought that she would leave. She held all the power.

And if he thought anyone would take his side, without him talking to any of them personally, just because they heard him prattling on about hair colors and true born Baratheons, then he doesn't understand how any of this works. He never even presented his evidence to anyone he could trust in the slightest. Like, idk, Robert! Or Ser Barristan, who certainly wouldn't have supported any coup or anything, but would have listened to the truth if he could prove it was the truth. Or, again, Renly!

My final point that I cannot get over is his timing. He goes out of his way to mention how his daughters safety is important to him. So he thinks *Ok, they'll be gone in 3 days, and I know that the Lannisters are actively planning Robert's demise, so what if I meet with the Queen and reveal my whole plan, giving her time to make me regret everything.* Why would he speak a word of this while his girls were still in KL? He specifically says he will wait, and then he meets with Cersei. I don't know what the consensus on this is, but I assume this meeting directly lead to Robert's ""death by boar"". I always assumed there was no way he died just naturally in a hunting accident. So Ned is the one who caused the events to happen before he was ready.

Looking back on this post now, it may seem like I'm just not accepting that he was naive and inexperienced with politics, but it feels like more than that. He had run Winterfell for what, 16 years. He had put down rebellions, he had dealt with the politics of his bannermen, etc. Some of the stuff he seemed inexperienced with, he should have been comfortable with by now. He should have known not to thin his guard out like he did, or to trust the Lannister owned city guard, or the snakes on the council. This was all stuff we know he knew.

I realize not everyone will agree with me, but before I get flooded with responses I do want to say that I get what the character is supposed to be. He's a naive northerner who actually cares about his people and decides things with honor in mind, not politics. I get that. But several times, Ned mentions a concern he has in his thoughts, and then just doesn't act on it, as if the problem will go away. He doesn't trust the Lannisters to play fair, he doesn't trust the council to be loyal, he knows he has to get his girls out of the city, he knows Robert is in trouble, etc etc. But all of the bad stuff he worries about happens anyway, because....? I'm not really sure. My answer is, I think, he's just not a smart human being. I'm having trouble seeing it any other way.

If anyone has any other explanation for any of this besides doubling down on his political naivety, I'd really like to hear it.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr:

Why did he come at the Lannisters while his girls were still in Kings Landing? Why didn't he talk to Renly at all after deciding to go for the coup? And why was Littlefinger more trusted than Renly? Also, why does Honorable = Stupid in this world?

To me, everything he did was not the actions of a naive honorable man who's unaccustomed to politics, but a reckless moron with no care for the safety of his family or his country.",asoiaf

"While rewatching last season finale, this reflection came to my mind. 

Dany’s descent to madness arc is relatable to Gollum’s character arc in LOTR. They were good people who find themselves obsessed with an object (The Iron Throne=The Ring) and that obsession corrumpted them in their noble hearts. 

I know, last season was a mess. This particular part of her character arc was so badly developed that is almost non realistic. But I think this sounds like GRRM’s writing and is very likely to be in the books too. And it’s also known that GRRM took some aspects of LOTR’s characters to write ASOIAF (Frodo = Jon Snow, Ned Stark = Gandalf, etc) 

But I’ll feel more real and human. In the books, Dany wants to sail to Westeros because she thinks she has to, because is her right. It’s predestination. Not specifically an obsession.

But deep inside, she’s just looking for her place in the world. A place that feels like home. As she felt in her childhood, when she lived in the house with the red door. She has that fantasy that in Westeros she’ll find peace within herself. 

Maybe this will be her tragedy, not the obsession with power. It’s her obsession with something more abstract (and a little bit nobler) than a Throne: home.

What claim did Jon Arryn and Ned Stark have to the Iron Throne and what was Robert’s claim that was better than the two? Don’t talk about his Targaryen grandmother because she did not exist in AGoT.

&gt; From AGoT:

&gt; Many of the lords bannermen wanted to march on Harrenhal at once, to meet Lord Tywin and end Lannister power for all time. Young, hot-tempered Marq Piper urged a strike west at Casterly Rock instead. Still others counseled patience. Riverrun sat athwart the Lannister supply lines, Jason Mallister pointed out; let them bide their time, denying Lord Tywin fresh levies and provisions while they strengthened their defenses and rested their weary troops. Lord Blackwood would have none of it. They should finish the work they began in the Whispering Wood. March to Harrenhal and bring Roose Bolton’s army down as well. What Blackwood urged, Bracken opposed, as ever; Lord Jonos Bracken rose to insist they ought pledge their fealty to King Renly, and move south to join their might to his.

&gt; “Renly is not the king,” Robb said. It was the first time her son had spoken. Like his father, he knew how to listen.

&gt; “You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord,” Galbart Glover said. “He put your father to death.”

&gt; “That makes him evil,” Robb replied. “I do not know that it makes Renly king. Joffrey is still Robert’s eldest trueborn son, so the throne is rightfully his by all the laws of the realm. Were he to die, and I mean to see that he does, he has a younger brother. Tommen is next in line after Joffrey.”

&gt; “Tommen is no less a Lannister,” Ser Marq Piper snapped.

&gt; “As you say,” said Robb, troubled. “Yet if neither one is king, still, how could it be Lord Renly? He’s Robert’s younger brother. Bran can’t be Lord of Winterfell before me, and Renly can’t be king before Lord Stannis.”

&gt; Lady Mormont agreed. “Lord Stannis has the better claim.”

&gt; “Renly is _crowned_,” said Marq Piper. “Highgarden and Storm’s End support his claim, and the Dornishmen will not be laggardly. If Winterfell and Riverrun add their strength to his, he will have five of the seven great houses behind him. Six, if the Arryns bestir themselves! Six against the Rock! My lords, within the year, we will have all their heads on pikes, the queen and the boy king, Lord Tywin, the Imp, the Kingslayer, Ser Kevan, _all_ of them! That is what we shall win if we join with King Renly. What does Lord Stannis have against that, that we should cast it all aside?”

&gt; “The right,” said Robb stubbornly. Catelyn thought he sounded eerily like his father as he said it.

&gt; “So you mean us to declare for Stannis?” asked Edmure.

&gt; “I don’t know,” said Robb. “I prayed to know what to do, but the gods did not answer. The Lannisters killed my father for a traitor, and we know that was a lie, but if Joffrey is the lawful king and we fight against him, we _will_ be traitors.”

Well, that was interesting! Don’t forget that the letter of Stannis did not exist in AGoT. No one knew the twincest while this council took place. Apparently, “Robb’s Rebellion” was a thing and it was meant to be a copy of Robert’s Rebellion. It was a rebellion against an evil yet still seemingly lawful king.

Even if Robb’s argument was right and Joffrey ceased to be the lawful king for being a tyrant just like Aerys, what about Joffrey’s siblings? What about Viserys and Dany for that matter?

&gt; From AGoT:

&gt; “MY LORDS!” he shouted, his voice booming off the rafters. “Here is what I say to these two kings!” He spat. “Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine, from some flowery seat in Highgarden or Dorne? What do they know of the Wall or the wolfswood or the barrows of the First Men? Even their _gods_ are wrong. The Others take the Lannisters too, I’ve had a bellyful of them.” He reached back over his shoulder and drew his immense two-handed greatsword. “Why shouldn’t we rule ourselves again? It was the dragons we married, and the dragons are all dead!” He pointed at Robb with the blade. “_There_ sits the only king I mean to bow _my_ knee to, m’lords,” he thundered. “The King in the North!”

I don’t believe Greatjon was talking figuratively when he mentioned marrying dragons. Was there some sort of Targaryen-Stark marriage back in the day, which would also explain how Ned could have a claim to the Iron Throne as implied in the same book?

&gt; From ACoK:

&gt; Renly shrugged. “Tell me, what right did my brother Robert ever have to the Iron Throne?” He did not wait for an answer. “Oh, there was talk of the blood ties between Baratheon and Targaryen, of weddings a hundred years past, of second sons and elder daughters. No one but the maesters care about any of it. Robert won the throne with his warhammer.”

ACoK is the first time GRRM revealed marriage ties between Baratheons and Targaryens which proved the legal part of Robert’s claim. Note that this happens after the massive expansion of the saga. But still, the text reads like GRRM has not figured out the details of how Robert had Targaryen ancestry. That would have to wait for AFfC.

My speculation is that there was indeed past Targaryen marriages for Baratheons, Starks, Arryns and even Lannisters at the earliest conception of the story, which would all give them varying degrees of claims to the Targaryen seat. There is no other way to explain all the clues from the 1993 outline and AGoT.

And guess what? After the world expanded, GRRM still retained some of these marriages in various forms, although changing his mind about which characters should have Targaryen blood.

1. Baratheons were given a very recent Targaryen ancestry because GRRM felt that it was essential to explain Robert’s coronation.

1. Lannisters seem to have lost any possible Targaryen ancestry; unless GRRM has plans to provide them through Viserys Plumm’s daughter.

1. Arryns had three marriages with the Targaryens but none of them ended up providing Targaryen ancestry to Jon Arryn.

1. Starks were also explicitly forbidden by GRRM from Targaryen ancestry for some reason. Interestingly, GRRM played with the idea of the “Pact of Ice and Fire” and the rumor of a northern type marriage/bedding between a Targaryen prince and the bastard daughter of Lord Stark.

King Bran might have been among the earliest plans of GRRM while the Starks still had Targaryen ancestry and thus a claim to unified Westeros; but that ship has sailed long time ago.",asoiaf

"right after he killed dany. What duty he hasn't served? Light God brought him back to fight the night King. He could've died at the battle of winterfell as long as the night king was killed eventually. Like Melisandra and Lord fire sword. He survived the battle of winterfell to be living goddess dany's only weakness. Light God may not desire a living goddess.

If Jon suicided, grey worm departing to naarth would make more sense. No Queen, no ally, alien land. Better leave. Lords of westero would gladly let unsullied go. Imp would have been executed under such situation. Imp was in charge of treason and suspected to lure Jon in killing dany.

Then, no more seven kingdoms. The better world is a divided realm.",asoiaf
"(Spoilers Main) In rereading Game of Thrones, I found this gem during the Catelyn chapter of Tyrion’s trial by combat. In this scene, Catelyn and Ser Rodrik discuss the death of Jon Arryn and whether the Lannisters did it. Cat blames the Lannister, but still has doubt in her mind. She laments that she read the letter Lysa sent her and then spies her nephew. She says to Ser Rodrik that he would never become a true lord unless he was taken from his mother for a time. This comment springs a larger conversation about how Lysa was against Robin’s fostering. George RR Martin was dangling the truth in front of us the whole time. That’s the value of rereading. 

EDIT: The conversation ends before Maester Colemon can tell Cat that Jon planned to foster him at the Rock",asoiaf
"King Bran is foreshadowed in the books. I just finished his second chapter in my re-read, and there's already more than a few hints.

First and foremost: Bran has the first chapter in the series, besides the prologue. In that chapter, his father tells him that a man who hands down a death sentence should execute the sentence himself, so he can look the condemned in the eye and hear any last words they may have. Martin could easily have written this scene from Jon's, Robb's, or Ned's point of view. Martin had to have a reason for making this chapter the first one. Granted, the last half of the chapter was the first scene Martin came up with, before he knew anything about the overall story or the world. But Martin has never mentioned the execution scene when he talks about how he came up with the story. And it's easy for me to see Ned's philosophy coming into play in Bran's last viewpoint chapter, whether he judges Jon or not.

There are two lines in Bran's second chapter that become a lot more interesting when read with the endgame in mind. When Bran thinks about going south with his father, he
&gt;had been marking the days on his wall, eager to depart, to see a world he had only dreamed of and begin a life he could scarcely imagine.

Earlier in that same paragraph, Bran dreams of becoming a Kingsguard. He never once thinks about becoming king. So if he does go South in DoS, it will be the begin a life he ""scarcely imagined."" I may be reading to much into this particular line.

The second line is another matter. After climbing to the top of a tree, he looks down on Winterfell and
&gt;it made him feel like he was lord of the castle, in a way even Robb would never know.

Robb wasn't named king until well after he left Winterfell. But if Bran becomes king, he will rule Winterfell in a way Robb never did. I could see Bran actually ""ruling"" from Winterfell too. I don't see Bran becoming king the way he did in the show; I refuse to believe Martin will drop the magical elements of Bran's arc like the show did.

I'm excited to keep reading and see if there are any more hints scattered across the books. Knowing Martin's style and technique, I imagine there will be.",asoiaf
"With how the show ends, it’s clear there isn’t much significance put into white walkers. They’re a plot device used to push northerners and wildlings into conflict and to promote an overarching sense of doom. It’s unnecessary. There’s enough history between the free folk and southerners that just the threat of a wildling army would’ve been enough to unite the north instead of needing to turn to extremes of the fantasy realm. The nights watch/Jon could’ve still plead to the 7 kingdoms for help and been ignored even though they are a huge threat because cerci would’ve wanted her enemies to be weaker prior to her launching a northern assault.

Now for the dragons. Though her army was pretty useless against the walkers, they would’ve made for an interesting fight vs the Lannister’s, grey joys, and golden company. Her brutal path to the throne could’ve been much more exciting if she wasn’t able to fix all her problems by saying dracarys. She still could’ve bought the unsullied (perhaps with long lost targ heirlooms) and her burning the Khals and gaining the Dothrakis support would’ve happened again with or without the dragons. These medieval nuclear bombs handicap the story.",asoiaf
Robert Baratheon is a second cousin to Rhaegar Targaryen and obviously be killed him on the trident. Robert Baratheon was also chosen to rule because of his dragon blood (doesn’t have much). Does no one know that they are related or what is the deal?,asoiaf
Shireen obviously got sacrificed in the show in an attempt by Stannis to save his dying cause. We all know that it not only didn't cause any magic to occur but also caused many of his mercenaries to abandon him. It seems like the sacrifice was taken from George even though I believe it will happen in a different context. If/when Shireen is sacrificed do you think it will be for nothing like it was in the show? And in what context do you see it happening. I could imagine Mel convincing Selyse to do it while Stannis is away. This would make sense just based on where they are on the map right now although it would undercut Stannis's storyline.,asoiaf
"There once was a Frenchman named Camus. He wrote a lot. One of the things he wrote was an essay titled [""The Myth of Sisyphus.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus) This essay is taken as the central Camus text on the absurd. If you are too lazy to Ctrl+T and search wikipedia for ""absurdism,"" here's what the free online encyclopedia has to say for you:

&gt;...man's futile search for meaning, unity, and clarity in the face of an unintelligible world devoid of God and eternal truths or values.

Hey, an unintelligible world devoid of God and eternal truths or values? You know what that sounds like? Westeros! (Planetos/GRRTH are also acceptable answers). 

The most famous line from Camus' essay is [the final one](http://dbanach.com/sisyphus.htm): 

&gt;The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.

(Of course, the myth of Sisyphus is the myth of the man in Hades doomed to forever roll a boulder up a mountain, only to have the boulder come crashing back to the bottom again. Sisyphus is forever rolling a boulder up a mountain, for no purpose other than the roll of the boulder. You might say that the climb is all there is). 

At the end of *Game of Thrones*, two characters in particular are faced with Sisyphean tasks: Tyrion and Bran. Especially Tyrion. For Tyrion, his Handship is no longer a position of privilege. He's not being made Hand as an extension of his father's will, part of a corrupt noble bloodline rotting away beneath the throne. Rather, he is being made Hand because it is how he will serve people. Because he deserves it - not in the ""I was born for this/I am a Lannister/I am the blood of the dragon"" sense, but because it is something that he needs to do to build a better world for other people. Will he succeed? It hardly matters. As he says to Jon: ""ask me again in ten years."" The seven kingdoms (six kingdoms?) are his boulder, and he had best set his shoulder to the task and get pushing. One must imagine Tyrion happy; the struggle itself is enough to fill a man's heart. 

Bran, too, is here to serve, and the future is no plainly-written thing for him. Despite the many, many posts to the contrary, Bran is not omniscient, nor does he know what's going to happen next. He has extra help, certainly, but he's not on easy street. Tyrion crowns Bran, though, for a reason: the creation of meaning against an absurd world. To quote Camus, Tyrion ""makes of fate a human matter, which must be settled among men."" There is no one bloodline that is fated to rule over all others; controlling a magical creature like a dragon doesn't confer some utter divinity over all other humans. Tyrion chooses Bran's story, and that is because it is a human story, ultimately, not a story about a dragon-woman or the prince who was promised. A story about being broken! 

At the very end of the show, for just a moment, Jon Snow turns back and looks toward the Wall. He looks south and reflects on his life. The meaning that he thought existed is no longer there. He isn't a Stark of Winterfell or a Targaryen of Dragonstone. He's himself. In the words of Camus: ""His fate belongs to him. His rock is a thing."" In fact, to quote more extensively, you could almost imagine this as a description of Jon's last scene:

&gt;At that subtle moment when man glances backward over his life, Sisyphus returning toward his rock, in that slight pivoting he contemplates that series of unrelated actions which become his fate, created by him, combined under his memory's eye and soon sealed by his death. Thus, convinced of the wholly human origin of all that is human, a blind man eager to see who knows that the night has no end, he is still on the go. The rock is still rolling.

Now, I don't think *Game of Thrones* or ASOIAF are absurd texts entirely. There's too much Romance in the story for that. But the fates of our protagonists, beating on like boats against the current, speak to the acceptance that there is no mighty Fate or Destiny or R'hllor controlling us and giving secret meaning to our lives. Rather, all that matters is, to quote Gandalf, ""what to do with the time that is given us."" There are strange forces out there, sure - Bran is a wizard, literally. But in fact, that in and of itself is what makes the world absurd! The inability for us to explain things in a purely rational way - that's the absurd at work. The great contradiction between the search for meaning and and the unreasonable world. Camus argued that recognition of that contradiction - not acceptance, but recognition - was the only path forward for the absurd man. I think Camus might have agreed with Jojen Reed when Jojen said ""if ice can burn, then love and hate can mate."" The existence of two contradictory things together, forever. A song of ice and fire. 

Isaac Hempstead-Wright, who played King Bran the Broken himself, [penned an essay](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-series-finale-bran-stark-as-king-explained-isaac-hempstead-wright-guest-column-1212195) about the end of *Game of Thrones*. It's quite a good read, and a good reflection on his career as a young kid growing into a man through *Game of Thrones*. But there's one line that stood out in particular:

&gt;Life doesn’t have neat, happy endings; it is ambiguous and ultimately inconsequential.

Ambiguous and ultimately inconsequential. And yet, one must imagine Westeros happy.",asoiaf
"It seems to me that Stannis is fixed on this idea that he is the the rightful ruler, and he actually is if you go by succession. But does the throne belong to him? There's already 2 precedents we know of where people ignored all the succession and installed themselves on the throne, Aegon and Robert. Hell, one of them is his brother. Was Aegon the rightful ruler? Was Robert the rightful ruler? If Stannis applies the logic properly then the throne should go to Daenerys and Robert is an usurper. And even further back the thrones belonged to whatever people were ruling the kingdoms. And you can go even further of course.

The point is Renly wasn't necessarily in the wrong, he had the army, he had the power, why not just take the throne by force, like other ""legitimate"" rulers before him. Idk..it's a funny thing I thought about Stannis while reading. He's entitled.",asoiaf

"" There’s a lot that I love about Sansa. She’s one of the few child POVs that convincingly passes for an actual child, unlike, say, Jon or Dany who seem like adult brains in children’s bodies. But despite her naïveté, she’s a very engaging POV character. She’s perceptive, weighing all the possible meanings of things said to her and done around her, showing great political instinct despite a less-than-wholistic education. Most of all I love that she’s strong. She’s been through hell and it’s only made her wiser, not crueler or more vengeful or hateful. Where Arya has become pure self-destruction, Catelyn has become a paragon of vengeance, and Tyrion is all bitterness and self pity, Sansa is taking control of her life and using the agency available to her to advance her own interests without becoming a monster. Can’t wait to watch her calmly remove Littlefinger from the game board, then finish her lemoncake like a true QITN."" - u/Muffinman908

"" What makes Sansa such a good character is her simplicity. She doesn't have three dragons, a sword, or have any magical abilities (that we've seen yet, as I believe GRRM has said she is a warg), however, she's still an incredibly nuanced, interesting, and layered character. Her metamorphosis from naive teenage girl to hardened young woman is perhaps the best character arc in the entirey of ASOIAF. I also love how she has stayed true to herself throughout her journey in that she has never shunned her femininity and instead chosen to embrace it and simultaneously utilize it as a weapon (""A lady's armor is courtesy""). In short, I just love her and can't wait for her further development in TWOW/ADOS."" - u/EmFly15

"" Stannis is my favorite character because of his dedication to the Law and how he sees Kingship as a duty and not a right. He goes north to defend the Wall, he has a lowborn smuggler as a top advisor, he is in the process of ridding the North of the Ironborn and the Boltons, he is absolutely relentless in his goals. Stannis does not want the Throne, it is his, by rights. He lives up to the titles that he inherited, “Protector of the Realm”. Stannis isn’t perfect, not by a longshot, but he is the best chance Westeros has for peace and a fighting chance against the Others. Stannis Baratheon is the One True King. "" - u/WebCrusader_5

"Remember how the show is named ‘Game of Thrones’ and not ‘A song of ice and fire’. 
 
The reason given to us was because HBO thought the title was too long and GOT sold better. But their statement became the best example of irony I’ve seen.

The name of the book series probably (almost cause of R+L=J) is referring to Jon Snow and how he’s central character of the universe and has a bigger role to play.

The show kinda forgot that (joke intended). Jon was reduced to being a side character to Daenerys in S7&amp;8. His only important scene was killing Daenerys which wasn’t even well explained (the change of his heart was too sudden and obviously bad writing). And the long night wasn’t the most important storyline, atleast according to the writers.

I believe GRRM is not going to let Jon out so easy. Jon has probably a lot of things to do in the books then we realise. And atleast the theory of Rhaegar’s son being the Prince that was Promised is probably true and Jon might be the one to stop the Others. 

The show didn’t care about his story and let itself play out the way the title suggests and that probably made D&amp;D think they’re too smart cause they can claim that our story was different that the books cause of the name. 

But it’s just my thinking. Let me know what you think.",asoiaf
Holy shit what?! WUT?! I've been reading the books for the first time these past couple of months. Up to this point there have been a fair number of differences from the show but nothing like what I just read. I don't even know how to process this. The bitch is back!?,asoiaf
"It can be a big plot point that you really liked, but I'm thinking more side quests, character development, or interactions that may or may not appear in the books.

For me, I would really love it if Jaime knights Brienne in the books like he does in the show. I don't *think* it will happen, but I'm rooting for it nonetheless.",asoiaf
"So in the series, we see that the Night's Watch is in urgent need of men. It's currently used as a prison of sorts, but most men would rather be gelded or die than spend their lives in service to the Night's Watch.

&amp;#x200B;

However, from Jon's chapters, I get the sense that for the youngest recruits, the Night's Watch acts sort of like a military school or training. Jon, Sam and their friends do a lot of maturing there.

&amp;#x200B;

Why not just make the Night's Watch a place where noble families can send off their 2nd and 3rd born sons for a few years? It might be hard to get them to send their heirs but I think such an idea could improve comradery between the houses. Sons of Northern houses interacting with lads from the Vale, Riverlands and Stormlands who they wouldn't normally get to see and build friendships with.

&amp;#x200B;

Let the smallfolk send their boys too. Most smallfolk as seen from Dunk and Egg and Jon's chapters have no idea how to fight with proper weapons having no prior training. Give them the promise of 3 meals a day, proper sword training and a bed to sleep in and I believe some would come.

&amp;#x200B;

I would make it a 3-5 year stint, eliminating the Watch's biggest drawback, serving for life and making the idea more likely to get off the ground in the first place. The older recruits could also train the younger ones during their final days. I can imagine a lot of Randall Tarlys (albeit not as big of a douchebag as the original version) sending their sons off to ""make men out of them"".

&amp;#x200B;

It also has to be remembered that not all the Night's Watchmen act as rangers and go beyond the wall, so for quite a number of recruits, the biggest danger would be the harsh conditions and wildings who manage to get past the wall.",asoiaf
"As the show came to an end I decided it was high time to read the books. I am on the second part of ASOS and can't help to notice hints and details that, to someone who has already seen the show, obviously hints that the Red Wedding is coming.

For those of you that read the books before seeing the show, did you see the RW coming? Did you pick up on the details in the work that are so noticable when you know what it will all ultimately lead to?

I am very curious to what your reactions were when reading or seeing the Red Wedding for the first time!",asoiaf
"There is a lot of speculation out there about what Jon will be like when he returns to life in TWOW. It seems that the general consensus is that the experience of dying, and being resurrected, will significantly change his personality, and he won't be the Jon that we all know and love. The basis for this argument is that Lady Stoneheart is significantly different from Catelyn, and Beric Dondarion made it clear that he was not the same man he was prior to resurrections by Thoros. 


However, Jon's circumstances may not be the same as those of LSH and BD.  LSH was dead for weeks prior to her resurrection, and BD clearly states that he loses a part of who he was with each subsequent resurrection. Therefore if Jon is resurrected relatively quickly, and only once, he may well be similar to the Jon we see at the end of DWD. 

It seems that the key question becomes, how long will Jon be dead before Melisandre brings him back to life? The resurrection can't happen immediately (as it did with BD in most cases) because he has to be dead long enough for everyone to know he is dead. This will be the technicality that will allow him to  be released from his oath to the NW, and free to venture south without being considered to be a deserter.  However, it seems likely that he won't be dead for a long time either. Maybe only a few hours. The reason this seems likely is that his corpse will be surrounded by multiple people who are inclined to burn dead bodies due to the danger of them becoming wights. In addition, he has no home to return his bones to (WF is in the hands of the Boltons, and Jon is a bastard). He has no family who remain to bury him. Why would they preserve his dead body for an extended period of time? 


It doesn't seem logical that he would be dead for days prior to being resurrected. Therefore, it may be that he is very similar to the JS who died at the end of DWD.",asoiaf

"This is something I've been mulling over for a bit, and after reading a couple of posts today, thought it would be appropriate.

This is primarily centered on Dany's endgame in the show and why I think it will be the same in the books, but also is more broadly about how Martin likes to have parallel characters/events in different story arcs.

**So, to start with two less controversial examples:**

In ACOK, Jon/Theon has a mentor figure, Halfhand/Cleftjaw, known for a disfiguring injury and celebrated as a badass because they didn't let that injury phase them in battle, and instead gruesomely and awesomely killed their opponent.

Also between AGOT and ACOK, various characters have sort of shady friends/allies.  Arya has Jaqen, Sansa has Sandor, Tyrion had Bronn, Bran has Osha, Davos has Saan, and Theon has ""Reek"".  In fact, you could also look at say Bronn, Davos, and Janos as similar but contrasting takes on the ennobled up-jumped commoner"".

Obviously, there are some pretty big differences between these examples and some are more of a stretch than others, but I think/hope this gets at how Martin likes to use parallels.

**Now for the more controversial part:**

So, in AFFC and ADWD, you have a female POV character Cersei/Dany/Arianne/Asha who wants respect and is haunted by the shadow of their brother Tyrion/Viserys/Quentyn/Theon.  They are attracted to a ""bad boy"" Aurane Waters/Daario/Darkstar/Qarl, generally a sign of bad judgment, and ignore a ""nice guy"" Jaime (okay, this one is kind of a stretch)/Quentyn/Oakheart or Dalt or Daemon Sand (Arianne is busy)/Trisstofer, also generally as a sign of bad judgment.

And with Dany and Cersei specifically, both of their arcs also have them ordering the torture of essentially innocent people.

Now again, there are some important differences between arcs.  Like for example, Qarl is actually a good guy/ presented as a good choice and similarly, Asha doesn't really have that aspect of ""not as smart as she thinks she is"" that is a large element of Cersei, Arianne, and Dany's characterization, but I think what these parallels highlight is that while these other characters are definitely contrasted with Cersei and have much better motivations, they aren't necessarily being presented as examples of good female rulers as a contrast to her as an example of a bad female ruler (if you are looking for that, you should probably be looking to Sansa and  possibly Asha).

To the contrary, Martin seems to show their actions having a lot of similarities (and dare I say uses the same sexist stereotypes) even if their actions differ.

**What does this mean?:**

So, with that background in mind, Jon Con in the book is definitely going to commit an atrocity spurred on by the sound of bells.  But that doesn't rule out Dany also committing an atrocity (bells optional).  It's kind of like how Martin takes pain to show Hoster Tully committing war crimes and abusively poling a child's sexuality in ways that are similar (if less insanely evil) than those of Tywin.  Again, good/different intentions is not a predictor of good/different actions.

And yes, Cersei in the books is definitely going to be killed by Jaime, probably in reaction to her doing something really evil and/or to stop her from doing something really evil.  But that doesn't rule out Jon also killing Dany in reaction to her doing something really evil and/or to stop her from doing something really evil.  Is it sexist, probably.  Does it line up with parallels between the characters, also probably.

Lastly, tangentially related to the above, this is also why for example, I wouldn't necessarily think that Gendry being legitimized in the show is just him taking over Edric's book plotline (no reason both couldn't be legitimized in the books), even though the inherited Edric's role as a potential human sacrifice.  Or similarly, I wouldn't assume that Bronn in the show was just taking over Brown Ben Plumm's book plotline, especially because the book itself (and Tyrion himself) frames Ben as a replacement Bronn.

Thoughts?

**Addendum:**

I realize that I didn't get into another big one- the assumptions that Jon is absorbing all or part of Young Griff's storyline.  Honestly, I really am not sure myself about that one (among other things, I think there is good basis for Jon's ""real name"" being Aegon, Aemon, or even Jahaerys).  But also, I feel like this one is at least halfway an R + L = J discussion, which has been well-argued in any number of other threads.",asoiaf
" 

I saw a discussion yesterday I believe about why Sansa doesn't deserve the hate she gets, and why her actions are reasonable, smart even. I am not going to address the first bit, whether anyone loves or hates a certain character is naught to me and I don't mean to argue against it.

However, I am going to try and show that Sansa in season 8 is actually, in some regards, less intelligent\\political savvy than her season 5 counterpart, presumably before she has learned all her lessons yet.

The problem with season 8 Sansa actually appears in the very first sentence she utters this season. ""Winterfell is yours, your grace.""  
The delivery of the line has been intentionally cold, and Daenerys is immediately taken aback. Sansa has just met Daenerys and the first thing she does it establishing a rivalry between them. Sansa knows Daenerys is technically now their queen, but she doesn't know her in person, it stands to reason that she knows nothing about her actually, considering how even Jon didn't hear about Tarly's execution yet.

What's more, Sansa is clearly not the one with the power, it is Daenerys with her dragons and armies, in Winterfell. Insulting such a person, that you nothing about, is not particularly smart., if Daenerys somehow proved to have Joffery's streaks, it could even come to bloodshed. On top of that, Daenerys supposedly holds Sansa's prize card - northern independence.

Logically, when dealing such a person for the first time, it is wise to make them your friend. Not only making Daenerys an enemy is dangerous, it also diminishes the chances of her giving Sansa what she wants.

&gt;Always keep your foes confused, if they don't know who you are, or what you want, they don't know what you plan to do next.

If Sansa truly learned anything from Littlefinger, how come she didn't try and make Daenerys a friend first? Littlefinger was everyone's friend, that's why people trusted him and why he was able to manipulate so many people.

When Sansa is given a chance to fix her mistake, when Daenerys comes to her in order to rebuild their relationship, not only she does very little to cooperate, she also outright tells Daenerys she wants northern independence, and she didn't even bother to make Daenerys sympathetic to her desire, all she said was: ""It was taken from us. We took it back and said we will never bow to anyone ever again, what about the north?"" Was Sansa truly expecting Daenerys will simply give up more than 50% of Westeros, after the King in the North bent the knee to her? Not particularly clever.

Now, do we have a scene where Sansa meets another person she doesn't trust, and that she has no power over? Well, we do. Roose Bolton, no less. The man, the legend. The northern who was a major player in the Red Wedding, where her mother died, the northern armies have been slaughtered and where he stabbed her brother in the heart, before taking Winterfell to himself.

"I mean their dragons died out, and we know from Dany's dragons that they were awoken from their stone, dead eggs through fire and a blood sacrifice.

When their main function are basically just sex slaves or a status symbol, why was so much importance put on it? My curiosity grows even more when I look at characters like Dalton Greyjoy who went through quite a few salt wives at a time it just seems impractical. Can you think of any reason why salt wives would be so important as to warrant a ceremony? Where they originally seen as like a backup if their rock wives couldn’t give them heirs and it just grew into a status thing? I’d love to hear other people’s opinions on salt wives and the Ironborn mentality/customs in general and why people think they work the way they do.",asoiaf
"So okay now that game of thrones is over and the dust has settled a bit. I have the question, considering the final season was such a massive diss appointment with man stories and arch’s foreshadowed and set up in previous seasons only to be let down. 

The main that comes to mind for me is Jon’s arch, so much hype about his resurrection, his parentage and his potentially to be Azor ahai, yet he ends up back where he started, 

Bran being setup to be a timetravelling all knowing tree god; he spends the final season starring at people blankly then random becomes king. 

Jaime who looked to have redeemed himself yet to only make a dramatic u turn and be killed by some bricks. 

No explanation about the others, rhllor, mels powers, prince who was promised.  

These are only a few of the ones I was unsatisfied with (I didn’t mention Danny because that could be another paragraph in itself) 

So in winds of winter il assume there will be many differences in the show, considering they split from storylines so long ago the ripple has be significant. And idea I have for one difference would be :

Instead of the night king killing one of Danny’s dragons, he will use the horn of winter to destroy the wall and there might be an ice dragon inside it... well this is only an idea.

Basically my question. Is, if the show has lead to such a disappointing conclusion I can’t imagine George rr Martin will end things this way and in such an unsatisfying manner especially after the backlash of the final season of game of thrones . What other major changes do you think there will be at the end?",asoiaf
"In AGOT Chapter Catelyn VII, Cat discusses the attempt to foster Robin Arryn with Maester Coleman. Coleman brings up that Jon Arryn intended to foster him at Dragonstone, and Cat quickly corrects him that it was supposed to be Casterly Rock. Yet Maester Coleman's ""head jerked so vigorously"" and said ""No, begging your forgiveness my lady but it was Lord Jon who.."" before being cut off by the start of the fight between Bronn and Ser Vardis. 

Earlier in the book they find out the idea of fostering him at Casterly Rock from both King Robert and Lysa, correct? As King Robert suggests it to strengthen the boy and Lysa uses it as a concern of letting Robin go. I'm sort of confused by the significance of this, as did Jon change his mind after he discovered the ""seed is strong"" truth? Were the Lannisters then suspicious when he attempted to foster his son at Dragonstone instead of Casterly Rock slighting them in the process?

I understand Jon was not a friend of the Lannisters and skeptical of them and their power over the King but I'm confused why we didn't know about the Dragonstone idea until this chapter from Maester Coleman and not from Lysa or King Robert.",asoiaf

""Better to have a crew with no tongues who can't read or write""

Perhaps it is because I watched the show first, but I am very surprised as to how fluidly I am getting through these chapters, I very rarely have to go back and reread anything, and I do believe I have identified a few foreshadowing clues already.

I actually believed that I made a mistake buying these books because time and time again in the past I would tell myself that I wanted to try reading but would give up after a few weeks. I don't know, maybe it is because Im getting older (just turned 15).

Not to say I am an expert at analysis and rating books, but I absolutely love GRRM's style of writing, the way he goes into context previous wars and the characters pasts is so well done and makes me want to stay up and keep reading, andt he way he describes the landscapes design and the characters surroundings has really shows the high grade of immersion and world building that George is capable of doing.

"Starts with Jon. Its is a few years after bran is crowned king. Jon has become the king of the true north. He helps the wildling grow and build their tribes. Surprisingly, the seasons still happen and a very light snow falls across the north. 

The kingdom knows peace for a few years under bran’s rule. Then Tyrion dies, and kings landing starts to come undone. Bran is eventually betrayed and killed by someone. But not sure who. Maybe Greyjoy or Dorne since they didn’t have a say in the kings selection. The kingdom descends into chaos. The south is being run by the southern alliance of high garden, Dorne and the iron islands.  Bronn is essentially the general and basically ruler. Storms end is under siege by the Dornish. 

Jon stays out of it but still wants revenge for bran. Sansa and the north rally the banners and head south. Brienne goes to sansa’s side. But the north is defeated, possibly with a surprise betrayal from Edmure tully. Something along the lines of, you’ll never tell me to sit again little niece. Sansa is captured. 

Jon can’t take it. He gathers the wildlings. Including ghost, who never leaves his side. They head south. The remains of the northern army join jon. Saying he is the true king of the north, and saved them from the mad queen that they witnessed burn king landing. This statement hurts Jon. (Can’t change that now, just gotta go with it) He continues south and has several small victories. 

Sansa is being held at kings landing. Kings landing was rebuilt and created much stronger under Tyrion’s guidance while he was hand of the king under bran. Jon, not wanting to destroy and pillage Westeros, heads straight to kings landing to end the war. Jon attacks, but unlike before, Bronn keeps his armies inside the walls. Jon batters his troops against the walls. He is injured and ghost takes a crossbow bolt. The assault fails and they retreat with Jon’s injury. He must take the city, because Edmure Tully is coming to flank him with a hammer and anvil tactic against the wall. 

Jon prepares for a second attack with a depleted army. But as he does, Edmure arrives with his host earlier than expected. Bronn stands on the wall and laughs at Jon. As Edmure’s calvary descends, Jon stands battle of the bastards style ready to die. As the tully horse prepare a lance charge to decimate the north and wildlings, fire erupts through the lines! Drogon has returned! He lands in front of Jon and roars. Bronn shits his pants.

Jon climbs on the back of Drogon, who is even bigger than before. They begin to destroy the Tully army. Edmure is thrown from his horse. Ash and smoke is everywhere. He’s on the ground watching his army be destroyed when he hears something. He slowly turns and sees two burning red eyes come out of the smoke. Ghost rips into him. 

Jon hits the main gate with fire and it begins to burn. Unlike season 8, dragons breath isn’t explosive and the north needs to wait for the gate to burn down. The north flood the city. Tormund searches for Brienne. He finds her and releases her. But they are attacked by Greyjoy’s. Yara attacks Brienne while tormund battles yara’s guards. Brienne slays yara, after tormund takes a blow from yara that would’ve went through Brienne’s guard. Tormund and Brienne kiss. 

Jon finds Bronn looking down at brans wheelchair. He says the cripple could see soo much, but couldnt see me pushing him down the tower stairs. They fight and are pretty equal. As they fight, Bronn starts to be surrounded by Jon’s allies. Drogon, ghost, tormund Brienne watch and Bronn knows he’s doomed. He says something like, “At least I’ll end the Stark and Targaryen lines before I die” and lands a dagger thrust to Jon’s shoulder. It knocks Jon down to a knee. Bronn swings a powerful overhead strike and Jon barely gets his sword up to block. They hit and sparks fly. The sparks hit longclaws blade and it ignites. Flaming super bright, Bronn steps back. Jon rises, and is on the offensive. He has Bronn retreating with a flurry of flaming blows. He sticks longclaw through bronns chest. And the flames engulf bronn’s body. Jon exhausted, collapses backward. Ghost howls and Drogon roars and the screen goes dark. 

The next scene shows the walls of the red keep with banners hanging. They are of a black dragon on a red field and the other side a white dire wolf on a black field. Jon sits with a crown on his head, listening to nobels squabble. Brienne is holding a extra large baby with bright red hair. Ghost is by his side. Jon looks annoyed and bored.  Suddenly he catches a shadow block out the windows light. He goes over to the window. He peers out and sees Drogon soaring through the clouds. As he looks, he swears he sees a woman on his back. Dany? He says quietly. He smiles and rubs ghosts head. Roll credits

"One of the reasons so many character arcs make so little sense in the television series is the way the book characters that were left out of the show were dissected into bits and pieces and then those chunks were given to characters that made it to the series to make sure that certain plot points still took place. Characters do things that originally were actions of other characters, even if that means that the end point of their arcs, which coincides with the end of their storylines in the novels, seems odd to say the least. Cersei inheriting parts of fAegon’s arc, for instance, is much speculated on on this subreddit.

So the question is: if the main plot points concerning the main characters still occur in the novels, whom will Daenerys burn as a traitor? Varys could still meet a fiery end, but Daenerys executing a traitor, or someone she thinks is a traitor, is a rather big plot point. It is also an action, which cannot have been taken from the arc of a “deleted” character. Varys does not serve her in the novels, so who among her councillors is the most likely candidate for ending his (or her) days in dragon fire? It would have to be someone close to her to be impactful. Jon, Tyrion and Greyworm can be ruled out, since they will make it to the end. Missandei is a possible although extremely unlikely option. That leaves Jorah and Barristan, and I am inclined to think the latter is more likely.

Barristan in the series is closer to the novel character than Jorah is. This would mean that the execution would have more impact on Tyrion and Jon. Tyrion, in particular, knows Barristan’s deeds and character very well. He is also a POV character, which means that his views on Daenerys are not only words spoken but also thoughts not shared with any other character. His history as Aerys’s bodyguard would add even more tragic aspects to his character’s end. He travelled far in the hope of finding a monarch worthy of serving, to once more find only fire and blood. There would also be interesting parallels with Jaime, a man he despises so much. Whether he would be an actual traitor or just a victim of Daenerys’s paranoia, the comparison would be unavoidable. Jaime chose to act. Would Barristan choose to act now too to save Westeros from Aerys’s daughter? Or would he face the same end that the people of KL would have suffered had Jaime not acted? And the inhabitants of KL will still burn, no matter what he does or does not do. Will there be people at his execution standing silently and doing nothing, much like there were when Aerys burnt the Starks? 

Do you think that Daenerys will execute someone as a traitor? If so, who do you think is the most likely person to be executed? My apologies if someone has already written about this. Please leave a link in the comments to any such post. Now if you’ll excuse me, my head is covered in tinfoil, and I need to go and unwrap myself.

"The Season 8 battle of winterfell was the most poorly scripted and arranged episode to date, and obviously not for lack of special effects. As I watched virtually all major characters be granted plot armor of inconceivable degrees, it became apparent that D&amp;D had become bored of killing main characters.  


I swear they went meta and decided to instead kill the series. As in kill virtually everything fans were attached to in the series. Semi-realistic battle scenes? Real sense of life and death? Intelligent characters plots and plans undone by other superior plots, chance, or chaos?  


I've only ever seen this to the same degree in video games, where some cut scene constructs some tense mood that you need to complete some level or mission in some amount of time or the entire stronghold or fortress will fall apart. But really you can just run in circles for five hours or spam killing things to level up or hunt for rare ""drops"". The same repeat loop of shaking walls and stones falling keeps playing, but there's really nothing behind it.  


I knew it was bad when the grand scheme of defense was too... leave all their best soldiers outside the walls and ramparts? A blind charge into the night with the dothraki rather than keeping them away for raiding? Only one defense line of ramparts? Not taking as much advantage of the lack of ranged weapons by the dead? Waiting way too long before employing dragons? No boiling oil?  


And why would the Night King risk himself at all? Why even attack so early? Why not raid and raid and raid and build the army and starve the living? All just for bad dramatic effect.   


And the effect on my engagement in the series was palpable. I felt virtually every connection and pleasure that remained with the TV series wane. The validity of the universe collapsed, like the entire army of the dead.   


I was already very well aware of how effort and attention was waning in the post-ADWD episodes, especially when the Reach was conquered in about ten minutes of screen time. HBO should have just taken production and direction from D&amp;D and given it to some other people with a bit more passion.   


But as it is, D&amp;D might as well have put a massive formation of dead bodies in the shape of a middle finger.",asoiaf

This is just something I was reminded of when I watched this Valkyrist video again (really good channel you should check it out). 

I really didn’t like the Manderlys in ADWD, it went against everything we’ve learned about them up till this point, they’re schemers and opportunity seekers just like the Frey’s, and that’s a good thing! In a better timeline they would help Roose and the Freys bring peace to the north and thus they can learn about the real threat. 

The second Robb becomes a king  Wyman try’s grabbing small council positions. Lady hornwood becomes single? He all over it (admittedly like everyone else, but his house is already the best off), and had to be ordered to work with the Umbers to build a fleet. 

Now suddenly they’re playing the “loyal stark men” angle, and it is clearly an angle, they wouldn’t insist on Davos handing them Rickon before pledging to Stannis if it wasn’t, the second he’s back from Skagos, Wyman will be showing him some eligible brides. 

The only reason he’s not committing to the Bolton’s and Frey’s, is because he’s getting no incentive. Ramsay has Winterfell, Hornwood, and maybe the dreadfort. Wyman will probably ending up housing a few Frey’s who have hardly a chance of getting the Twins, and he gets nothing. 

Wyman also shows a huge issue with stark supporters both in and out of universe, he’s a ruthless and vindictive guy, concerned only with his house’s standing, the only difference between Lord too fat, and the Late lord Frey is, one can laugh at the death of a child and cannibalize people and be called a hero, the other is never appreciated for the generosity he shows his family, or given the slightest sympathy when his family is harmed “oh no it’s not your fault Steveron died king Robb, even though you ignored his advice which would have probably prevented it” ""oh it’s fine king Robb, I’m sure you didn’t expect your iron born friend to take Winterfell and my grandsons hostage” “oh ya king Robb you should totally take your army back north to reclaim your lands, while we fight the Tyrells and Lannisters alone”",asoiaf
Both the Casterlys and Lannisters have been using Casterly Rock as a base of power and wealth for **well** over 10 thousand years. Casterly Rock is definitely a massive structure but do we know how deep and expansive it truly is? How much gold would have to be in the mines of Casterly Rock for it to not run dry of gold?,asoiaf
"There are a lot of characters in the books that just seem outright evil, but I think it's pretty obvious George tries to put shades of grey into them all. On top of that we only see some characters from the points of view of those that don't know them. There are plenty of characters who would seem evil if we only took one point of view (Jamie, Tyrion and even Ned). So are there any characters that you feel sorry for with this in mind?

I've always felt pretty bad for the Mountain, sure he has done a lot (Like seriously a lot) of awful things but lots of those things are anecdotal. He was always gunna turn out the way he was, his size and birth meant he'd be a very capable warrior and he presumably would have been led to believe this and proven right. But this poor guy is plagued with headaches that he cannot stop (no wander he killed a man for snoring) and hated by all for being what he was raised to be.

His fight with Oberyn made me feel super sorry for the guy, he is being constantly taunted during the one thing that seems to bring him solace (fighting). Plus he's not the brightest of guys so I wander how much of it all he understands, he's just a big kid really. A big murderous rapey kid.

Any characters you guys feel sorry for that you probably shouldn't?",asoiaf

"Let’s play all this out. Sansa doesn’t deliberately expose Jon’s secret. Ergo Tyrion doesn’t tell Varys. Daenerys doesn’t feel isolated from John. Daenerys still takes King’s Landing, but doesn’t burn the city.

Daenerys rules KL with probably essentially the same small council as we get in the end. Except with Varys and/or Bran as Master of Whispers and somebody competent as Master of Coin. Maybe Jon gets named Master of War instead of Gray Worm, or he gets a seat Just Because.

In any case, Jon likely stays in King’s Landing with Dany, leaving Sansa to rule the North in his stead. Jon would very likely technically be Warden of the North, but Sansa would be ruling Winterfell. Jon probably doesn’t want to be ruling Winterfell anyway.

And ultimately, Jon would wield a huge amount of influence with Daenerys by dint of his claim to the throne. Sure, she could kill him if he tried to exercise it, but she loves him. Short of a dragon, Winterfell would probably get anything imaginable that it asked for.

Now, no, it’s not the same as being a Queen. But it’s still ruling. It’s a compromise that’s better for everybody overall, and compromising your dreams is a part of growing up. Sansa’s daughter would have a good chance of being Queen. Daenerys and Yara would be the precedents for a matriarchal monarchy. They also would have armies who back them personally, not by proxy. Jon legitimately doesn’t want that much power and would defer any attempts by people to defer to him rather than Daenerys.

It’s also a more stable realm. The Iron Islands backed Daenerys and know they’re getting independence. Dorne, Highgarden, and Winterfell all explicitly backed Daenerys. The Vale fought with her against the Dead. The Riverlands are too decimated to do anything but follow the status quo. The Stormlands are stuck with Gendry, but he’s at least a Baratheon who was legitimized by the sitting Queen and can be expected to wield influence. Yeah the Westerlands are probably pissed, but Tyrion probably does what he can as Hand to see that they’re taken care of.

On top of all that, there’d now be an independent army loyal to the crown in the form of the Unsullied and the Dothraki. Not sure how that’s going to go for more than one generation, but presumably they’d train recruits.

And just to take the cake: if and when the Iron Islands is recognized as an independent nation, everybody will know it’s an option and will be “free to ask” for independence as well. Including Sansa. But then, I doubt she could work up the public support for it because... why bother seceding when your guy is already the Queen’s boyfriend or the King?

After all, the North appointed Jon as King, not Sansa. Jon fought with them and worried about the survival of all the living, while Sansa was more worried about having her own personal army. And Sansa was willing to let Stark soldiers die to make sure Jon didn’t wait for the Vale and implicitly subsume it into “his” army. And when Sansa did get her own army, she murdered the guy that delivered it to her (however rotten Littlefinger might be).

Sansa only worries about the North once she feels like Jon is neglecting the North (also her only claim to power). Which he does because he’s worried about the survival of the living. Jon is also 100% correct, as they win by the skin of their teeth. But Sansa intentionally breaks John’s trust to sow discontent among Daenerys’ inner circle, to devastating effect.

So yeah, manipulating the good guys (Jon, Dany, etc) into turning evil and murdering a half million people and each other for personal power is the backstory of a villain, not a heroine. While we can cut Sansa some slack because acquiring power is even more of an uphill battle for her, she also appears to use it primarily at the expense of everyone else.

(As for everyone else: Let’s get real, Cersei and Jaime aren’t gonna get far in a rowboat. Jaime has one hand and Cersei probably doesn’t know how to row. They’re gonna be imprisoned and/or executed. Euron probably still dies or ends up with Jaime and Cersei in the rowboat doing the rowing. The Mountain probably kills the Hound and some Unsullied, then gets killed by Dragonfire. Qyburn probably still gets killed by the Mountain. It’s pretty unlikely any of them are going to drum up enough support to challenge Daenerys).

TL,DR: Sansa set back women’s rights in the rest of Westeros and got half a million people killed so she could be queen *now*, instead of ‘just’ being the operational ruler of the North while laying a superior groundwork for future generations.

EDIT: The North is also in a terrible position as an independent kingdom. It is thoroughly devastated by winter and warfare. Bran is the King, but the extent of his loyalty to Sansa is thoroughly unknown. No one else on the small council has strong ties to it. It’s implicated in razing, raping, and looting of KL and the entire apparatus of government is just *gone*. The Crown is preoccupied with rebuilding itself. It’s very unlikely that the North will get any men or material aid. 

The Iron Islands has ample motive to resent the North and raid it, and the Crown has no obligation to defend the North. Sansa also spurned the leader of the the Riverlands, and the Night’s Watch is headed up by Jon, who she fucked over. Sansa managed to give all her potential trade partners and allies reason to hate her.",asoiaf

"Call me what you will. I know what Isaac supposedly said D&amp;D supposedly said GRRM supposedly said etc. I just don’t buy that Bran might end up as the king of a (nearly) unified Westeros in the books. In order to be the king of a unified Westeros, one has to derive a claim from Aegon the Conqueror or personally make his own unification. These are the rules in the books. Bran does not have a claim that derives from Aegon the Conqueror. Bran does not have the power to conquer Westeros as Aegon did; nor can he achieve his unification with his “wonderful story”. No Lord of Westeros is that stupid in the books. The only king I can see Bran being is the King in the North (albeit for a short time), which is a theory I enlisted to since very early times I read the books.

&gt; Beneath the great grey cliffs a horse was dying noisily, struggling to rise on a broken leg and screaming when he fell. His brother circled round him, then tore out his throat while the horse kicked feebly and rolled his eyes. When he approached the carcass his brother snapped at him and laid back his ears, and he cuffed him with a forepaw and bit his leg. They fought amidst the grass and dirt and falling ashes beside the dead horse, until his brother rolled on his back in submission, tail tucked low. One more bite at his upturned throat; then he fed, and let his brother feed, and licked the blood off his black fur.

&gt; …

&gt; [_Winterfell_] was not dead, just broken. _Like me_, [_Bran_] thought. _I’m not dead either_.

Here we see that after the Sack of Winterfell, Summer and Shaggydog killed a horse and fought over the prey. Summer overpowered Shaggydog and fed on the horse first. Then he let his brother feed while licking his wounds. 

The horse with the broken leg symbolizes the broken Winterfell. The symbolism suggests a conflict between Bran and Rickon, from which Bran will emerge on top. The clues setting up this “Starkbowl” are already provided in the books.

&gt; “Roose Bolton has Lord Eddard’s daughter. To thwart him White Harbor must have Ned’s son … and the direwolf. The wolf will prove the boy is who we say he is, should the Dreadfort attempt to deny him. That is my price, Lord Davos. Smuggle me back my liege lord, and I will take Stannis Baratheon as my king.”

At first glance, you might miss the careful wording here. Lord Wyman was not specific about the particular son of Ned he requested; despite Davos and the readers are led to believe that bringing Rickon back should be enough to satisfy this demand. But as long as Bran lives, he is the liege lord, not Rickon. Unless Davos can retrieve Bran or prove his death, Lord Wyman can always back away from his promise to Stannis even if they give him Rickon. This is not something overlooked or unintended on the part of the writer. GRRM draws our attention to another “deception by wording” in regards to Stannis within the same book and implies that these things were carefully constructed.

&gt; “You have my word, Lord Snow. I will return, with Tormund or without him.” Val glanced at the sky. The moon was but half-full. “Look for me on the first day of the full moon.”

&gt; “I will.” _Do not fail me_, he thought, _or Stannis will have my head_. “Do I have your word that you will keep our princess closely?” the king had said, and Jon had promised that he would. _Val is no princess, though. I told him that half a hundred times._ It was a feeble sort of evasion, a sad rag wrapped around his wounded word. His father would never have approved. _I am the sword that guards the realm of men, Jon reminded himself, and in the end, that must be worth more than one man’s honor._

Jon promised to keep the princess closely but since Val is no true princess, Jon would argue that he should not be held accountable in case Val did not return. It never came to that but if it did, this was the best excuse Jon could think of.

Returning to the Starkbowl, I can see Davos bringing Rickon back (though I am less sure about Shaggydog). Some might even consider Rickon the Lord of Winterfell. But the foreshadowing and the direction of the plot require Bran’s return. What better way to reintroduce Bran to the northern story than playing the loophole in the promise of Lord Wyman?

In the post-Bolton Winterfell, Bran’s whereabouts will surely be discussed before Rickon can be acclaimed as the Lord of Winterfell. For a start, they will know that both Rickon and Bran survived the sack. They will know that the boys went separate ways for safety reasons. The Liddle whom Bran met on the way will tell them that he saw Bran destined to the Wall through mountain paths. But there won’t be any news of Bran’s arrival to the Wall or any sign of him somewhere in the North. That is where their knowledge will end; that is until Sam reveals the truth.

I am more and more convinced that Sam will return to the North in the short term and might even be at Winterfell or the Wall while these discussions are taking place. He will reveal how he let Bran pass beyond the Wall. Therefore, the northern lords gathered at Winterfell will require finding out Bran’s whereabouts beyond the Wall or at least confirming his death before taking Rickon as their liege. 

After that, the story basically writes itself. There will be a ranging beyond the Wall. They will somehow find the cave but for various reasons the magic ward will be broken and the cave will be stormed by the Others. They will have to return through Gorne’s Way (this is where I expect Hodor moment to happen). They will lose a lot of time in the darkness of the caves beneath the ground. During their long absence, they will all be presumed dead and Rickon will be declared the Lord of Winterfell. There might even be a new Lord Commander chosen as I believe Jon will participate in this ranging. But when they emerge from the darkness and return to Winterfell, Bran will reclaim the title from Rickon and eventually be crowned as the King in the North, depending on the fortunes of Stannis in the wars to come.
	
I think this is the only crown Bran will have in the books. For a brief period, he will be Bran the Winter King (compare him to King Edwyn Stark, better known as Edwyn the Spring King). At some point in the story, Bran will leave his seat to his heir Rickon, just like Summer let Shaggydog feed on the horse after he had his way.

&gt; “Those you call the children of the forest have eyes as golden as the sun, but once in a great while one is born amongst them with eyes as red as blood, or green as the moss on a tree in the heart of the forest. By these signs do the gods mark those they have chosen to receive the gift. __The chosen ones are not robust, and their quick years upon the earth are few, for every song must have its balance__.”

A greenseer king can’t have a long reign or a happy ending. Bran should be the Frodo of ASOIAF and retire to a secluded place like the Isle of Faces at the end of the story. Or by GRRM’s own words, we have to admit that the Song of Ice and Fire has no balance.",asoiaf
"try to undermine Bran? They are trying to establish naturalism and rationality over mysticism so how could they have possibly go about undermining an all seeing god? Seems difficult. They must resort to another kind of magic to cloak themselves in order to try and bring bran down, imo. And how will Bran respond the citadel? Will he immediately crack down on the maesters and the rationalist pursuits for which they are famous or will he be more methodical? And how will the people be affected?

Now, I have no doubt whatsoever that Martin's version will be 100x better. On a reread of the series, everything that was good on the show is brilliant in the books, and everything that was mediocre on the show is tense and exciting in the books. Dany's turn to extreme, psychopathic villainy and Bran's lacklustre ascension to the throne were the two most off putting plot points for me, but on a reread I'm convinced that Martin's version will be satisfying in a way the show never was.

It only seems fitting that it end with him too. That and his TER abilities would be put to good use as king, this is assuming the Others are defeated of course.

"Hear me out. The two or so people who were reported to have sailed south had multiple ships, men they already commanded and at least some seafaring experience.

Arya is on board a ship with a crew that can easily mutiny once they are out of reach of Westeros, no seafaring skills, and no back up ships.  The seas are crawling with pirates, or even worse Iron Men whose leader now has no love for the Starks, slavers, and who knows what dangerous beasties.  Looking at the exploration of Earth, she could very well pitch up on an island, be bitten by it's smallest wildlife, and be dead the next week from malaria.  

It would have been better to let the dust settle, be sure of relative peace with at least the Iron Islanders, and travel with more men, ships, maybe a red priestess or someone else with powers, or even ask Davos to come. (For that matter maybe Gendry can come to row any lifeboats).

"&gt;*""If we want the guardians of our city to think it's shameful to be easily provoked into hating one another, we mustn't allow any stories about gods warring, fighting, or plotting against one another... The young cannot distinguish what is allegorical from what isn't, and the opinions they absorb at that age are hard to erase, and apt to become unalterable. For those reasons, we should probably take the utmost care to ensure that the first stories they hear about virtue, are the best ones for them to hear.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*\~ Plato, Republic*

&amp;#x200B;

Despite it's flaws, arguably the most important image of the finale is that of [Aegon Targaryen (Jon Snow) kneeling to Bran the Broken](https://i.redd.it/9wyd3et7px531.jpg). While I'm skeptical that Jon will be named Aegon in the books, this image symbolizes the conceptual core of the ending, which is the old narrative being supplanted by the new.

Though Tyrion's speech about Bran's story seems to come from left field, it's definitely from Martin, because it reflects something the show did not set up, but the books do. Bran's chapters are filled with recollections of Old Nan's stories, and his fixation on them. Of the Long Night, the Night's King, Bran the Builder, the Rat Cook, the Knight of the Laughing Tree, Brave Danny Flint, the Pact, and the Last Hero. These stories not only tend to repeat themselves during asoiaf as an indication of the cyclical nature of human history, they're also the legends which define the Seven Kingdoms.

The Seven Kingdoms as they exists during the story are ruled by the Iron Throne and thus built by the story of Aegon's Conquest. A story of submission through violence, and power achieved through force. Regardless of the exact truth of it, this is the story around which the Seven Kingdoms are unified.

I've often compared Daenerys to Don Quixote, and both characters are in many ways there to explore the positive and negative potential of stories to shape the human soul. For example Dany is essentially poisoned by Viserys' perspective of the world. Like the character of Don Quixote, the stories Daenerys fills her head with inevitably lead her (for good and then ill) to become a liberator, and then a tyrant. Like Quixote, and like Dany, the Seven Kingdoms are also built on stories, many of which set a violent precedent.

The story of Bran the Broken is significant because it sets a new precedent. It's a story of resilience, understanding, and finally choice. Bran's story is not about becoming a great warrior, but a wise shaman. When Tyrion says  *""who has a better story than Bran the Broken?""* it's not about whether his is the best or most interesting story in your opinion (though it is in mine), it's about his being the ideal story to supplant the story of the Iron Throne. The old story was about how the most powerful man in the world forced everyone to submit to his will, yet the new story is about how everyone got together and chose a broken boy.

So is the new story true? Did *everyone* choose Brandon Stark? Wasn't it just a bunch of powerful nobles? Did they choose him for his story? or because they preferred a seemingly weak king after the terror of Daenerys Targaryen?

You see, the story doesn't need to be completely true. And it won't achieve everlasting peace and stability. Similarly, the ancient legends around which the Seven Kingdoms were each built are likely not completely true nor perfect precedents.   The point is aspiring to a better ideal than glory through war. The hope of the ending is that the right story can inspire people to create a better world. Which is actually pretty cool.

Also the music during this scene is actually dope as hell.",asoiaf
"To be honest, I was fully on the anti-D&amp;D bandwagon after the botched seasons 6, 7 &amp; 8. Recently I started reading the books, hoping to get from them what I failed to get from the show, if and whenever TWOW and ADOS are released (Gods...we waited forever for TWOW. Imagine it'll be another 15 years before we ever get ADOS!). But reading AGOT and rewatching Season 1 I have noticed a lot of deviation from the books and NOT in a bad way. So much of D&amp;D's original creations were not just good or acceptable but actually great if not genius. Two of my favourite scenes were not even in the books. The first being the tit for tat between Varys and Littlefinger in front of the Iron Throne. I LOVE the Varys and LF rivalry. But their conversation and animosity is lacking in the first book. Scene 2 is one of my all time favourites of any show. When Tywin skins and dresses the stag before Jaime while giving him a speech on family and their legacy. The introduction of Tywin is that scene is just so well &amp;;/ a shred of that love or admiration from anybody in his life despite being forced to shoulder an entire dynasties legacy from as young as he can remember. There is so much not in the books. These were all great additions either thought up by D&amp;D or at least approved by them in the least. So what went wrong? Clearly we know they are talented or had to have been in order to give us years worth of the show we all grew to love. Did they jusy say fuck it and stop caring once they knew they were making a SW trilogy? What happened between when it was good and when the slump started? Thoughts?",asoiaf
"Just finished reading the first book of the series for the first time and these are the few things I wished they included in the show.


- The Starks’ bound with the Dire wolves. 

- Cersai tries to seduce Ned when he finds out the truth about her kids. ( I have no Idea why they didn’t include this in the show because it shows her character how she’s willing to try/do anything when backed into the corner) 

- Ned’s fever dream about the tower of the joy.

- When Ned’s letter to Stannis it’s found on one of his men. (it made more sense of his treason charges because they had solid proof)


My favorite part of the book is about how Rickon isn’t taking really his parents not being there for him.  

What are some of the things that you wish that they included in the show from the first book? What are your favorite parts from the first book?",asoiaf
"Perhaps this has been discussed before but it’s the first time I’ve noticed it. During my reread, I noticed Ned naming Jon’s mother with ""cool courtesy"". Out of curiosity I searched the term in A Search of Ice and Fire.

The phrase **cool courtesy** is used four times and each time it is used to hide a character’s true feelings or agenda.

The first time is during Ned’s conversation with Robert Baratheon regarding Jon’s mother in AGoT Eddard II:

&gt;“Her name was Wylla,” Ned replied with **cool courtesy**, “and I would sooner not speak of her.”

The second time is in AGoT Bran VI. Robb has called the north’s bannermen for war. Bran reflects that the bannermen all seem to be testing Robb in their own way.

&gt;Robb answered each of them with **cool courtesy**, much as Father might have, and somehow he bent them to his will.

The third time is in ASOS Catelyn IV. Perhaps this example is not as strong because the words “cool” and “courtesy” are not used next to each other and not for the same person. Lothar Frey is described as being the model of courtesy. Later on we discover he is one person responsible for the Red Wedding.

&gt;If Robb seemed **cool** at the table and Edmure surly, Lame Lothar made up for them both. He was the model of **courtesy**, reminiscing warmly about Lord Hoster, offering Catelyn gentle condolences on the loss of Bran and Rickon, praising Edmure for the victory at Stone Mill, and thanking Robb for the “swift sure justice” he had meted out to Rickard Karstark.

The final example is in AFFC Cersei VIII. Cersei brings Margery news of Loras being burned and dying.

&gt;Now you know how I felt, the night my Joffrey died. She bowed, her face a mask of **cool courtesy**. “Sweet daughter, I am so sad for you. I will leave you with your grief.”

All of these characters use cool courtesy to successfully mask their true feelings and further progress their goals except for Cersei. Margery correctly guesses why Cersei is telling her this information - because he’s a vile, cruel and wants power - yet Cersei still uses a mask of cool courtesy. She is unable to hide her agenda and this will lead to her downfall.

I find it interesting as a piece of supporting evidence for R+L = J. Taking into account how the phrase is used elsewhere in the books, the fact that Ned responds with cool courtesy implies he is hiding his true thoughts on the matter i.e. Wylla is not Jon’s mother.",asoiaf
"Often when discussing why Aegon is Faegon people bring up the Golden Company and there loyalty to the Blackfyre pretenders. Though as a I recall during the meeting  between Jon con and the company Harry Strickland says something like ""First is was viserys and 50,000 dothraki screamers, then it was dany in volantis ect ect"" So it seems that the golden company was willing to follow a true targaryen (viserys) before they even knew about young griff. In my opinion the GC is in the dark regarding young griffs true identity pretender or not the GC want to go to westeros.  I don't think the golden company supporting aegon really means anything. The blackfyres are long dead and any loyalty the GC had died with them. I do wish aegon was a blackfyre though as I always loved the storyline and Deamon Blackfyre will always be the true king in my mind",asoiaf
"By this I mean changes that make the show feel more like a show and less like the books

I think Stannis leading the attack on Kings Landing and Jon fighting at the battle for the wall with his sword instead of a bow seem pretty hollywoody, but what else in the show is like this?",asoiaf
"I know everyone was a bit disgruntled that Bran was dubbed ""Bran the Broken"" at the end of the show.

Now, I'm sure someone else has pointed this out before me, but these are the closing lines of Clash of Kings (and one of my favourite parts from any of Bran's chapters):

&gt; *The stone is strong.* Bran told himself, *the roots of the trees go deep, and under the ground the Kings of Winter sit their thrones.* So long as those remained, Winterfell remained. It was not dead, just broken. *Like me,* he thought. *I’m not dead either*.

Honestly I think it'd be kinda poetic if Bran the Broken does come to pass. I... don't dislike it.",asoiaf
"First of all I read a post here saying Sansa has become an unsympathetic character and why she’s destroyed the whole 7 kingdoms.  This is definitely false.

I can go over this a million times, Dany burning King’s landing had nothing to do with Sansa. If Dany can’t trust her best advisors including Tyrion and Varys with the knowledge that Jon has a right to the throne then the problem is that she accepts people who betray her and doesn’t know better. If she thought Jon would never tell anyone just because she asked him not to, then she doesn’t know Jon (Jon might be a Targaryen but at heart is still a Stark, family comes before anything. He represents the new Ned Stark in a lot of ways). 

Sansa is never going to accept an outsider because every suffering she had (the rape, torture, abuse) has been because an outsider (Robert Baratheon) came to Winterfell. Ramsey, Joffrey, Cersei, Littlefinger all were outsiders trying very hard to break her from the moment they met her. 

Now the problem I find with her character is a loss of a good character arc post - season 6. She had minimal screen time especially in S8. Well D&amp;D couldn’t have done worse to her character in any possible way. By making her story less important the Hound’s or Tormund’s (that giant story wasn’t important at all), they actively try to shove B-characters down our throats and instead destroy A-characters like Sansa and Jon (Especially the last season only destroyed almost all A-characters). 

Lastly, there was no reason she would want Dany on the throne. Dany had done nothing this season but show Sansa that she’s got her 2 dragons to do her bidding in everything and btw, 2 of them died very easily. Dany has made poor choices since she left Meereen. Killing the Tarly’s, etc.. 

Sansa is one of the best characters on the show who just didn’t get enough time. She was in no way responsible for Dany going mad and/or deaths of the millions of death in KL. 

People like to call Sansa as Cersei or Littlefinger but I think it’s absolutely false. Cersei or LF were actively trying to make wars for their benefits while Sansa tries to be as passive as possible. She’s more smarter, somewhat like Tywin, trying to burn the bridges when she gets there. 

Bring them downvotes.",asoiaf
Which armies will Bran use to quell rebellions?,asoiaf
"Just stumbled across this passage from the Dorne section: **KINGDOMS OF THE FIRST MEN**. It seems to sum up how Bran's succession is likely to go down in the show.

&amp;#x200B;

'A second, rival High King of Dorne also existed during the times of the First Men, ruling from a great wooden motte-and-bailey castle on the south bank of Greenwood near Lemonwood, where the river flows into the Summer Sea. This was a curious kingship, for whenever a king died, his successor was chosen by election from amongst a dozen noble families that had settled along the river or the eastern shores. The Wades, Shells, Holts, Brooks, Hulls, Lakes, Brownhills, and Briars all threw up kings who ruled from the high hall amongst the lemon trees, but in the end this curious system broke down when a disputed election set the royal houses to warring against one another. After a generation of conflict, three of the old houses were wiped from the earth, and the once-powerful river realm had shattered into a dozen quarrelsome petty kingdoms.'",asoiaf
"&gt; A Dance with Dragons - Daenerys I

&gt; “You have no lack of enemies, Your Grace. You can see their pyramids from your terrace. Zhak, Hazkar, Ghazeen, Merreq, Loraq, all the old slaving families. Pahl. Pahl, most of all. __A house of women now. Bitter old women with a taste for blood. Women do not forget. Women do not forgive.__”

&gt; _No_, Dany thought, _and the Usurper’s dogs will learn that, when I return to Westeros_. It was true that there was blood between her and the House of Pahl. Oznak zo Pahl had been cut down by Strong Belwas in single combat. His father, commander of Meereen’s city watch, had died defending the gates when Joso’s Cock smashed them into splinters. Three uncles had been among the hundred sixty-three on the plaza.

&gt; …

&gt; A Dance with Dragons - Tyrion II

&gt; The magister waggled his fat fingers. “Some contracts are writ in ink, and some in blood. I say no more.”

&gt; The dwarf pondered that. The Golden Company was reputedly the finest of the free companies, founded a century ago by Bittersteel, a bastard son of Aegon the Unworthy. When another of Aegon’s Great Bastards tried to seize the Iron Throne from his trueborn half-brother, Bittersteel joined the revolt. Daemon Blackfyre had perished on the Redgrass Field, however, and his rebellion with him. Those followers of the Black Dragon who survived the battle yet refused to bend the knee fled across the narrow sea, among them Daemon’s younger sons, Bittersteel, and hundreds of landless lords and knights who soon found themselves forced to sell their swords to eat. Some joined the Ragged Standard, some the Second Sons or Maiden’s Men. Bittersteel saw the strength of House Blackfyre scattering to the four winds, so he formed the Golden Company to bind the exiles together.

&gt; From that day to this, the men of the Golden Company had lived and died in the Disputed Lands, fighting for Myr or Lys or Tyrosh in their pointless little wars, and dreaming of the land their fathers had lost. They were exiles and sons of exiles, dispossessed and unforgiven … yet formidable fighters still.

&gt; “I admire your powers of persuasion,” Tyrion told Illyrio. “How did you convince the Golden Company to take up the cause of our sweet queen when they have spent so much of their history fighting _against_ the Targaryens?”

&gt; Illyrio brushed away the objection as if it were a fly. “Black or red, a dragon is still a dragon. __When Maelys the Monstrous died upon the Stepstones, it was the end of the male line of House Blackfyre.__” The cheesemonger smiled through his forked beard. “And Daenerys will give the exiles what Bittersteel and the Blackfyres never could. She will take them home.”

After the death of Maelys the Monstrous, House Blackfyre turned into a house of bitter old women with a taste for blood, just like House Pahl (both in the hands of the Targaryens nonetheless). The children raised by the surviving Blackfyre female leadership (possibly Illyrio and Varys) can only be bitter enemies to Targaryens. This is where Illyrio’s brushing away of Tyrion’s objections falls apart. The Blackfyres did not forget. The Blackfyres did not forgive.",asoiaf
"&gt; ""A pity the Imp is not here with us,"" Lord Renly said. ""I should have won twice as much.""

Currently starting my first re-read of the series and caught this gem reading AGOT. Littlefinger had placed a bet on Jaime during the Hand's Tourney, and Renly had called his bet and backed the Hound. When the Hound won against Jaime, Renly says the above quote.

I just found it hilarious considering Ned was in the audience, and had heard from Cat about how Tyrion won the dagger from Littlefinger by betting against Jaime, something Tyrion insists later he never does. Quite a clever reference from George here that I just thought was amusing and worth sharing.",asoiaf
"Can Theon Greyjoy still experience romantic or sexual attraction? After being tortured and castrated, his entire demeanour and personality (understandably) becomes extremely unassuming, relatively meek, and even a tad subservient even after he escapes and reunites with his sister again. We see Theon and Sansa grow rather close to each other, and both of them clearly have shared trauma and a great deal of affection and love for each other. Sansa seems to adore and appreciate Theon (like the way she shivers and almost cries when asking Theon if he isn’t coming with her in s6) and Theon is very protective of Sansa, so because of this a lot of people “ship” them together in a romantic way. But due to his lack of a sex organ (and so we can assume his sex drive and testosterone has depleted considerably) is he still capable of romantic/sexual feelings for anyone, or is his protectiveness of Sansa purely platonic and brotherly?",asoiaf
"I was disappointed with Bran ending as king because I thought that there is no logic in it - Starks has no claim to the throne. I could imagine that in the books he will be elected by Great Council of which we have many details, especially in F&amp;B or WoIaF. So I thought, what would make lords of the Seven Kingdoms choose crippled boy, even in situation when there are no more viable claimants available and anyone could press his claim. There may be other factor, including his magical status but I think that if yes, they will both compliment each other given how magic is detached in Martin's world. So I started to look for some clues, hints or anything.

&amp;#x200B;

First thing is a conversation between Robert and Ned:

*Robert sat down again. ""Damn you, Ned Stark. You and Jon Arryn, I loved you both. What have you done to me? You were the one should have been king, you or Jon.""*

*""You had the* ***better*** ***claim***, Your Grace.""

&amp;#x200B;

This is obvious and very conspicious, why Ned said that Robert had **better** claim, not something like ""you had a claim"" or ""only you had a right to become a king"". So the way Martin put it implies that both Starks and Arryns or one of the houses had a claim, albeit weaker, to the Iron Throne. Arryn Targaryen marriage are known Rodrick and Daella, Aemma and Viserys I but still I couldn't find if any Targaryen princess married lord Arryn and provided next lord of the Vale. Daella Targaryen was the second wive of Rodrik, he had two sons from his first marriage. In World of Ice and Fire we can read:

*House Arryn can even boast the rare distinction of twice being deemed worthy of marriage with the blood of the dragon. Rodrik Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie, was honored by King Jaehaerys I Targaryen and his wife, the Good Queen Alysanne, with the hand of their daughter, Princess Daella, and a child of that union, the Lady Aemma Arryn, in turn became the first wife of King Viserys I Targaryen and mother to his firstborn child, Princess Rhaenyra, who contended with her half brother Aegon II for the Iron Throne. In that struggle, Jeyne Arryn, Lady of the Eyrie and Maiden of the Vale, proved a staunch friend to Rhaenyra Targaryen and her sons, ultimately serving as one of the regents for King Aegon III.* ***From that day, every Targaryen to sit the Iron Throne had a bit of Arrynblood.***

&amp;#x200B;

So we know that Targaryens have Arryn blood, but if Arryns have Targaryen blood we don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

As for Starks, we don't know it that well, from family tree in World of Ice and Fire we know that there where no marriages in last few generations. But as in the case of Arryns it is not a decisive argument, because both houses still could be related to Targaryens indirectly through marriages with houses which may have a Targaryen blood. It seems unlikely that any other house married to Targaryens. Among Ned's ancestors we have a Lock, Blackwood, Royce, Karstark, Glover. So only Blackwoods and Royce are houses outside of the North. Blackwoods have links with Targaryens as we know. Still it doesn't explain anything and there is no reason to dwell on it as for now.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, there is other conspicious line, by Greatjon:

&amp;#x200B;

*It was the dragons we* ***married***, and the dragons are all dead!""

&amp;#x200B;

This is a very strange phrase to use. It seems to be an euphemis of Torren Stark's bowing to Targaryens and it is, btw, how it was presented in the show:

On the surface it makes more sense so what if Martin phrase is a forshadowing of Starks claim to Iron Throne which will be showed to us only in the end, during final Great Council. If we assume that by that time Daenerys and fAegon will be dead and Jon exiled to the Watch or ""I don't want it"", could Bran have the best claim? What do you think? Are there any other clues out there?

"&gt; A Game of Thrones - Daenerys X

&gt; When the fire died at last and the ground became cool enough to walk upon, Ser Jorah Mormont found her amidst the ashes, surrounded by blackened logs and bits of glowing ember and the burnt bones of __man__ and __woman__ and __stallion__.

While I was skimming through the funeral pyre chapter where the dragons hatched, I noticed something curious. There seems to be three sacrifices that went into the pyre:

1. Drogo

1. Red stallion

1. Mirri Maz Duur

These three were slain in this order. Drogo by Dany’s hands and the other two by Dany’s orders. As a side note, the red stallion was not _the_ red stallion of Drogo because the original one was sacrificed by Mirri Maz Duur previously in order to treat Drogo.

The dragon eggs hatched in somewhat reverse order.

1. Viserion

1. Rhaegal

1. Drogon

In a way, the last sacrifice to die fueled the first dragon egg to hatch and it kept going like that, which means:

1. Mirri Maz Duur gave way to Viserion

1. Red stallion gave way to Rhaegal

1. Drogo gave way to Drogon

This made me wonder about the implications of the sacrifices and the eventual riders of these dragons.

&gt; A Storm of Swords - Daenerys IV

&gt; Drogon and Rhaegal were asleep atop some cushions, curled about each other, but Viserion perched on the edge of her empty bath. “Missandei, what language will these Yunkai’i speak, Valyrian?”

&gt; “Yes, Your Grace,” the child said. “A different dialect than Astapor’s, yet close enough to understand. The slavers name themselves the Wise Masters.”

&gt; “__Wise__?” Dany sat cross-legged on a cushion, and __Viserion__ spread his white-and-gold wings and flapped to her side. “We shall see how wise they are,” she said as she scratched the dragon’s scaly head behind the horns.

As Mirri Maz Duur told Dany in the funeral pyre chapter, maegi means “wise”. When Dany said “wise” in a later chapter, Viserion flapped to Dany’s side and she scratched his head. GRRM does this trick a lot. While something is happening in a scene, pay attention to what the dragons are doing in the background. This does make a lot of sense if a part of the spirit of the “wise woman” still lives in Viserion. It also has ominous foreshadowing that the rider of Viserion should at some point betray Dany, and it might be a controversial, messy, two-sided affair like the betrayal of Mirri Maz Duur.

Though the subject of another thread, it is highly foreshadowed that Tyrion will be the rider of Viserion. No doubt, he will be a “wise” adviser and serve Dany well. But sooner or later, we should expect a betrayal from him to Dany.

I am less certain about the fate of Rhaegal’s rider. The most important thing to remember is that it was not a person but a horse that went into the dragon. And it was a replacement for the original mount of Drogo. This might suggest that the relationship between Dany and the rider of Rhaegal might be business-like instead of being personal; as if Dany will use this dragonrider only as a mount to carry herself forward. This mount-like position of Rhaegal’s rider in the eyes of Dany might eventually lead to betrayal. It is foreshadowed by the [Two Betrayers](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Two_Betrayers) that the two dragonriders of Dany will betray her. The foreshadowing for the betrayal of the dragonriders is even stronger in the main text:

"If always had a fascination with House Bolton because they’ve maintained this unassailable reputation as a “house you don’t fuck with”, nevertheless it seems strange to me that George would write a house that was so irredeemably evil throughout it’s history.

But, for *most* of their history they’ve been, more or less, *loyal* bannermen to the Starks. How is it then that they’ve seemingly always been such a nefarious and sinister house? Why would the Starks have tolerated such an untrustworthy and dangerous vassal for so long?

"Is the citadel in the lannister camp? If anyone knew about the genetics of hair it's them and yet they never raised the alarm. I know Pycelle is a lannister creature however when other high ranking archmaesters noticed this discrepancy in Robert's heirs they should have done something about it. But they did nothing.

Wyman says his maester, Theomore, is a Lannister of Lannisport (I know, I know, they abandon their family names and stuff but blood is thicker...) and is all head and no heart. Wyman knows he cannot rely on Theomore. I'm suspicious about those who would send such a measter to serve him since it seems like they positioned a maester with Lannister blood and a rigid commitment to reason above all else in the household of the wealthiest Northern lord. Almost as if they meant for Theomore to keep his lord loyal to the throne and have him rein Wyman in whenever he got ideas about supporting something like treason. The citadel sent Stannis a measter suited to serve one like Stannis as Cressen notes. However Wyman is sent a maester of Lannister blood who's nature is such that Wyman will not be able to freely rely on him possibly discouraging him from potential treason.

"Sorry if that passage was already given, but I stumbled on that passage while rereading the books.

A Storm of Sword, Arya Chapter, Page 593:

The Brotherhood Without banner is on top of High Heart and Thoros, Lem and Beric are sitting with the Dwarf Witch and she says this:

""I dreamt a wolf howling in the rain, but no one heard his grief,"" the dwarf woman was saying. ""I dreamt such a clangor I thought my head might burst, drums and horns and pipes and screams, but the saddest sound was the *little bells. I dreamt of a maid at a **feast with purple serpents in her hair, venom dripping from their fangs. And later I dreamt that maid again, slaying a savage giant in a castle built of snow"" She turned her head sharply and smiled through the gloom, right at Arya. ""You cannot hide from me, child. Come closer, now""*

And after that the dwarf women panic saying that Arya smell of death.

Now my theory is that the first part, the battle with the sad little bells, could be the burning of Kings Landing (it make sense in my head anyway) and the Maid would be Arya. The venom from her purple hair is used to kill Frey during is feast and the Savage Giant could be the Night King, the castle of snow Being Winterfell.

"Everybody knows Qarth has no chapter in TWOIAF and that Elio and Linda said [in interview](http://www.adriasnews.com/2015/09/elio-linda-interview.html) ""*George would not give us anything about Qarth*"" and somehow compared its level of secrecy to the Summerhall events.

Slaver's Bay was also left out of TWOIAF. However it happened because nobody (even Yandell) cared about Slaver's Bay. In Qarth's case, Yandell makes reference to an in-universe book, the *Jade Compendium,* what's really telling.

We had threads like this before, but I'm here to share my impressions and findings.

**1.** **What might be hidden in Qarth?**

The importance of Summerhall and Meereen are easily perceived. The tragedy of Sumerhall will be Dunk and Egg's final chapter and is a secret in itself. In turn, we have seen that what divides Daenerys' followers and Quenn's false friends in Meereen are historical reasons. So it is reasonable that Martin prefers to leave the historical backstage for TWOW and surprise readers, rather than to put three extra pages in TWOIAF.

Qarth's history, on the other hand, has different implications. Since the city was never part of the Valyrian Freehold, it is quite possible that these two civilizations have already warred. In fact, in ACOK one of Daenerys' bloodriders finds something very relevant south of Vaes Tolorro:

&gt;*Rakharo was the first to return. Due south the red waste stretched on and on, he reported, until it ended on a bleak shore beside the poison water. Between here and there lay only swirling sand, wind-scoured rocks, and plants bristly with sharp thorns.* ***He had passed the bones of a dragon, he swore, so immense that he had ridden his horse through its great black jaws***\*\*\*.\*\*\* *Other than that, he had seen nothing.* ***(ACOK, Daenerys I)***

This striking description resembles that of other formidable animals, well known to readers:

&gt;*The singers had given them the names of gods: Balerion, Meraxes, Vhaghar. Tyrion had stood between their gaping jaws, wordless and awed.* ***You could have ridden a horse down Vhaghar's gullet***\*, although you would not have ridden it out again.\* ***Meraxes was even bigger***\*. And the greatest of them,\* ***Balerion, the Black Dread, could have swallowed an aurochs whole, or even one of the hairy mammoths*** *said to roam the cold wastes beyond the Port of Ibben.* ***(AGOT, Tyrion I)***

Therefore, the bones discovered in the Red Waste show us that the dragon that died there was comparable to the larger Targaryen's dragons. In the light of Martin's refusal to elaborate further on Qarth's history, this discovery becomes more striking, for it seems to indicate that in the past the qaathi (people from whom qartheens are the last living descendants) were able to defeat such dragons.

Another item that connects Valyrians and Quartheens is the horn Dragonbinder. Euron claims to have found the artifact as he walked over Valyria. However, many doubt this claim, and believe Euron stole the horn from the Warlocks he has captured. This hunch is supported by a semi-canonical source (the app, on ""Qarth"" entry).

However, one might wonder how did qartheen warlocks acquire a valyrian dragon horn, which supposedly has the power to subdue and ""bind"" dragons to the will of whoever blows it.

It's hard to picture valyrians giving Qarth artifacts capable of taming dragons, under any pretext soever (eg, wedding gift, offering to Undying Ones or reward for services). Hence, it would have been simpler if someone in Qarth had stolen the horn. And not necessarily from a living person.

While reflecting on Drogon's training, Daenerys recalled that ""*the dragonlords of old Valyria had controlled their mounts with binding spells and sorcerous horns*"" (ADWD, Daenerys X). In that sense, the dragon bones in the Red Waste could be a clue as to how the Warlocks got it. Looting a dragonrider's corpse that Qarth managed to defeat would explain the origin of the horn.

The sorcerous artifact could even explain why Valyria never expanded their hold towards Qarth. With the horn, the warlocks could neutralize dragons. Red Waste and triple walls provided protection against land attacks, while Dragonbinder would protect Qarth from dragon fire.

Lastly: George might still be concerned about sharing information about Qarth because he would have to reveal the secrets of the House of the Undying and it's warlocks, of the Shades of Evening they consume, and of the Black Bark Trees from which the beverage is extracted.

**2. Really?**

No. All these speculations are very coherent, but we can't say any of this for sure.

Indeed, Qarth is not the only place in the known world that has secret organizations with magical profile. TWOIAF has an entire chapter devoted to Braavos without spoiling any secret of the Faceless Men. Another chapter was dedicated to Asshai (where there are also qarthenos wizards in activity) and the city remains as mysterious and unfathomable as ever. King's Landing widely cited and explored, but we gained no new knowledge regarding the Alchemists' Guild.

As for Dragonbinder, even though the aforementioned hypothesis was able to bring together the few elements we have in a coherent way, there is no justification for closing ourselves to other possibilities. Or would it be utterly impossible for Martin to claim that, in the past, a mountless dragon lord fell in disgrace, traveled to Qarth, and sold his precious horn to remake his fortune? That's also a plausible explanation for how it got there.

Nor can it be argued that no valyrian would ever give up the horn because it would allow Qarth to challenge the Freehold, for, see, regardless of how they got it, the Warlocks already have a horn. If this would put them in position to compete with the Freehold, the challenge would have already taken place. And if that would have had already happened, Qarth would have its own dragons. Since none of this happened, we must conclude that the Dragonbinder alone had not enough power to shake Valyria.

On the other hand, the dragon carcass in the middle of the Red Waste hardly prove anything except that it was the site of the last rest of the beast. To think that the creature was ridden by a dragon knight is mere speculation.

Dragon bones have been found from Ibben to Sothoryos. Yandel believes this is evidence that these creatures, though first originated from the Fourteen Flames, ""*must have been spread across much of the known world before they were tamed*"" (TWOIAF, Ancient History: The Rise of Valyria), while others believe that dragons appeared in the ""*Shadow Lands beyond Asshai and the islands of the Jade Sea*"" (AGOT, Daenerys III).

Therefore, the bones in the red desert may be just the remains of a ancient wild dragon.

**3. So what do we really have?**

What we really have on Qarth is the *Jade Compendium,* written by Coloquo Vottar, a volantene.

Votar's work was first mentioned in AFFC and then again in ADWD and TWOIAF. However, the book is not limited to being quoted. He actually appears on the Wall. Sam seeks for a copy in the underground libraries of Castle Black, in order to deliver it to Mae

ster Aemon, who, after examining it with help from Clydas, hands him over to Lord Commander Jon Snow.

What is interesting to note is that the passage in which Aemon and Jon briefly discuss the *Jade Compendium* appears in both AFFC, Samwell I, and ADWD, Jon II. [As some users noted here this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/c2l7tk/spoilers_extended_discarded_how_grrm_rewrote_an/erkw1cp/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), Martin originally only wrote this chapter in Samwell's POV, but some time after 2005 he decided to add Jon's. So it seems Martin thought this conversation needed to be highlighted.

In introducing the Compendium to Jon Snow, Aemon's intention was for the Lord Commander to realize that Stannis's sword did not resemble Azor Ahai's Lightbringer. Jon gets to read the book, but only the few pages indicated by the old maester. This is how Lord Commander summarizes the passage he read:

&gt;*\[...\] ""I looked at that book Maester Aemon left me. The Jade Compendium. The pages that told of Azor Ahai. Lightbringer was his sword. Tempered with his wife's blood if Votar can be believed. Thereafter Lightbringer was never cold to the touch, but warm as Nissa Nissa had been warm. In battle the blade burned fiery hot.* ***Once Azor Ahai fought a monster. When he thrust the sword through the belly of the beast, its blood began to boil. Smoke and steam poured from its mouth, its eyes melted and dribbled down its cheeks, and its body burst into flame.****""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Clydas blinked. ""A sword that makes its own heat …""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*""… would be a fine thing on the Wall."" Jon put aside his wine cup and drew on his black moleskin gloves. ""A pity that the sword that Stannis wields is cold. \[...\]* **(ADWD, Jon III)**

The bold part adds new facts to the version of the legend of Azor Ahai that was told to us in ACOK by Sallador Saan. Thus, it seems that the Compendium has a **more complete** version of the myth. And this version would have been the result of the voyages of a foreigner, Colloquo Votar, by ""*all the lands of the Jade Sea*"" (AFFC, Samwell I; ADWD, Jon II). And among those lands are Yi Ti, Leng and Qarth.

Coincidentally, this is the book whose account of Qarth is, in the opinion of Maester Yandel, **the best source** of information that Westeros has about the city and its surroundings (TWOIAF, Beyond the Sunset Kingdom: Other Lands/ TWOIAF, The Bones and Beyond: Yi Ti). The book is **probably also the most complete source**. Otherwise Yandel would not limit himself to tell the reader to consult the *Compendium*.

Obviously, Yandel's statement was the form found by George Martin to tell us that we will only have access to the Compendium (and information about Qarth) through what the characters tell us. However, in putting things like this, Martin also reveals that the Compendium must contain relevant unpublished information.

**4. But what information has the** ***Jade Compendium*** **given us so far?**

Samwell Tarly refers to the book as ""a thick volume of tales and legends from the East"" (AFFC, Samwell I), and really tales and legends is all we know to be in it. Here is the list of what we have heard:

1. The most complete version we have ever heard of the legend of Azor Ahai and Lightbringer, as seem above (ADWD, Jon III);
2. a curious legend of Yi Ti about a woman with a monkey tail who managed to bring back the sun, after he had hidden his face from the earth for a lifetime, ashamed of something that no one has ever discovered what was (TWOIAF, Ancient History: The Long Night);
3. The best report on Qarth, in Maester Yandel's opinion (TWOIAF, Beyond the Sunset Kingdom: Other Lands);
4. The statement that, beneath every YiTish city, three older cities lie buried (TWOIAF, The Bones and Beyond: Yi Ti);
5. the report that the Empress of Leng, at least four times in the history of the island, put all strangers on the island to death, on orders received from the ""Old Ones"", gods who lived deep below the ruined subterranean cities (TWOIAF, The Bones and Beyond: Leng);

We can observe that, apart from what we have dealt with throughout this post, we only have three new information and they are all about Yi Ti and Leng -- in other words, regions that are of no interest to the main plot.

In addition, of the three information, only one makes an indirect reference to something of interest in the main plot: a legend about Yi Ti's experience during the Long Night, in which a monkey-tail heroine saved the world from catastrophe.

**5. Ok, and?**

And it turns out that this particular legend seems to reverberate in the culture of Yi Ti to this day, just as the legend of Azor Ahai seems to be embedded in the customs of Qarth.

It's not for nothing that the book by which the westerosis have the most complete source of information about Qarth is that which also contains the most complete version of the Azor Ahai's legend.

I explain: Some time ago, [absolutely detail-oriented readers suggested](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/80407-lightbringer-theory-spoilers-if-you-havent-finished-all-the-books/&amp;tab=comments#comment-4072625) that the [qartheens female gowns](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Qartheen_gown), which leave one exposed breast, would be a reference to Nissa Nissa, to whom, according to legend, Azor Ahai would have ordered to ""*bare your breast, and know that I love you best of all that is in this world*"" (ACOK, Davos I) before tempering Lightbringer in her heart.

This already sounded to me like something that fits well with Martin's world-style creation. When, in the light of that, I read about the monkey-tailed heroine, I immediately recalled what Daenerys had observed in the eastern market of Vaes Dothraki:

&gt;""*the bright-eyed men of Yi Ti in monkey-tail hats*"" (AGOT, Daenerys VI)  
&gt;  
&gt;""*a fat cloth trader from Yi Ti was haggling with a Pentoshi over the price of some green dye, the monkey tail on his hat swaying back and forth as he shook his head*"" (AGOT, Daenerys VI)

Therefore, I feel compelled to infer that the influence that the myths of the Long Night exerted on the fashion of Yi Ti and Qarth was created to serve as an example, for comparison.

This case was made to serve as a parameter and enable the reader to decipher the correlations between the events described in the *Jade Compendium* and elements of everyday life of the characters, hidden under the facade of tales and legends of strange, bizarre lands.

That is why I believe that Martin's silence about Qarth serves as an invitation to reflect on the encrypted evidence at our disposal. And, as you can see from the list above, there are at least two more tales from Colloquo Votar's book whose importance remain unknown.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, would anybody be so kind to help me decipher the rest? Thanks in advance.**

"Braxton Beesbury, or Stinger, slept with Princess Saera, but so did Roy Connington and Jonah Mooton. But Mooton only had to marry Perianne Moore as his punishment and Connington was given the option to marry Alys Turnberry and when he refused was able to choose between 10 years of exile or the Night Watch. But Stinger was only given a choice between mutilation or fighting the king in a trial by combat. Why wasn’t he also given the option of marriage, exile, or the Watch? *Fire and Blood* says that he was the most guilty of the three men but how? He didn’t do anything that the others didn’t do and Saera never accuses him of anything specifically. Why was Jaehaerys’s punishment so much greater for him?",asoiaf
"So in the mass effect series, you have this robotic AI race created by an alien race called Quarians, for the first 2 games you're told the robots had risen up and genocided the quarians, but in the third game you learn that it was actually the aliens who attacked the robots first and the robots then attacked in self-defense.

 What if it was actually the humans that were being twats to the Others first and they were just defending themselves? i mean think about the wall, it is said to be 700 feet tall, how in the world did the humans create that? doesnt it make more sense that it was the Others who actually created the wall? Maybe Bran finds out the truth and they make a truce, which makes way more sense to me than the conflict ending in a simple 1v1 war, seeing as GRRM is a pacifist.

"What i mean to say is this people refuse to take some things from the history of Westeros at face value because probably that was Martin's meaning .

Eg lets take the character of Tywin Lannister a guy who has bean discuesed here and in other forums countless of times ,i think some things about him are rather simplier that we (the fans) make them out to be i think Martin wrote him as a ruthless but extremely capable administrator ,great hand of the king and at least capeble battle commenter but not an extraordinary one (Robb who beats Tywin is supposed to be an Alexander the Great type figure) .
Now you have people that judge Tywin and his actions they are real history over analyze them and come to the conclusion actualy he was't that good at anything but i think that actions to be taking at face value and thats what Martin wrote to be nothing more .

I think more characters and situations suffer as much Tywin for us the fans overanalyzing things that meant to be taken at face vallue eg the whole Edmure is not that bright thing.",asoiaf
"I’m doing a book reread and I noticed this passage when Jon is riding with the wildlings in ASOS....

“The giants swayed slowly atop the mammoths as they rode past two by two. Jon’s garron shied, frightened by such strangeness, but whether it was the mammoths or their riders that scared him it was hard to say. Even Ghost backed off a step, baring his teeth in a silent snarl. The direwolf was big, but the mammoths were a deal bigger, and there were many and more of them.”

Why aren’t there more direwolves?  Especially north of the wall. Obviously the Stark direwolves are likely the only ones south of the wall, but we never run into or see them north of the wall. There are regular wolves... and apparently lots of mammoths, according to Jon. It doesn’t seem like they’re extinct or anything. No one north of the wall seems surprised to see Ghost - they’re impressed that he’s Jon’s pet/warg animal (spirit animal?? Not sure of the terminology there)- but they are not surprised he exists. It just seems kinda weird that Jon sees more mammoths than wild direwolves north of the wall.",asoiaf
"**overrated (show version):** arya. she just feels quite one-note despite how beloved she is. she's a tomboy who kills people, with no nuance given to this second point whatsoever. not to be an annoying nerd but the books do a far better job of showing how she's clearly a child going through some severe PTSD-like shit. killing people isn't supposed to be baddass and cool, its traumatic and she's a child who's using it as an extremely unhealthy coping mechanism.

——

In consideration of how George R. R. Martin makes use is foreshadowing or bitter irony (Arya wishing the princess promised to a Frey dead, not knowing she was said princess; Melisandre wishing to see Azor Ahai and is only shown Snow), it had only just occurred to me that Cat’s strangely harsh words should could be the most bitter of them all.

The idea that Bran will be the new king when we’re led to believe time and time again that Jon Snow is one of the forerunners to come out on top at the end, is what we now expect to come at the end of the books. That’s mostly thanks to the show, GRRM telling D&amp;D the basic points, albeit much less nuance likely.

We consider everything that prepares Jon to be this destined hero, this secret princely bastard, born to the path that would make him understand both those who had lots in life less than he but still able to stand and speak with those of higher placing than he. He lives as a royal bastard, he lives as a man of the Night’s Watch among the dregs of society, he lives and understands the free folk, his perceptions are constantly challenged and he grows from them. 

Jon Snow effectively is the Hero’s Journey of A Song Of Ice And Fire. The monomyth if you will. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey

And Bran makes it meaningless on purpose.

We are shown this story time and time again while perhaps it’s truly Bran’s story. Bran gets crippled yes, but in his handicap he is eventually made more powerful, able to potentially supersede everyone else’s destinies. Jon, Dany, fAegon, Cersei, whatever contributions or efforts they will make towards claiming the kingdom whether by force or epic destiny, Bran will blow right past them by virtue of his life being set on a course.

It doesn’t so much matter if he will in the books become a hivemind of the COTF, of Bloodraven or simply be changed by his powers in such a way that he will be the true greatest threat never seen coming. What he will gain in those caves, the powers pretty much unseat any epic destinies, prophecies. None of it matters because his very purpose is cutting across the journey of Jon’s.

I know this is all understood, but like I said... It was there from the beginning. It should have been Jon. 

It simply wasn’t.",asoiaf
"I’ve noticed some similarities between these characters while reading *A Clash of Kings* and wondered if the smart people of this subreddit could tell me what it means.

**Craster**

Craster reminds me of Joffrey and Ramsay. All three are bastards, and get angry when reminded of it.

&gt;”He was never fed,” said Dirk. “Not proper. That bastard Craster starved him dead.” Sam looked around anxiously, but Craster had not returned to the hall. If he had, things might have grown ugly. The wildling hated bastards, though rangers said he was baseborn himself, fathered on a wildling woman by some long-dead crow.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;”Bloody bastard!” Sam heard one of the Garths curse. He never saw which one. “Who calls me bastard?” Craster roared, sweeping platter and meat and wine cups from the table with his left hand while lifting the axe with his right. It’s no more than all men know,” Karl answered.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;But no sooner had that one been dragged away than a knight of solemn mien with a fiery heart on his surcoat shouted out, “Stannis is the true king! A monster sits the Iron Throne, an abomination born of incest!”… Joffrey lurched to his feat. “I’m king! Kill him! Kill him now! I command it.” He chopped down with his hand, a furious, angry gesture…and screeched in pain when his arm brushed against one of the sharp metal fangs that surrounded him. 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;If I had a tail, the Bastard would have cut it off. The thought came unbidden, a vile thought, dangerous. His lordship was not a bastard anymore. Bolton, not Snow. The boy king on the Iron Throne had made Lord Ramsay legitimate, giving him the right to use his lord father’s name. Calling him Snow reminded him of his bastardry and sent him into a black rage.


Like Craster, Joffrey was fathered by a member of an order sworn to take no wife.

&gt;”Dolorous Edd says Craster’s a terrible savage. He marries his daughters and obeys no laws but those he makes himself. **And Dywen told Grenn he’s got black blood in his veins. His mother was a wildling woman who lay with a ranger**, so he’s a bas…” Suddenly he realized what he was about to say. “A bastard.” Jon said with a laugh. “You can say it, Sam. I’ve heard the word before.”

This is a stretch, but both Joffrey and Craster are at times connected to crossbows and rabbits.

&gt;We ate the rabbit, if that’s what you came for.” The admission made him feel absurdly guilty. “Old Lord Crow, him with the talking bird, he gave Craster a crossbow worth a hundred rabbits.” 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;Lord Petyr was seated on his window seat, languid and elegant in a plush plum-colored doublet and a yellow satin cape, one gloved hand resting on his knee. “The king is fighting hares with a crossbow,” he said. “The hares are winning.”

While small, these similarities to Craster reinforced the parallels I noticed between Gilly and two other young women fleeing in the story, Sansa and Jeyne Poole.

**Gilly And Sansa**

Gilly’s situation in *A Clash of Kings* reminds me of Sansa.

Gilly asks for help from a burned man, and so does Sansa.

&gt;Mormont frowned. “A dead man tried to kill me. How well could I be?” He scratched under his chin. His shaggy beard had been singed in the fire, and he’d hacked it off. The pale stubble of his new whiskers made him look old, disreputable, and grumpy. “You do not look well. How is your hand?” “Healing.” Jon flexed his bandaged fingers to show him. He had burned himself more badly than he knew throwing the flaming drapes, and his right hand was swathed in silk halfway to the elbow. At the time he’d falet nothing; the agony had come after. His cracked red skin oozed fluid, and fearsome blood blisters rose between his fingers, big as roaches. The maester says I’ll have scars, but otherwise the hand should be as good as it was before.”
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;The woman knelt on the icy ground. “M’lord, I beg you—“ “Don’t beg me anything. Go back to your hall, you shouldn’t be here. We were commanded not to speak to Craster’s women.” “You don’t have to speak with me, m’lord. Just take me with you, when you go, that’s all I ask.” *All she asks*, he thought. *As if that were nothing*.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;Ser Meryn and Ser Arys followed him out, but Sandor Clegane lingered long enough to yank her roughly to her feet. “Save yourself some pain, girl, and give him what he wants.” “**What…what does he want? Please, tell me**.” “He wants you to smile and smell sweet and be his lady love,” the Hound rasped. “He wants to hear you recite all your pretty little words the way the septa taught you. He wants you to love him…and fear him.”

Gilly asking Jon for help is reversed when Sandor offers to rescue Sansa.

&gt;“I could keep you safe,” he rasped. “They’re all afraid of me. No one would hurt you again, or I’d kill them.” 

Like Sandor, Jon cannot help Gilly. Gilly belongs to Craster, a friend of the Night’s Watch, and Sansa is a captive of Joffrey, who Sandor serves as a member of his Kingsguard. 

&gt;Her fear was plain on her face. “You will come back, though. When your warring’s done, you’ll pass this way again.” “We may.” *If any of us still live*. “**That’s for the Old Bear to say, the one you call Lord Crow. I’m only his squire. I do not choose the road I ride**.”

Both Jon and Sandor deny false titles.

&gt;She wiped her hands on her skirt. “M’lord—“ “I’m no lord.” But others had come crowding around, drawn by the woman’s scream and the crash of the rabbit hutch. “Don’t you believe him, girl,” called out Lark the Sisterman, a ranger mean as a cur. “That’s Lord Snow himself.” “Bastard of Winterfell and brother to kings,” mocked Chett, who’d left his hounds to see what the commotion was about.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;”You rode gallantly today, Ser Sandor,” she made herself say. Sandor Clegane snarled at her. “Spare me your empty compliments, girl…and your ser’s. I am no knight. I spit on them and their vows.”

Both Sansa and Gilly are given cloaks. 

&gt;Crouched atop the rock that had sheltered him during the night was the rabbit keeper, wrapped in a black cloak so large it drowned her. *Sam’s cloak*, Jon realized at once. *Why is she wearing Sam’s cloak?*
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;“The fat one, that Sam, he said to see you. He give me his cloak, so no one would say I didn’t belong.” 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;I wish the Hound were here. The night of the battle, Sandor Clegane had come to her chambers to take her from the city, but Sansa had refused. Sometimes she lay awake at night, wondering if she’d been wise. She had his stained white cloak hidden in a cedar chest beneath her summer silks. She could not say why she’d kept it.

In the chapter where he meets Gilly, Jon also thinks of Sansa. 

&gt;He found himself thinking of his sisters, perhaps because he’d dreamed of them last night.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;“I don’t even know your name.” “Gilly, he called me. For the gillyflower.” “That’s pretty.” He remembered Sansa telling him once that he should say that whenever a lady told him her name. He could not help the girl, but perhaps the courtesy would please her. 

If Jon is Sandor, then Sam is Ser Dontos, who helps Sansa escape the Red Keep.

&gt;The first time he’d seen Craster’s Keep, Gilly had come begging for help, and Sam had lent her his black cloak to conceal her belly when she went to find Jon Snow. *Knights are supposed to defend women and children*.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt; “Sweet lady, I would be your Florian” Dontos said humbly, falling to his knees before her…”Thank you, sweet lady.” Ser Dontos lurched clumsily to his feet, and brushed earth and leaves from his knees. “Your lord father was as true a man as the realm has ever known, but I stood by and let them slay him. I said nothing, did nothing…and yet, when Joffrey would have slain me, you spoke up. Lady, I have never been a hero, no Ryam Redwyne or Barristan the Bold. I’ve won no tourneys, no renown in war…but I was a knight once, and you have helped me remember what that meant. My life is a poor thing, but it is yours.” Ser Dontos placed a hand on the gnarled bole of the heart tree. He was shaking, she saw. “I vow, with your father’s gods as witness, that I shall send you home.”
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;My poor Florian, she thought, as he wiped his mouth with a floppy sleeve. Dress dark, he’d said, yet under his brown hooded cloak he was wearing his old surcoat; red and pink horizontal stripes beneath a black chief bearing three gold crowns, the arms of House Hollard. “Why are you wearing your surcoat? Joff decreed it was death if you were caught dressed as a knight again, he…oh…” Nothing Joff had decreed mattered any longer. “I want to be a knight. For this, at least.”

What is the point of these similarities? Could they show us Sandor’s confused feelings towards Sansa?

&gt;“I told her…” He swallowed. “*What?* That we’d take her with us?” Sam’s fat face blushed a deep red. “On the way home.” He could not meet Jon’s eyes. “She’s going to have a baby.” “Sam, have you taken leave of all your sense? We may not even return this way. And if we do, do you think the Old Bear is going to let you pack off one of Craster’s wives?” “I thought…maybe by then I could think of a way…” “I have no time for this, I have horses to groom and saddle.” Jon walked away as confused as he was angry. Sam’s heart was as big as the rest of him, but for all his reading he could be as thick as Grenn at times. It was impossible, and dishonorable besides. *So why do I feel so ashamed?*

**Gilly And Jeyne Poole**

Gilly’s situation and escape with Sam also reminded me of Jeyne Poole. 

Both happen in the aftermath of a violent meal.

&gt;“So young,” said Wyman Manderly. “Though mayhaps this was a blessing. Had he lived, he would have grown up to be a Frey.” Ser Hosteen slammed his foot into the tabletop, knocking it off its trestles, back into Lord Wyman’s swollen belly. Cups and platters flew, sausages scattered everywhere, and a dozen Manderly men came cursing to their feet. Some grabbed up knives, platters, flagons, anything that might serve as a weapon.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt; “*Who calls me bastard?*” Craster roared, sweeping platter and meat and wine cups from the table with his left hand while lifting the axe with his right. “It’s no more than all men know,” Karl answered. Craster moved quicker than Sam would have believed possible, vaulting across the table with axe in hand. A woman screamed, Garth Greenaway and Orphan Oss drew knives, Karl stumbled back and tripped over Ser Byam lying wounded on the floor. One instant Craster was coming after him spitting curses. The next he was spitting blood. Dirk had grabbed him by the hair, yanked his head back, and opened his throat ear to ear with one long slash. Then he gave him a rough shove, and the wildling fell forward, crashing face first across Ser Byam.

Both Gilly and Jeyne offer to wed if they are rescued. 

&gt;“You don’t have to speak with me, m’lord. Just take me with you, when you go, that’s all I ask.” *All she asks*, he thought. *As if that were nothing*. “I’ll…I’ll be your wife, if you like. My father, he’s got nineteen now, one less won’t hurt him none.” “Black brothers are sworn never to take wives, don’t you know that?
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;Gilly was crying. “Me and the babe. Please. I’ll be your wife, like I was Craster’s.”
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;“Help me.” She clutched at him. “Please. I used to watch you in the yard, playing with your swords. You were so handsome.” She squeezed his arm. “If we ran away, I could be your wife, or your…your whore…whatever you wanted.

Gilly and Jeyne both make the offer to emasculated men: Gilly to the fat, craven Sam and Jeyne to tortured, castrated Theon.

&gt;You said you’d help me,” Gilly reminded him. “I said Jon would help you. Jon’s brave, and he’s a good fighter, but I think he’s dead now. I’m a craven. And fat. Look how fat I am. Besides, Lord Mormont’s hurt. Can’t you see? I couldn’t leave the Lord Commander.” 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;“You could be my man.” Theon wrenched his arm away from her. “I’m no…I’m no one’s man.”

Both of them are saved from their pursuit. Gilly and Sam by Coldhands at Whitetree, and Jeyne and Theon by Crowfood Umber.

Is there any meaning to these similarities? Could the fate of Jeor point to Roose’s future?

&gt;The Lord Commander stood over Craster’s corpse, dark with anger. “The gods will curse us,” he cried. “there is no crime so foul as for a guest to bring murder into a man’s hall. By all the laws of the hearth, we—“ “There are no laws beyond the Wall, old man. Remember?”…”Hold your tongue,” Ollo warned. Instead the Lord Commander grabbed for his dagger. Ollo had only one hand, but that was quick. He twisted free of the old man’s grasp, shoved the knife into Mormont’s belly, and yanked it out again, all red. And then the world went mad.",asoiaf

A Storm of Swords - Bran IV:

&gt;

&gt; As the sun began to set the shadows of the towers lengthened and the wind blew harder, sending gusts of dry dead leaves rattling through the yards. The gathering gloom put Bran in mind of another of Old Nan's stories, the tale of Night's King. He had been the thirteenth man to lead the Night's Watch, she said; a warrior who knew no fear. ""And that was the fault in him,"" she would add, ""for all men must know fear."" **A woman was his downfall; a woman glimpsed from atop the Wall, with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars.** Fearing nothing, he chased her and caught her and loved her, though her skin was cold as ice, and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well.

&gt;**He brought her back to the Nightfort and proclaimed her a queen and himself her king, and with strange sorceries he bound his Sworn Brothers to his will.** For thirteen years they had ruled, Night's King and his corpse queen, till finally the Stark of Winterfell and Joramun of the wildlings had joined to free the Watch from bondage. After his fall, when it was found he had been sacrificing to the Others, all records of Night's King had been destroyed, his very name forbidden.

Since George himself requested the alternate coloring for the miniature there must be some connection to Mel and The Others, especially when you consider the tale of the Night's King from Bran IV.

"Hey everyone, first time posting.

I've thought about it a bit after playing the red dead games and finishing Game of Thrones and I feel like they share a number of character traits that'd be fun to compare.

-Both have an idealistic vision of how the world should be free of tyranny (savage utopia free from the US government vs breaking the wheel of oppression).

-Both are presented to be fairly altruistic with Dany freeing slaves and Dutch being a Robin Hood figure. 

-Their descent into 'madness' is largely due to the death of somebody who acted as their counterbalance (Hosea and Jorah) aswell as the uncertain loyalty of those who follow them (Arthur and Jon being a better alternative as a leader also plays a role).

-It's not clear whether they went mad or just showed their true colours in the end.

-When All of the above happens, their ideals fail, and start to realise those around them no longer love them, they start needlessly killing innocent people in the guise of a 'sacrifice' and 'necessity' because they can't handle losing. In the end, they revelled in being the saviour but not necessarily the act of saving people, when people rejected them their facade falls apart.

-They both end up being killed by Jo(h)n, someone who loved them but ultimately had no choice if they wanted to keep their family safe.

Overall I think both characters represent the end of an old era. Dany is the last of the bloodline monarchy and Dutch is the last of the Western outlaws.

The Dothraki put on rich fabrics and perfumes instead of wearing their traditional clothing when visiting the free cities in order to integrate.  
So when the Dothraki sail to Westeros with Dany, maybe they will put on some Westerosi clothing and perfume to integrate into Westerosi society. This would help make Dany look less of a foreign invader.

But all that aside, I noticed that when Ned exits the room, Varys suddenly appears, he was not part of the scene inside the room. Ned is as surprised as I am to see Varys there.

"Hi all,

I'm trying to understand how addiction (and specifically alcoholism) is tackled in ASOIAF.

Notable alcoholics include Cersei and Tyrion. Both of them seem to be portrayed as (mostly) high functioning alcoholics (in show for sure, and in books too mostly). Tyrion has some episodes where he goes too far but other than that he's still able to function.

Does the ASOIAF content tackle alcoholism showing its more destructive side? What are some examples of this?

Thank you for any replies.

Edit: by far the most mind blowing reveal on this thread was Cersei's weight gain (partly due to alcohol) being set up during AFFC. Fuck me, George, that's beautiful. Makes her walk of shame be all the more traumatizing cos it violently realigns her self image. Fuck!",asoiaf
"I just read Jon’s death in ADWD, but my question is about his motivation to go back to Winterfell. Obviously he’s doing exactly what Ramsay wants him to do, and Jon thinks that he has Arya, but it still feels out of character. He read the pink letter one moment and then in the next decides he’s going to Winterfell (well he talked with Tormund and some other allies for two hours, but we don’t know what they said). Throughout ADWD and his time as Lord Commander Jon deliberated decisions carefully for the most part, and we read his internal struggle when making decisions. That and all his discussions about duty to the Night’s Watch and taking no part in conflicts within the realm.

This time we read no internal struggle, and maybe that’s because GRRM wanted to wrap up the book as quickly as possible at that point, or he’s planning to save that for the next book or whenever Jon gets resurrected. But I’ve also read that because Jon will have spent time in Ghost, he will return more wolf-like, including becoming more bloodthirsty, will want to seek vengeance, and perhaps becomes more rash in his decision-making. Then maybe it’s justified and George will skip the decision-making part. But Jon’s decision to go to Winterfell felt rushed and out of character at this point in the book.

Thoughts?",asoiaf
"Before I interacted with the fandom in any capacity, I had never ever thought about Jon Snow having a ""real"" Targaryen name. I had always assumed he would be Jon Targaryen or Jon Snow still, if Rhaegar and Lyanna had never officially married.

When Rhaegar left Lyanna, he only knew she was pregnant, not the sex of the child. Being as obsessed with prophecies as he was, he likely was expecting a daughter, a Visenya, the third head of the dragon, and never even considered having another son, leaving no instructions for Lyanna on how to name him.

Lyanna was dying. It is likely she never got to name her son or never got to tell Ned the name. Even if she did, at this point Rhaegar, Aerys, Elia, Rhaenys, Aegon were all killed. The Targaryens were crushed. Why would she give her son a Targaryen name, knowing it would put him in danger and Ned would have to rename him anyway?

In conclusion, realistically, it is likely neither Rhaegar nor Lyanna had the chance to name Jon.

If he absolutely must have a Targaryen name for thematic reasons... In my book, Aegon is the hated option, Jaehaerys is the neutral option, Aemon is the preferred option.",asoiaf
"I've been doing a re-read of Arya's chapters and I forgot how endearing Hot Pie really is! He's like, sort of craven but he tries to do the right thing because Arya is there. And I feel like he helps remind us that they're just little kids caught up in a war. So I'd like to just highlight some of my favorite Hot Pie moments.

ARYA III, ACOK:

&gt;“I’m scared,” Hot Pie murmured when he saw the one-armed woman thrashing in the wagon.  
&gt;
&gt;“Me too,” Arya confessed.  
&gt;
&gt;He squeezed her shoulder. “I never truly kicked no boy to death, Arry. I just sold my mommy’s pies, is all.”

ARYA VII, ACOK:

&gt;Hot Pie ate even better; he was where he belonged, in the kitchens... Once he tried to slip her a hot apple tart, but he made such a clumsy job of it that two of the cooks saw. They took the tart away and beat him with a big wooden spoon.

ARYA II, ASOS:

&gt;Hot Pie piped up eagerly. “We're looking for Riverrun,” he said. “How many days' ride is it, do you know?”
&gt;
&gt;**Arya could have killed him**.

LMFAO

&gt;Hot Pie shifted in his seat. “I know the song about the bear,” he said. “Some of it, anyhow.” ... \[He\] joined in lustily, even bouncing in his saddle a little on the rhymes. Arya stared at him in astonishment. He had a good voice and sang well. *He never did anything well, except bake*, she thought to herself.

and

&gt;“Do I look like some bloody baker? I'd like to see you make better.”
&gt;
&gt;“I could,” said Hot Pie. “It's easy. You kneaded the dough too much, that's why it's so hard to chew.” He took another sip of ale, and began talking lovingly of breads and pies and tarts, all the things he loved. Arya rolled her eyes.

ARYA III, ASOS:

&gt;“I’m sorry I beat you that time,” she said. Hot Pie was stupid and craven, but he’d been with her all the way from King’s Landing and she’d gotten used to him. “I broke your nose.”  
&gt;
&gt;“You broke Lem’s too.” Hot Pie grinned. “That was good.”  
&gt;
&gt;“Lem didn’t think so,” Arya said glumly. Then it was time to go. When Hot Pie asked if he might kiss milady’s hand, she punched his shoulder. “Don’t call me that. You’re Hot Pie, and I’m Arry.”  
&gt;
&gt;“I’m not Hot Pie here. Sharna just calls me Boy. The same as she calls the other boy. It’s going to be confusing.”

ANYWAY yeah Hot Pie is the one true king yadda yadda.",asoiaf
"Executing Sansa, Arya, and eventually Jon in the show had Jon chosen Fire&amp;Blood as his path in life? Tyrion and Arya seemed pretty sure Dany was going to kill him down the line because of his claim and Sansa because she would never bend the knee to her. Before he betrayed her, she obviously was still in love with him and wanted him to build the new world together with her as a couple, so I'm not sure if she was going to do either of these things. If she executed his siblings he obviously wouldn't have stood for that and she had to have known this.",asoiaf
"I see a lot of people were complaining that Jon was sent to the wall to placate the Unsullied who were leaving Westeros anyway. Yes, he could just come back as soon as they left, but that would lead to issues. The whole point of the ending is that they are going to pick their kings. Jon, as the last living Targaryen, is a direct threat to that. Even if he didn't want it, any child he had would be known as the grandson of Rhaegar Targaryen. That's why he must own no lands, father no children, etc.

The show didn't really address that, but I'm sure it's going to be a point in the books. He's meant to parallel Aemon Targaryen, who gave up his chance at the throne so he wouldn't be a threat to his brother.",asoiaf
"&gt;A mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone.

Back in 2013, psychologists at The New School in New York City conducted an experiment to see how reading different types of literature affect the reader's ability to empathize with others. To clarify, empathy is the ability to identify and understand the thoughts or feelings of others, not to be confused with sympathy, which is caring about them. Their results were that [reading literary fiction greatly improved empathy](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/novel-finding-reading-literary-fiction-improves-empathy/), while genre fiction did not. Bold claims based on psychology experiments should be met with a huge dose of skepticism, but the mechanism theorized behind this effect makes a lot of sense -- and that mechanism shows how the Song of Ice and Fire series looks much more like literary fiction than genre fiction.

The theory behind the increased empathy is that in literary fiction you spend a lot of time in the head of characters, getting to experience their thoughts. This happens intermittently in third-person omniscient texts, but in first-person narratives you're in the character's head the entire time. Spending hours on end directly observing someone's thoughts, it's believed, increases our capacity for figuring out what other people are thinking and feeling. Even though the characters are fictional, the practice of reading these kinds of books at least gives the reader experience witnessing ideas and motivations different from their own.

I remember when the article first came out; I was in grad school getting an MFA in creative writing. Our Facebook group lit up with clickbait articles claiming ""reading literary fiction gives you the ability to read minds"" and talk about how *of course* literary fiction is superior to that low-brow genre stuff. I recall only one person in the program regularly writing genre fiction; the most popular genre was misery porn.

Yeah, well, as Sandor Clegane said, ""Keep talking and I'll chicken you next Tuesday."" Or something like that, I forget the exact line. Point being, the literary fiction divide is quite silly.

**ASOIAF as Literary Fantasy**

So what is ""literary"" fiction? Basically, it's a dumb name, that's what. It applies to everything that isn't ""genre"" fiction. So what's genre fiction? Think about how streaming services like Prime and Netflix organize their films. There's action, scifi, superhero, comedy, westerns, war films, etc. Everything that falls into the general ""drama"" category? That's literary fiction. For some reason, folks in graduate lit departments have started to think ""literary"" described the quality of the text. It doesn't.

Truth be told, a lot of genre fiction is rather bad. Probably the vast majority of it is bad. Timothy Zahn's *Heir to the Empire* is the reading equivalent of stubbing your toe every 5 minutes. *Thrawn* was a massive improvement, and Zahn succeeded in writing the world's greatest 450-page Wookiepeedia article. But to be fair, this stuff is hard. Getting a D+ puts you in the top 1% of writers. There's a reason you're reading my commentary and not my original works.

Also, truth be told, a lot of literary fiction is also rather bad. There's nothing about being not-genre that makes writing good.

So, where does this leave A Song of Ice and Fire? I'm going to call it Literary Fantasy. And, I don't mean that to say ""it's really well written fantasy."" It *is* really well written fantasy, but I mean something more specific. It's fiction that is doing *what literary fiction is supposed to do.*

Going back to the empathy study, what the researchers classified as literary fiction were stories which spent a lot of time in the head of the characters, giving the reader direct access to their thoughts and feelings. In that light, it's obvious how A Song of Ice and Fire is exceptionally literary.

I mentioned third person omniscient and first person points of view earlier, but ASOIAF is third person close, sometimes called third person limited. Think of this as the over-the-shoulder camera angle common in many video games. It's written with third person pronouns, but stays very intimately attached to a single character (or in the case of ASOIAF, close to one per chapter). This gives us an amount of interiority on par with first person narratives. It varies from character to character, with some being more introspective than others (AGOT Catelyn has much more internal thoughts than AGOT Sansa, for instance), but in general we're spending a lot of time inside the heads of the characters.

While most literary fiction lets us experience the thoughts and feelings of a single protagonist, ASOIAF goes a step further by giving multiple point of view characters. We spent time learning about the mechanics inside several different people's heads. This makes GRRM's novels arguably more literary than most literary fiction, though it does also take him 700 pages to get in all those different perspectives -- doing more *with more* is the expectation.

**Syd Field's Three Lives**

In his book *Screenplay*, Syd Field describes three different lives everyone lives. We have our public/professional lives, our personal lives, and our private lives. This is who we are to the world, who we are to our friends and family, and who we are to ourselves.

Not every novel necessarily needs to delve into each layer, and certainly not in equal amounts. For instance, in Stephen King's *The Body* (the short-ish story Stand By Me is based on) we get mostly Gordon LaChance's personal life with his friends and parents, and his private life, but there's always an undercurrent of the public life, dealing with characters who are only beginning to really have a public life, and how they deal when the public and private butt heads (especially with Chris Chambers's interactions with the school).

In ASOIAF, we often do get a near-even blend of the three. Characters hold war councils, they speak privately with their family and confidants, and they keep some thoughts to themselves. We regularly get all three layers in a single scene. Bran has some time with Rodrik and Lewin before receiving guests for the Harvest Feast. Tyrion travels with some guards to a brothel before sneaking off to Shae's manse. Theon is on a commercial ship before riding off with Aeron, and then meeting with his father privately. Someone meets with a big group, then meets with someone one-on-one, and all the while there we watch their interior gears turn.

While different stories will necessarily require a different blend of these three lives (hard for four kids in the woods to have much of a public life), when it comes to giving the reader useful experience in building their empathetic muscles, seeing these three worlds goes a long way. It reminds us that when we encounter people in the world, we encounter one facet of a multi-faceted personality.

"For AFFC it was the realization that he had to scrap the 5 year gap and start where ASOS left off. For ADWD it was the Mereneese Knot. How about TWOW? Supposedly GRRM was near finishing in 2015 before undergoing massive rewrites. Was that because he didn’t get as far as he wanted (to still end it in seven books), or did he find a major plot hole, or was he simply just unhappy with with the quality of writing? 

Either way, it seems like he scrapped a lot of what he had and is still (seemingly) having issues writing the book. If the Mereenese Knot took him so long to hack through, I can only imagine how many more “knots” he has to deal with in TWOW with all the POVs converging. 

I can’t wait for the day TWOW is finally out and he explains what took him so long like he did with ADWD.",asoiaf

"I’ve been thinking about this, and this is the most intelligent GOT reddit community so I thought I’d ask y’all. 

I sort of have two conflicting thoughts on the PTWP prophecy and want to see what this sub thinks about it.


A- Melisandre and the red priestesses have shown to frequently be an inaccurate source of information, and fans were foolish to blindly believe a prophecy coming from them. 

Melisandre, of course, thought stannis was the prince that was promised. She was wrong. She thought sacrificing shireen would win stannis the war. She was wrong, he was killed the next day. The red priestess in essos thought dany was the prophesied savior, which clearly is wrong. Melisandre is always talking about the prince that was promised. Is she wrong there also? Is it possible that fans way overestimated a prophecy coming from people proven to be an unreliable source of information? It has been talked about in the books and show by some characters about how you shouldn’t always trust prophecies.


Or


B- (I think I subscribe more to this theory)

Jon is the PTWP. Only the darkness was not the white walkers, as suspected, but actually Daenarys. He prevented her from “liberating” the entire world. She was the darkness that had to be stopped.  Of course, this isn’t what Melisandre thought (as evidenced by her thinking her purpose was fulfilled at the end of 8x03). But Melisandre hasn’t been shown as that reliable a source of info. Maybe she and the other red priestesses have a level of truth in what they are saying (prophecies such as the brown/green/blue eyes as well as Maggie the frog with Cersei, turned out true, so there’s some degree of truth in them apparently). Maybe while she knew the PTWP was real (and even thought it was Jon Snow after stannis died), she didn’t have a full understanding of it. She was able to resurrect Jon Snow, which supports this theory, if Jon was indeed the savior. Beric dondarrian was resurrected several times, and served a purpose as well. We saw him sacrifice himself for Arya. But if you think about it- if not for beric’s sacrifice, Jon Snow would have been certainly killed. If beric hadn’t saved Arya, the undead dragon would have definitely killed Jon. In the episode, moments before Arya kills NK, Jon was in a showdown with the undead dragon and the dragon was moments away from killing Jon. I think Beric’s resurrection was just as much about saving Jon as it was saving Arya. Since him saving Arya was critical for Jon snow’s survival as well.

Also- (I haven’t read the books so this is from Wikipedia)

“The phrase “The prince that was promised” is first mentioned in the second novel, “A clash of kings”: during one of her visions in the house of the undying, Daenarys sees a man and woman- presumed to be her brother rhaeagar and his wife Elia Martell- speaking about a newborn baby that the woman is nursing. The man says that the baby shall be called “Aegon” and that he is “the prince that was promised.”

So that seemingly also supports the idea that Jon is the PTWP.

What do you all think?",asoiaf
"So I started my second read of the books and I got to the point in A Game of Thrones where Ned had the realization about Cersei and Jaime. He confronts Cersei about it stating that he's read the book on the history of the major families of westeros. He had the realization that 'the seed is Strong' is the Baratheon genes. That no matter what, the child of a baratheon would have black hair. Ned also noted in the book that he found two accounts of baratheon-lannister marriages. One of the marriages being a male from the Lannister and a female from the Baratheons and the child being a Lannister name having black hair. Wouldn't there then be a possible branch in the Lannister lineage that they have black hair since the black dominates the blonde? Just something to think about",asoiaf
"So it’s been a few weeks since the show ended. Most posts on here have been about how much we hated the ending but what parts of the show’s ending do you think will be largely copied in the books.

1. Dany burning Kings Landing and becoming a villain. It seems most people accept that this will happen in some fashion in the books as well but we are assuming it will be done much better.

2. Bran being King at the end. Based largely on the Bran’s actor admitting this was GRRM’s plan for Bran we will assume it will also happen in the books but be done much better.

3. Jon killing Dany. This seems more debatable but it makes sense based on what we know of both of them that this will happen in the books. Definitely up for debate.

4. How does the White Walker plot end? This is the main one I haven’t seen talked about. We don’t even know if there is a Night King in the books. We definitely don’t know if killing him will end the White Walker threat. Since D&amp;D seemed to randomly pick Arya to be the hero we don’t really know who will lead the Army of the Living to victory or how it will happen. Did the show change the WW ending or is that how GRRM is also going to end it?

5. Arya the Explorer, Jon the Wilding, Queen of the North, Northern Independence, Unsullied going to Naath, etc. more minor endings but any thoughts on these would be interesting as well.",asoiaf
"At first glance you have a gifted knight, one of the most gifted swordsmen in the realm, who trains against 3 and 4 foes at a time when practicing in the yard and is said to be far better than his brother Loras, who is no slouch either and a member of the Kingsguard to boot.

In addition to that he is very kind to Tyrion at Joffrey’s wedding, telling his wife: “No, my lady,” Ser Garlan said. “My Lord of Lannister was made to do great deeds, not to sing of them. But for his chain and his wildfire, the foe would have been across the river. And if Tyrion’s wildlings had not slain most of Lord Stannis’s scouts, we would never have been able to take him unawares.”

So basically he seems like an awesome dude. A total badass and a gentleman as well. 


But then after becoming obsessed with ASOIAF (me, not Garlan, if Garlan actually existed he would be doing something far more meaningful than composing a meaningless post on Reddit right now) come to find out that a lot of people think he may have been involved in the Tyrell/Littlefinger poisoning scheme and his compliments little more then lies meant to placate Tyrion and I guess help prevent Tyrion from becoming so salty that he leaves the wedding reception and they lose their patsy for the crime. Some have even been bold enough to suggest that Garlan was the one who poisoned Joffrey’s cup. Seeing all of that really annoyed me. I don’t buy it, Garlan wouldn’t do that as far as I’m concerned. I wouldn’t be best friends with a guy like that, and I would definitely be best friends with Garlan if he really existed, for a little bit anyway before he got accepted into a college I had no prayer at getting into and found cooler friends and slowly forgot I existed but still, you get the point.

Anyway, where do you guys stand on Garlan? Overall good guy or are you the purveyors of  tinfoil tuna that think he was up to no good at the purple wedding?

Sorry in advance for all of the nonsense in this post and any typos and shit.",asoiaf
"I've just finished reading Cersei II, which was probably one of my favourite chapters in the series so far. GRRM does a fantastic job at highlighting Cersei's descent into madness and paranoia, and how she thinks she's a master of the game after rebuffiing Mace Tyrell, only for Kevan to run rings around her at dinner at the end of the chapter.

I'm disappointed they didn't include the scene where Kevan refuses to become Hand, especially because of that final line about Tommen - ""'Aye,' he added softly, after a pause, 'and his father too I think.'"" 

Reading AFFC has been a different experience for me because whereas in Books 1-3 I mostly could align the books with a scene in the show, obviously AFFC was where the big variations and omissions started happening. I'm enjoying the read at the moment although I've seen a lot of people say it can be a slog to get through.",asoiaf
"Note: this assumes that the end of the show was more or less the same as George’s intended ending on the major points. (the Others are defeated BEFORE Daenerys conquers KL, Dany burns KL, Jon kills Dany, Jon is exiled, King Bran)

I’ve always hated the “descent into Madness” or “Mad Queen” idea with Dany, (people use this term either as a shorthand for mental illness or just being “evil”) because it seems like such lazy plot development. For one thing, George has already set up Cersei to have a psychotic break, like Aerys (including wildfire), so why go to that well twice? To have a character who goes insane (legitimate mental illness, like Aerys) just because it’s supposedly in their genes is exceedingly lame and not where George is going IMO. (There are many examples that have been cited by people as evidence of Daenerys’ madness/insanity in the books and I’m perfectly happy to argue against them.)

I also despise the careless and ham fisted way the show handled her final “turn”. I think George FULLY intends for Daenerys to burn Kings Landing but the circumstances will be VERY different in the books. George will also not present her as a cartoonish villain with completely disgusting and over the top Nazi imagery.   George has not set up either of these developments (insane Dany/Nazi Dany) in the books. 

What George HAS done with Dany is to set up a character who will be *perceived* as a mad cruel tyrant by the Westerosi characters without actually *being* one. What George is doing with her is playing with the notion that the hero is actually the villain from the other sides’ point of view. Try to imagine how Daenerys would appear to you as a reader if you never got her POV? 

Without having Daenerys’ POV, you would be subject to the same information asymmetry about her as the characters in the story are. In AFFC/ADWD we are introduced to wild calumnies spread about her by her enemies in Slavers bay. As readers we would hear these stories exactly as the characters in the novel do. We would be told that the daughter of the mad king, has sacked “ancient and peaceful cities”, “burned diplomatic envoys”, “crucified noblemen”, “broken peace treaties” and “lays with beasts as well as men.” 

By the time we get to Daenerys’ arrival in Westeros, in either TWOW or ADOS, the reader without Dany’s POV, will see Daenerys just as a Westerosi character will see her. By that time, Daenerys will (in all likelihood) have sacked Yunkai, Volantis ,and Pentos. She will have three monstrous dragons in Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal. She will have a massive army of Dothraki “savages”, “slave soldiers”, sell swords, and foreign religious fanatics. Her Westerosi elements will be Iron Born reavers and the most hated man in Westeros, Tyrion Lannister. Westerosi characters will see Daenerys an apocalyptic villain, the Mad King’s daughter come with an unholy army, to kill them all.

When Daenerys burns Kings Landing, killing their beloved King Aegon in the process(and they will absolutely love him). She will have confirmed for Westeros all of their worst fears about her. Without her POV, she would also appear to the reader as an irredeemable monster. One who’s motives, goals, and drives cannot be understood. She would be just another “Dark Lord” trope. 

By giving us Daenerys’ point of view, and making her such a sympathetic and heroic character. George instead allows us to see her at the end, as a tragic, fallen hero. One who is brought down, not by a fault in her genes or a twist of fate, but by the consequences of choices she made(and how others respond to those choices). 

Most importantly, we will understand *why* she makes the choices she makes and maybe even sympathize with them. I’ve said earlier that burning Kings Landing will take place in a different fashion in George’s version than in the show, and this is what I mean. George has very carefully set up Daenerys to:

1) Be *perceived* as a monster by Westeros, as I have already shown.
2) Embrace “Fire and Blood” and reject peaceful negotiations with her enemies. By the end of ADWD, Dany has decided that the cost of peace with the Slavers is too high. To Daenerys, “the peace”feels like defeat(She’s correct), that the Slavers are not acting in good faith(correct again) and are actively seeking to destroy her once and for all(correct again). Daenerys has made the choice to embrace war and conquest. Embracing “Fire and Blood”, her dragon nature, means that Daenerys must accept civilian deaths as a price worth paying for victory. (a tragically wrong decision) When she forgets Hazzea’s name, (the girl Drogon killed) it is symbolic of her making this decision. 

Now, having Daenerys be *unconcerned* with civilian casualties, in the process of defeating her enemies is well within what George has set up. She can unleash her Dragons against (f)Aegon and kill many tens of thousands of innocents in the process, and this would entirely fit what George has been setting up. However there is a VERY big difference morally between being *unconcerned* with civilian casualties to win a War, and *deliberately* trying to kill as many civilians as possible AFTER you’ve already won. George has not set up Daenerys to behave in this way. This combined with the over the top Nazi/First Order imagery, as seen in the show, created a situation where the Daenerys is not the tragic fallen hero George intends her to be, but is instead a cartoonish monster. The Westerosi characters would therefore be *objectively* correct in seeing her this way, rather than correct from their own point of view.",asoiaf

# The High of Righteous Indignation

**Note**: this turned out longer than expected. TL;DR at the bottom.

Since the end of *Game of Thrones,* I've seen many people complaining about the way Daenerys' ""supposed"" madness comes out of left field. It's been disheartening, these last few years to see such vitriol over fictional characters, and I think you can see many parallels between the toxicity which bubbled to the surface after *The Last Jedi* released and the petition movements and at times hour(s)-long Youtube videos spewing self-entitled petulance because they don't agree with how fictional intellectual property was handled.

Many people have responded to Daenerys' ending in the same way Star Wars fans did to Luke Skywalker's characterization in *The Last Jedi*. But the problem is that, in both cases, however valid people's initial frustration, people are getting almost *addicted* to a sense righteous indignation and reveling in a collective petulance (to think it was once a meme to assume some sort of superiority over those ""uncultured swine"" who get into sports), that some develop an unhealthy obsession. ""Not my Daenerys!"" they cry, as they go into detail about why this or that ""isn't what Daenerys would do."" They've had years to build up these theories and headcanons, that some will never be satisfied. Even content creators among the *ASOIAF* community have done this. I used to really enjoy **Ideas of Ice and Fire**'s Youtube videos and theories, but now he mostly just complains about dumb shit the show did, conflating the watered-down D&amp;D version with Martin's book material. **And** ***this*** **is an issue**.

# The Difference Between D&amp;D and Peter Jackson/Philippa Boyens/Fran Walsh

But I think they are at least half, if not mostly right, when it comes to this whole ""crucifying child-murdering slavers as foreshadowing the moment Daenerys burns a city of innocent civilians. I agree because clearly D&amp;D take the shortest path wherever possible, and from the beginning they've only ever sought to adapt *spectacle*, rather than adapt *substance*. As many like to [cite](http://grantland.com/features/the-return-hbo-game-thrones/):

&gt;*Themes are for eighth-grade book reports.*

D&amp;D seem to have looked at the exhaustive work Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens, and Fran Walsh put into adapting Tolkien's *The Lord of the Rings*, and thought ""easy."" Some things PJ/PB/FW did in order to adapt *LOTR* were **inspired** (their ability to condense characters without sacrificing characterization/theme, their intimate knowledge of the lore, their respect for the substance without being impractically dogmatic, their respect for the discerning fans and attention to details that reward closer inspection, etc), and it seems D&amp;D thought it must be that easy. But if D&amp;D set out thinking they were PJ/PB/FW adapting *The Lord of the Rings*, they wound up closer to Warner Bros adapting *The Hobbit* (I recommend checking out [Lindsay Ellis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTRUQ-RKfUs)' Youtube analysis on that process). And so, ***spectacle***, rather than ***substance***.

It's purely speculation, but the final product seems to imply D&amp;D heard ""...and then Daenerys burns Kings Landing,"" and jumped on it because it ""would subvert expectations."" But the end result lacks any *substance.* No dietary value, no commentary on the nature of power, heroes, messiahs, etc You know, themes Sure, we get a misguided monologue that equates apathy to the violent death of an abusive brother who threatened a child (his own sister) with gang-rape and mutilation, leading inevitably to tyranny and war crimes, but that seems like low-hanging fruit. In the end, it's more about the spectacle than any meditation on the substance, and whatever themes or commentary GRRM may be working toward are lost in the noise.

# Frank Herbert and George RR Martin - Beware False Idols

Finally, I mentioned Ideas of Ice and Fire earlier, and the problems of a fan assuming an unhealthy ownership of material. In one of his recent videos, [he goes on a rant about how Daenerys would never do this or that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d6L3lg7ZRU), and how her ending fails the character. I encourage you to watch it, as it captures the point where I think people plateau on the matter of Daenerys not merely as a character, but as a *discourse*.

It's *not* to imply that it's a slippery slope from torturing child-murdering slavers or burning enemies alive, to murdering thousands of civilians. **It's** ***not*** **that women in power can't be trusted**, even though the audience isn't expected to bat an eye when her male counterparts do the same thing. **That** ***this*** **is largely the takeaway says more about David Benioff and D. B. Weiss than it does GRRM**. D&amp;D needed her to get from A to B, and an excuse simple enough to fit into a 5-8 minute after-the-episode short to explain her irrational behavior and inconsistent decisions to get her there. The ""Mad Queen"" characterization was just low-hanging fruit.

Instead, I'd put my money on **Daenerys being meant to follow in the tradition of Frank Herbert's** ***Dune***, with Daenerys fulfilling the role of Paul Atreides, or Adrien ""Ozymandias"" Veidt from Alan Moore's\*\* ***Watchmen***. A *huge*theme of *Dune*, and something Herbert spoke often about, was a distrust for charismatic leaders and messiah-types as a matter of principle, because it is inherently dangerous to blindly follow *anyone,* regardless their trappings. That includes the beautiful/kind/generous-types, not just the ugly/mean/creepy ones. It's not a warning against some sort of ""tyranny of women,"" seriously people? it's a warning against the tyranny **of surrendering autonomy to a charismatic leader**. I began this post with a quote. Asked about the origins of *Dune*, Frank Herbert [responded](https://www.oreilly.com/tim/herbert/ch01.html):

&gt;*I had this theory that superheroes were disastrous for humans, that even if you postulated an infallible hero, the things this hero set in motion fell eventually into the hands of fallible mortals. What better way to destroy a civilization, society or a race than to set people into the wild oscillations which follow their turning over their judgment and decision-making faculties to a superhero?*

We're meant to decide *for ourselves* those qualities we hope to emulate in a character like Daenerys or Paul, but not surrender our autonomy to those leaders who dominate our waking lives under the assumption they're *anything* like the messiahs and charismatic leaders of the stories we've been conditioned to respond positively to. Someone like Ideas of Ice and Fire is right to cite all the generosity and benevolence demonstrated by Daenerys on her journey, but I personally believe it's a mistake to assume that means she's incapable of incredible cruelty; more dangerously, that she's incapable of justifying the *necessity of that cruelty*. Martin says, via Stannis in *A Clash of Kings*:

&gt;*A good act does not wash out the bad,* ***nor a bad act the good***. *Each should have its own reward.*

Or perhaps, a more appropriate quote would be this line from Syrio in *A Game of Thrones*:

&gt;*Just so. Opening your eyes is all that is needing.* ***The heart lies and the head plays tricks with us, but the eyes see true. Look with your eyes. Hear with your ears***. Taste with your mouth. Smell with your nose. Feel with your skin. ***Then comes the thinking, afterward, and in that way knowing the truth***.

**TL;DR**: **NOTHING I've said is gospel, just my takeaway, one I haven't really seen voiced**. We can agree D&amp;D, appreciating spectacle over substance took too many shortcuts to get Daenerys (or everyone, for that matter) from point A to B. But so many people seem to think it's a *betrayal* of her character without even having read the finished story Martin is building toward. Worse, many seem so caught up in riding the high of righteous indignation and collective outrage, that they'd rather complain about this or that than look at what Martin might be trying to say, as opposed to what people want to see after years of expectation, theory-crafting, and headcanon; this last point illustrates an **unhealthy sense of ownership of a piece of fictional intellectual property that exists outside their control, but to which they seem to** ***think themselves entitled***. But maybe, *just maybe*, if one stops fixating on the interpretation of lesser storytellers and allows themselves to be receptive to what it means that the story goes there at all, we stop with all this tired vitriol and get on with more worthy subjects, beginning with Daenerys.

The obvious one is Cersei poisons Arryn . Any ideas welcomed. Your turn please.,asoiaf
"As repeatedly stated in interviews, one of Martin's inspirations for *A Song of Ice and Fire* is Robert Frost's poem *Fire and Ice:*

&gt;Some say the world will end in fire, 
&gt;
&gt;Some say in ice.
&gt;
&gt;From what I’ve tasted of desire
&gt;
&gt;I hold with those who favor fire.
&gt;
&gt;But if it had to perish twice,
&gt;
&gt;I think I know enough of hate
&gt;
&gt;To say that for destruction ice
&gt;
&gt;Is also great
&gt;
&gt;And would suffice.

The show revealed that - much in the fashion of the Robert Frost's poem - there are two parallel plots unraveling simultaneously within the structure of *A Song of Ice and Fire*: a so-called ""Fire Plot"" (being the plot of Civil War and Dany's Dragons) and ""Ice Plot"" (being the plot involving the Others and other magical elements). Both plots have an equal potential of destroying Westeros. For this reason of the dualistic nature of the Ice and Fire Plots embedded within the story's structure, I think that it is wrong to conflate the Azor Ahai prophecy and the Last Hero prophecy. Azor Ahai relates to the Fire Plot, full-filled by Jon and Dany, and the Last Hero relates to the Ice Plot, which I think Bran full-fills.

Here's the Last Hero story told by Old Nan to Bran himself way back in *AGOT*:

&gt;In that darkness, the Others came for the first time … They were cold things, dead things, that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every creature with hot blood in its veins. They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms, felled heroes and armies by the score, riding pale dead horses, and leading hosts of the slain. **All the swords of men could not stay their advance,** and even maidens and suckling babes, found no pity in them. They hunted the maids through the frozen forests, and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now these were the days before the Andals came, and long before the women fled across the narrow sea from the cities of the Rhoyne, and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the First Men, who had taken those lands from the children of the forest. Yet here and there in the fastness of the woods, the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills, and the faces in the trees kept watch. **So as cold and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the children, in the hopes that their ancient** **magics** **could win back what the armies of men had lost. He set out into the dead lands with a sword, a horse, a dog, and a dozen companions. For years he searched until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities. One by one his friends died, and his horse, and finally even his dog, and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it.** And the Others smelled the hot blood in him and came silent on his trail, stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as hounds –

The Last Hero story sounds alot like Bran's story: he traveled far Beyond the Wall, through the deep snows and harsh winds, sought out the Children of the Forest in their caves, lost his friends Hodor and Jojen, and even his dog Summer. Is it not fitting for Bran to full-fill the Last Hero prophecy that Old Nan told him in the first book? Is it not Martin's style to have a cripple be the Last Hero, subverting readers' expectations that it would be a warrior like Jon or Jamie?

Many asked themselves after the show ended, what's the point of Jon's story if he's not responsible for defeating the Others? Well I think the Azor Ahai is a broad allegory for the structure of Jon's story. Briefly, the prophecy states that Azor Ahai tempered his sword in water first, and then a lion, and both times the sword breaks. Finally he tempers his sword through his lover's heart, Nissa Nissa, and succeeds in forging Lightbringer and ending the darkness. If we interpret this more allegorically, Jon forging Lightbringer refers to forging peace throughout the Seven Kingdoms (a big part of his story after all has been forging peace and alliances between different peoples). Water - being of the same element as Ice - refers to the Others, and the loin refers to the Lannister Regime (and maybe their proxies, the Boltons and Littlefinger). Winning these two wars - first against the Others and then against (in the show at least) Cersei - fail to secure peace for the realm. Only after killing Dany, his Nissa Nissa, (possibly through the heart with Longclaw) will peace be secured throughout the realm (by abolishment of absolute monarchy for a more free government - whatever that may be).

Of course this means that the Azor Ahai prophecy doesn't refer to a hero ending the darkness brought by the Others. It refers to a hero ending the darkness brought by civil war (greatly exacerbated by the use of dragons, which may symbolize the introduction of advanced weaponry in real history). This is a well-done subversion by Martin (regardless how much the show may have messed this up). Readers have assumed that the Azor Ahai prophecy and Last Hero prophecy are one in the same - both relating to the Ice Plot - because Martin skillfully hides the Fire Plot from us until the end.

To conclude, I think it's quite obvious that Dany and Jon full-filled the Azor Ahai prophecy in the show. But, in order for my theory to have any weight, I must address the question: If Bran is the Last Hero why isn't he the one to kill the Night King in the show? I think because the show has always chosen to veer away from the more magical elements of the books, and given the self-imposed time restraints, they went for the predictable destroy-the-mother-ship-and-the-enemy-forces-instantly-disintegrates plot seen over and over again in fantasy and science fiction stories. This is how I think (broadly) it will play out in the books: Jon will muster forces from various kingdoms, including Dany's support, to fight the Others. There will be a Battle for the Dawn, perhaps in Winterfell or on the Trident (personally I like the idea of Stannis dying defending Winterfell and Jon and the Northern forces retreating South into the Civil War going on there). But - as the Last Hero prophecy says ""all the swords of men could not stay their advance"" - it will be ultimately up to Bran (using his new magical powers that the show failed to explain) to defeat the Others.

Anyway, wouldn't you feel better about Bran being King at the end if he was the Last Hero, eh?",asoiaf
"Hello you guys
I'm looking for advice with making an list with an order of characters I should follow to make the most out of reading AFFC

I've watched the tv show and just finished ASOS in the normal way of reading, but im really interested in starting my first ever AFFC reading going through all the chapters of a pov before moving to the next
I've searched the sub for older posts on the subject, but i only found people asking for opinions on the idea and people being very passionate about the orthodox order, but im not asking if i *should*. I know it might confuse, i know some pov characters appear in others, i know the series has that order for a reason and all. I care for spoilers but not that much

It would be kind of you to be vague enough so to avoid spoilers, but explain the reasoning

For exemple, my friend told me the jaime arc is more complex in AFFC than cersei's and much of what might puzzle me in hers can be answered in jaime's, so he advised me to put cersei anywhere before jamie

TL;DR: Gonna read AFFC for the fist time in the ""character by character"" way. Want help to make an optimal reaing order",asoiaf
"And that is -- I cannot die happy without knowing that Jaime Lannister will bald one day.

Both his father and surviving uncle are balding. They say that the propensity to bald comes from your mother's side and what do you know? Jaime is an inbred son of a gun. 

Yeah, sure, Jaime's already shaved his head or whatever, but that was his own choice. Balding naturally is a totally different experience. Imagine Jaime just waking up one day with gold hair on his pillow and going ""Oh lions!"". It's comedic (Lannister) gold!

TL;DR: I wanna see Jaime get old enough to start balding.",asoiaf
"DISCLAMER: This is my unpopular opinion about it so, thanks in advance for being civilized.

&amp;#x200B;

It is undeniable how this show has grown in fans throughout the years, myself included. I have been following the show since season 4 aired. So yeah, I have been watching since George R.R. Martin books were the core of the show and I have experienced the same feelings same as **you**, and most fans of the show. I have hated it, loved it, raged at it, loved it again and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

I rarely do reviews but I have to say, I cannot hold in what I have to say about this show anymore. So here is my opinion on the show. I will be comparing it to other big franchises and why I am still satisfied with the way writers David Benioff and D.B Weiss handled familiar situations to wrap up this excellent show. That being said, let’s dive right in and lets talk about..

&amp;#x200B;

**The obvious downsides I decided to let pass**

&amp;#x200B;

**“Plot armor”.** This is something we have stumbled across several times in movies in general, this is not a new thing. But for some reason, Game of Thrones seems to be taking so much backlash about it, and this is why I think it makes no sense to complain about it.

&amp;#x200B;

*Lord of the Rings has plot armor:* LOTR is my deity when it comes to movie entertainment, so don’t get me wrong, this is a top nodge quality trilogy I will always set as an example on how storytelling should be done. Nevertheless, to mention but some examples. Remember that bit in The Fellowship of the Ring when Aragorn, after speaking with Frodo after being chased down by Boromir, He turns around and there is a surreal amount of Uruk-Hai ready to dismember Aragorn’s body off? Well, somehow he survives! Oh, and he survives an even greater number of orcs at the main gates of Rohan gloriously riding down a bridge on **a horse**. That sounds familiar.. right Jon? I mean, If that is not plot armor, I don’t know how to call it.  Remember when Frodo and Sam where trying to sneak past the lines of orcs in Mordor to get to mount doom? I mean, how realistic is to think that starting a riot will distract their attention when they were technically already spotted (and that is the director’s cut so yeah, it’s Peter Jackson’s vision, same as D&amp;D had their own in GoT)... right Arya?... oh and what about Legolas perfect aiming? Oh yeah, Gandalf surviving Balrog, Frodo surviving in… in general? And don’t get me started on the eagles man (effective problem solvers indeed). And, why not? It is a fantasy world after all, just like Westeros is. Anyways, like I said. LOTR trilogy will always be an example. It’s epic and I love it completely.

&amp;#x200B;

*Star Wars has plot armor:* Star Wars has a background history on being divisive. Fans have complained about creative decisions that both prequels and sequels have made. Nevertheless, there is no denying that it's fanbase is one of the biggest and most influential out there, and despite its flaws, Star Wars is still loved by many, myself included. The reception of the movie that started the new trilogy, The Force Awakens, had a tremendous acclaim from both critics and fans. But it seems to me that everyone chose to overlook the fact that its main character Rey, had a plot armor as thick as a blast door shield. There is no build up whatsoever to explain why Rey was just so OP in literally every aspect of her character. She was unbelievably powerful for no reason. Mandtrick pro, badass pilot, experienced force user and she also successfully defeated a trained young enraged Jedi assassin even when she never held a lightsaber in her life. Sadly, it made the character blend, uninteresting and a bit tedious to me. But nobody seems to care much about it, and I am fine with that. But I mean, I prefer to believe that the Iron Fleet had exceptional aiming skills at moving targets, with the exception of aiming Drogon of course, or watch Whitewalkers wasting an entire castle and see a few main characters surviving it, or Raeghal’s blue fire conveniently being less damaging in some scenes, cuz at least that had some build up… right? Fantasy guys.. you get ‘wut Im’ suyn’?

&amp;#x200B;

**“Writing Issues”.** Jeez guys, If I had a dollar for every time this has been mentioned I’d own Dubai by now, literally. And I get it, Game of Thrones has some writing issues BUT, that doesn't mean it ruined the whole series and here is why..

&amp;#x200B;

*Avangers: Endgame has writing issues:* I know this might be a sacrilege and a complete unpopular opinion but before you start salming about it, I did enjoy the movie a lot, I’ve watched all of the MCU and I liked most of what they offered us in the final installment. I say most of it because it did have some problems with its writing, for example -T I M E  T R A V E L-. I have to admit that they did a great job at being consistent on what that concept involves, but man.. Nebula killing Nebula? c’mon! Some of you will come up with some weird theory or comic related material that I honestly have not read, but if I have to go out of my way and buy a whole bunch of comics to fill a gap that the movie wasn’t capable enough to explain in a logical way on its own.. Sorry but that means that there is a writing problem there. Plus, after all the epic battle scene where literally millions of bad aliens fight against humans and other good aliens. Well, after that horde of supernatural beings hit the Earth and puny **humans** fight them bravely... They survive!...well, most of them tho. And then again .. was there even an aftermath? I mean, if we had that today in NY I'm pretty sure I would notice that a big portion of the Earth is at least 80% gone or in a post cataclysmic state to say the very least. But no probs, we can just let our imagination wonder enough to let go of the questions before we get to Tony’s emotional scene that had me in tears for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

*Star Wars has writing issues:* Game of Thrones whole point was to tell us for 7 seasons that the great power that lies beyond the wall is nothing compared to the South little squabbles for power. So many hours invested in theory making and we finally get to see it.. The Long Night airs. We waited so long to see the great battle of Westeros and turns out to be over in ONE episode. Love it. The reason? Well, why not? I mean, nobody seems to care that the whole point of the Star Wars story was about this “chosen one” and what not, and then, after falling to the dark side he gets redemption by saving his son and pass on his legacy to future generations. Suddenly the prequels “came out of nowhere” just like Arya did, to set this new super Jedi girl as some kind of new chosen one I assume? And left the whole Anakin redemption thing completely obliviated, because his grandson wants to follow his bad example? I mean, that was not the point of Anakin’s story arc, was it? And yet, Kylo turns out to be an appealing character. Even though we know so much about his background, we can still enjoy episode 9 and look forward to it, right?. And yes, I know Game of Thrones S08E03 is just as dark as the Devil’s ass, but there's always that VLC option to fix the video brightness just right. Awesome episode, and not to mention that it has two of the most meaningful and emotional the deaths of the entire series. One of them being one of my all time favorite characters, Theon Greyjoy. What is dead may never die my man.

&amp;#x200B;

**“Character development issues”.** YES! You all have made your point quite clear about Daenerys burning King’s Landing. I personally think D&amp;D were hinting that event for quite a while, so it did shock me, but I was kind of expecting it. Yes! Jamie returning to Cersei, Arya not killing Cersei, Arya sailing west of Westeros, and last but not least…. Bran crowned king of the six kingdoms. Loved it. It was all unexpected and that’s why I loved it. I get why people complain about characters not having enough build up time to end up where they did in the series finale, or it was just simply not earned. BUT if you think about it, it all makes sense, and story arcs fit perfectly well within the plot. I cannot overlook the fact that, yes, It feels a smidge rushed, but I still don’t get why people say that it was all ruined, but they seem to care less about the exact same issue in other movies, for example:

&amp;#x200B;

*Avengers: Endgame has character development issues:* To be honest, I was fairly satisfied with the outcome of **some** main characters. I say **some** because Thor used to be on of my favorite superheroes until Endgame happened. I personally didn't like the fact how Thor coped with his post traumatic depression of not being able to kill Thanos in the prior movie. We are talking about a damn powerful demigod able to take a damn star through the chest here, not that drunk childlike gamer weiner we got in the final installment. But there is so much we can do about writing decisions, right Dany..? Same as Thor, why don’t we all agree to understand why Daenerys decided to wipe an entire city to ashes because she was not able to handle rejection from the people of Westeros and her lover?  She literally lost everything, even the right to rule Westeros. After all, it makes sense to think it was a post traumatic depression after watching her best friend being decapitated in her freaking face. I mean I would snap the hell out of everyone too, well I probably wouldn’t have cooked innocents, but then again, wasn’t there a line about Targeryens’s birth? How the Gods would flip a coin every time a Targeryen is born? What about you mr. Night King? Can we all just get over the fact that the Night King didn’t give a proper fight to anyone? I mean, watching him smile after Drogon roasted the hell out of him it's just badass enough. Anyways, we are talking about freaking aliens coming down to earth and the world being saved by superheroes, dragons burning cities and children killing freaking ice zombie leaders. I mean what are the odds of that happening to Earth in real life right? phew.. good thing we’re talking about movies here. But man, what a great show/movie they are.

&amp;#x200B;

*Star Wars has character development issues:* How much time did Finn needed to become the good guy in TFA ? I mean, he was a trained soldier right? he was a first order stormtrooper, trained to follow orders for evil as they may seem, because he was serving as a soldier for the first order. But well he became his prisoner’s bff after (...) minutes of runtime. Reason? I just remember him saying “Because it is the right thing to do”... Jeez is that a good enough for betraying your side and become some rebel’s bff and escape who knows where and consequently becoming one of the first order’s target? Like I said earlier, If I have to go out of my way to read from a book or a comic something the movie wasn’t capable enough to explain in a logical way, It is because there is a writing problem right there. Finn might have his reasons for doing so and being so abrupt in his decision on defecting the first order, and I understand it and I don’t mind it as well as I don’t mind Rey non existent development on being a super Jedi or Dany’s sudden turn to madness. At least that did have some foreshadowing in prior seasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The pros of acknowledging the flaws** 

&amp;#x200B;

1- **It’s a fantasy show, which is why it’s not 100% realistic.** Game of Thrones achieved many things throughout the years, including being one of the most influential tv shows of history for the sole reason that *we* loved it from the beginning. The first episode got us all hooked and the more we watched the more we got invested in the vast world of Westeros, its plot, its drama, its cleverness, its characters, its unique way to develop the story in a way that we end up rooting even for the villains. And as realistic as it may seem, it is easy to forget that we are watching a fantasy show, and that is saying something about its quality. If that is the case, I don’t think it makes any sense to demand realism from a fantasy show. Why don’t we just embrace the top nodge quality of this show’s storytelling, stunning production and a big budget special effects. I honestly haven’t seen anything like it since LOTR or Blade Runner.

&amp;#x200B;

2- **Game of Thrones ties loose ends perfectly.** To be honest, I haven’t been a fan of tv show in general for two main reasons. 1) They lose track of the premise if the show is gaining popularity and 2) There is always a risk of the show getting cancelled for no reason at all. Game of Thrones promised to end in six seasons apparently. Somehow we ended up having eight seasons, and let me tell you something, I have never seen in my life how a show carefully tied loose ends in the season finale. I cried when after following Theon’s story arc we hear bran sayin “Theon, you are a good man. Thank you.” How is that not a satisfying ending? Jeez man, that always gets me. Or watching Jorah Mormont dying in the arms of the one he loved, the one he believed in. Even after being exiled from her twice. The way Melissandre fulfilled her destiny protecting the living against the dead. The prophecy we learned from her when he promised Arya to meet again in season 2. And Jamie, jeez what an epic ending. Tragic but epic. He always loved Cersei, even Olena Tyrell told him that, before he poisoned her when his army took Highgarden. She clearly stated that Cersei will be the end of him, and that’s what we got in the end. But even so, his redemptive story was finished by Brianne in The White Book with the words “He died protecting his queen”. He betrayed his oath by killing the mad king, but he finally fulfilledd his oath by protecting his queen, which also happens to be the woman he really loved. Man, and Brianne story arc? jeez, why do people even complain!? seriously!  And these are just some side characters. Plus the prophecy of Azor Ahai that everyone is raving about, it did come true in the end. Not as we all thought it was going to play out, but they did wrap that up beautifully and there is a Reddit post explaining it all in detail. Plus Jon’s destiny was to continue his days beyond the wall and Bran knew this, which is why he sent him off to the nonexistent “Night’s Watch” with the sole purpose to let him live his well earned days of peace beyond the wall. Arya sailing down to the unknown? She was never meant to be anything else, she was never “a lady” sort of girl. She also played her part by ending the Long Night and she was trained to do so. And Sansa? She became Queen in the North because she was fit to rule, and she demonstrated it by leading Winterfell to victory in the Battle of the Bastards and protecting it while Jon was away and even protected it from Jon himself and his hasty decisions. In the end guys, the way showrunners tied everything up is just epic and perfect. That is how you do a “bittersweet” ending.

&amp;#x200B;

3- **The freedom for characters to make their own choices.** We scream at them when they get to make bad choices, we solve their problems in our side of the tv, mumbling “don’t, just don’t” from our couches while we tensely watch them getting closer and closer to either their salvation or their doom. We loved to see the realism in their interaction with other characters or how they overcome misfortunes or even their own selves. Their outcomes made them more appealing and even relatable. But as realistic as it may seem, let us not forget that they are what they chose to be, they chose to make mistakes too, same as we all do, they make bad or even dumb decisions that frustrates us because we are the ones who can see everything in a broader scope, with the exception of themselves of course. Yet another reason to find this show amazingly realistic and enjoyable.

&amp;#x200B;

4- **Top quality production.** It will be just stupid to deny all the hard work that was put into this show throughout the years. And we can tell that the quality of production that improved so much in the season finale. We got to see special effects and production work that we can only see in a Hollywood budget. And even then, there is some real crap movies going around. In any case, if you have the opportunity to watch the documentary “The Last Watch” that explains the massive production that this show while filming season 8, you should definitely want to do so. Special effects and CGI were just stunning and not to mention that they actually ***built an entire city*** to film episode 5. They knew the balance between green screen and realistic filming, and that is something I appreciate greatly. After watching the documentary it would be just disrespectful to complain about anything. The direction was appealing and interesting. Battle sequences were stunning and exciting, I was genuinely in the edge of my seat in all of them. I could easily watch just season 8 over and over again.

&amp;#x200B;

5- **Thoroughly appreciate music production.** I am a musician myself, and I know and I understand how music work, and let me tell you, Ramin Djawadi did a surreal work with the show’s music. He carefully crafted a theme for each character. That is something just a handful of artists can do. I can just think of names like John Williams, Hans Zimmer, Howard Shore when I hear Ramin Djawadi’s name. The music was appealing, tense, epic and everything else exactly when it needed to be. I do not have words to describe this season’s soundtrack, other that it will definitely be that unreachable work of art and a source of admiration and inspiration for all my future projects.

&amp;#x200B;

And one more BIG side pro for me, is that this show ***never*** meant to reflect today’s trending in their show. And even if people force themselves to see it, I never did, because it never felt that way. Because man, all studios seem to be required to add some stupid useless trending as part of the movie and make it so damn obvious. If I want to see that, I would just watch the news channel. It has always bothered me and it just sucks that all the big studios are falling in doing the same, specially Disney. And that hurts to say, because they compromise an entire franchise, just to add unnecessary scenes with that content. I am sorry for Star Wars and Marvel fans and other movies that have gone through the same at some point. Which is why I love to immerse myself in a land so different and distant, yet relatable, that is Westeros.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I have read what people say about it and YES! I have read about certain main actors of the show ""disappointed"" with the outcome of the show. I would not even be doing this if I hadn’t. My point in doing this, in comparing movies that you probably haven’t even watched or you don’t like, is to prove that movies in general have flaws. All of them (even the best scored in rotten tomatoes). There are no perfect movies and that's why I think it makes no sense to complain. I hate how fans have become so obnoxiously demanding with creators, just because they don’t agree with their version of a story. And yes, I do not completely agree with some things, like Bran crowned King, or how Jon's lineage became irrelevant all of a sudden, but then again, ***they’re only movies***. And this is why I still love this show and the ending of what it probably is one of the best shows of television history. And that's more than enough for me to proudly add the collectors edition to my shelf alongside the Star Wars saga, The Infinity saga and LOTR trilogy.  It's just a matter of perspective and how you find a way to enjoy yourself with it and this is why I still vouch for this show. And this is why I think that ***Game of Thrones season finale DID NOT suck balls.***",asoiaf
"  Ok sorry if this has been talked about before and a second apology as this post is going to be very rambly.

The most disappointing thing about GoT season 8 for me was the others/white walkers. The fact that they were just “the cold big bad” infuriates me, as so many loose ends were left so. 

This got me thinking about what we know about the others/white walkers and a couple of the anomalies that have stuck in my mind regarding the “battle for the dawn”. The two main ones being the Wall and the Nights King.

So the wall is big, and built out of a really difficult material to produce, especially in ancient times without refrigeration. I know it was supposedly built with magic and giants but even still, a giant wall of ice sounds like it is more likely to have been built by the ice demons than by humans, like why build a wall of ice to stop ice demons? Another anomaly with the wall is that even though giants and children of the forest (cotf) helped build it to protect themselves against the others, there only surviving populations live beyond the wall they built to protect themselves.

Also, the nights king is a pretty strong hint that the humans and others reached an agreement, along with the weird ancient nightfort and its weird ancient door. So, if the others and humans reached an agreement why build the wall?

The pact between the cotf and the first men in my mind was most likely in response to the others, enemies putting aside their differences against a larger threat. However, in the show the others/white walkers are created by the children, so if they are just ice minions of the cotf, why would they fight against their masters?

I think that the pact between the humans and the cotf was not a pact between the humans and cotf, but one between the humans and the others against the children and that the wall was built to defend against the cotf. Despite the children supposedly faring poorly in the war against the first men, they possessed massive supernatural magic, breaking the arm of dorne, and as mentioned, if the show is to be believed, creating the others from humans. Perhaps the others overcame there programming and recovered some of their humanity and helped the first men fight against the cotf. Like are we really meant to believe that the cotf weren’t well equipped for war given their insane magic abilities. The end of this war resulting in the wall being put up to defend against the cotf, the establishment of the Nights king with marriage to the others and the cotf fled to the far north.

This is complete speculation but given how long ago all this happened and how the only accounts of what happened are just stories passed down through generations for thousands of years the story of what happened is probably very different to what actually happened. 

I know this has some issues like cotf living on the isle of faces and that some people believe that cotf live in the neck, along with why do the first men continue to worship the religion of the cotf if they fought a war against them. But I think that these can sort of be botched to make sense. I doubt that all the cotf wanted to war against the first men, so made peace through marriage (the neck and crannogman) and exile(?) by living on the isle of faces. In regard to gods, the old gods were probably very real to those in ancient westeros with the cotf throwing magic all over the place, so perhaps the first men started worshipping them as well to earn their favour or something. 

Idk I think it would be a nice twist if the supposedly good, leafy, environmental elves turned out to be the vengeful dark evil rather than the obvious ice demons.

Also giants, why do the giants only live beyond the wall? I think that its highly possible that the cotf warged into them and used them as weapons, we’ve already seen Bran do this with the “giant” Hodor, and like Hodor, giants aren’t the smartest so were probably easyish to warg into. So when the cotf were pushed north so were the giants. 

One last thing I just thought of, in the first book a few wights, animated by the others, are able to pass through the wall and attack the lord commander, but coldhands, who is animated by the cotf, cant pass through the wall when he goes to meet bran. So if the cotf supposedly put magic into the wall when they built it to protect against the others, why can the others wights pass through it, but coldhands cant?

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: I think its possible that the pact was not between the children and first men but between the others and the first men against the children.**",asoiaf
"From ASOS...
“Gendry rode out from behind the cottage wall, and behind him Hot Pie, leading her horse. In his chainmail shirt with a sword in his hand, Gendry looked almost a man grown, and dangerous. ***Hot Pie looked like Hot Pie.”***",asoiaf
"So I'm sure this has been discussed for years now, but I'm a new reader who just got into the series after season 8 subverted my expectations of a proper ending, so this is all fresh to me. 

Anyway I just reached the chapter in ASOS where Robb and the Blackfish return to Rivverun and get pissed with Edmure for pushing Tywin back. In the show, they painted this as an utter tactical failure by Edmure and make him into an incompetent buffoon pretty much for the rest of the series. But with the expanded explanation of exactly what is going on from ACOK and ASOS, I'm totally team Edmure on this one. Robb literally never tells him his supposedly genius plan to trap Tywin in the Westerlands, merely tells him to stay put and hold Riverrun. This basically means sacrificing all of the smallfolk outside of the city walls, turning Edmure's lands into a burned out wasteland like the rest of the Trident is. 

Edmure saved all of his people and is a hero. Robb fucked up about 1000x worse by marrying Jayne Westerling and has no right to insult Ed like that. Sure Robb, your tactical plan was really smart, but if you don't tell your commanders it was probably doomed from the start. It also makes you a massive douchebag when you call your bannerman out for saving the lives of all his people when he was working with an incomplete picture of how the battle would affect the war as a whole. 

On top of all the injustices done to Edmure by Catelyn, Robb, and Brynden, he still immediately apologizes when he realizes he made a ""mistake"" and offers to do *anything* to make it right. True team player right here, who really just has everyone's best interests at heart. In response to this, he has to fix all of Robb's mistakes in addition to his own. 

Anyway, Edmure deserves better. He is quickly becoming one of my favorite characters simply because he is consistently doing the right thing and everyone consistently underestimates him no matter how much good he does. The only bad part of his characterization is I now have another reason for hating the show. They basically took the biased view of him Catelyn has, and made it his actual character for some reason.",asoiaf
I want to see Tywin's reaction to Aerys rejecting the Cersei offer.,asoiaf
"Of course this is not going to happen, so bear with me, as it's just a thought I had.

Books are very much different than a TV series as a medium, and one of the biggest differences is that the chapters need to be released all at once, and there isn't really much around that. This is probably a good thing for most people, but I really miss all of the hype surrounding cliffhangers and the downtime between each episode where people are viciously discussing online and posting their theories.

So imagine that the next books would be released little by little, say, one or two chapters a week, online or through some other manner. Do you think you would get more or less enjoyment from it, overall?",asoiaf
"When I read the books I read them in published order as most people suggest, and found AFfC and ADwD a bit of a slog. I do think they're incredible books and my opinion of them has only grown more positive since finishing them, seeing the big picture and reading essays about them etc, so I'm looking forward to re-reading them using one of the combined orders.

I understand very few people will have read all three orders listed in the title, but for people who've read two or more of them or simply compared them in detail, I'm wondering what you consider to be the advantages and disadvantages of each. How do they contrast? Which felt more natural in terms of chapter transitions, and in terms of the story progression?

I think ideally I want to find the order that would feel most convincingly like ""one book"" if bound together. Do you prioritise something else in your readthroughs?",asoiaf
"GRRM has said that we will probably not visit Asshai in the main narrative of ASOIAF, except perhaps in POV flashbacks or through character recollections.

But was that always the case? In earlier versions of GRRM's plan, could a POV character have visited Asshai in the present time period as part of the main narrative? (Dany perhaps)

After reading The World of Ice and Fire, I wonder if some of that material (especially concerning the Further East beyond the Bone Mountains) was supposed to be revealed in ASOIAF itself, but there is no longer room for it in the story GRRM is trying to tell. So, as he narrows and tightens the narrative, earlier material might have been preserved and moved into The World of Ice and Fire.

For example:
Dany's visions/dreams in the published A Game of Thrones featured gold/silver haired figures with eye colours that correspond with the legendary Gemstone Emperors of the Great Empire of the Dawn. Implying that the history of that lost ancient civilization would have some bearing on the unfolding story still to come.
Four books later and perhaps that history is no longer as important to reaching the final endgame of the story.

What are your thoughts?",asoiaf
"In a song of ice and fire we learn of the great tourney of Harrenhall. In this tale, the heroic Knight of the Laughing tree enters the list as a mystery knight. This person defeats 3 knights and implores them to chastise their squires in order to restore young Howland Reed's honor.  Lyanna Stark is the prime suspect as to the Knights identity.

In fire and blood a recurring theme is mystery knights. Fire and blood seems to be written as first a companion book to the song of ice and fire series, but also serves the purpose of planting ideas in the readers heads in relation to history repeating itself. 

The one that stands out the most to me is the recurring introduction of strong female mystery knights. These knights impress the Targaryans so much that they honor them all. This foreshadows the tourney at Harrenhall and possibly Lyanna stark impressing Rhegar so much, that he falls in love with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Evidence:

&amp;#x200B;

Jonquil dark enters the tourney of the Golden wedding. She is a fan favorite of the small folk. She leves such an impression on King Jahereys, that he enlists her as the sworn sheild to his sister/Wife Queen Alysanne.

&amp;#x200B;

Later at the tourney in white harbor, the mystery knight unmasked is a Wilding woman. So impressive was she, that the Queen honours her by commanding a dual between her and her newly appointed sworn shield.

"Edit: Davos for helping Storms End during the siege, got his fingers cut but gain a a lordship, lands and his family living from flea bottom turned into Nobles. I can see why his Loyal to him. But what of the other folks around him, like his soldiers?",asoiaf
"legitimized Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. Or maybe just Lord of Storm's End in the books. It makes a lot more sense. While Gendry's mother was a nameless tavern wench, Edric Storm's mother is known to be a noblewoman from an important house (Florent). While Gendry was raised in Flea Bottom, Edric Storm was raised in Storm's End itself. And what's more, the castellan of that castle was prepared to die to protect Edric. So he obviously inspires some degree of loyalty already. I think he's also the only one of Robert's bastards officially recognized by the man himself. 

On the other hand, as people have noted, Gendry's probably going to be beaten up and thrown into a ditch by the high lords of the Stormlands. Some guy they've never heard of, who can't read or write or separate m'lords from my lords, who was legitimized by a dead evil dragon queen marches in and tells them he's in charge. Not a recipe for success.

Of course, the high lords of the Stormlands would be reluctant to accept a bastard of any stripe as their supreme overlord, literate or no. This is why I think Edric Storm might just be lord of Storm's End and control of the Stormlands would be passed to someone else. Still, he would be carrying on the Baratheon name and legacy where previously it might've gone extinct. I think this may have been Martin's intent, but the Showrunner re-arranged it in such a way as to make it more understandable to casual viewers, as they did earlier with these very same characters.",asoiaf

"##Intro

The Meereenese Knot was a major narrative problem dealing with the confluence of several viewpoint characters (Daenerys, Quentyn, Victarion and Tyrion), several major plot elements (Sons of the Harpy insurgency, Yunkish siege, Drogon's return, plague) and how the timing of everything plagued George RR Martin in writing and finishing ADWD.

Here's George talking about it in 2012:

&gt; Questioner: ""Now that we know how the ""Meereenese knot"" played out, what was the problem with this? For example, was it the order in which Dany met various characters, or who, when, and how someone would try to take the dragons?""

&gt; **GRRM**: ""Now I can explain things. It was a confluence of many, many factors: lets start with the offer from Xaro to give Dany ships, the refusal of which then leads to Qarth's declaration of war. Then there's the marriage of Daenerys to pacify the city. Then there's the arrival of the Yunkish army at the gates of Meereen, there's the order of arrival of various people going her way (Tyrion, Quentyn, Victarion, Aegon, Marwyn, etc.), and then there's Daario, this dangerous sellsword and the question of whether Dany really wants him or not, there's the plague, there's Drogon's return to Meereen ... - [So Spake Martin, 7/28/2012](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Asshai.com_Interview_in_Barcelona/)

This is all well-trod ground that I've covered in a few previous analyses ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2pp2m8/spoilers_all_an_analysis_exploration_of_grrms/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9q3bfe/spoilers_twow_grrms_adwdtwow_writing_timeline_it/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/6mtciz/spoilers_extended_six_years_ago_today_a_dance/) for instance). But while a lot of the major elements of the Meereenese Knot have been unpacked, I believe there's more elements to discover.

And I think I've hit on one of those elements: **That a late ADWD chapter was originally going to be written from one POV character's perspective, but GRRM later discarded this particular draft of the chapter before picking that draft chapter back up and rewriting it with the perspective of a brand, new POV.**

Are you confused? Good. It only gets more granular from here on out!
***
##POV Changes

Let's talk a little theory before we get into some more solid material. ADWD was a beast of a book to write. While the cast of characters was quite vast by ADWD (16 POV Characters with an additional Prologue and Epilogue POV), the major problem was a viewpoint problem in Meereen.

In Meereen, GRRM always knew that Daenerys Targaryen was going to depart Meereen atop Drogon for the Dothraki Sea. In fact, [a very early Dany POV chapter](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/asoiaf/daenerys-ii-spoilers-for-adwd-t3024.html#.UYrHqisQIWA) that [George wrote back in 2001](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/5431) featured the return of Drogon (Whether Dany was going to fly off with Drogon then or later remains a question in my mind).

But this presented the narrative with a problem: Who would tell the story of Meereen in Dany's absence? In that, GRRM had possible candidates, but they presented flaws:

- Tyrion Lannister was coming to Daenerys with the intent that he would ""intersect"" with the Dragon Queen at some point in the story. But the problem was that he was unfamiliar with Meereen, its language, its culture and the various players orbiting Daenerys' court in Meereen.
- Quentyn Martell was also coming for Dany, but, like Tyrion, he was an outsider to Meereen.
- Victarion was on his way to Meereen as well, but he is an idiot.

So, GRRM attempted to cut the Meereenese Knot but kept [running into problems.](https://grrm.livejournal.com/94671.html) until in 2010, GRRM came upon a solution: [introduce Ser Barristan Selmy as a POV Character.](https://grrm.livejournal.com/129885.html) In Barristan, George was able to have an insider within Meereen who know the plots and players yet remained something of an outsider who could function in the vital plot roles of taking down Hizdahr zo Loraq and re-igniting the Sons of the Harpy insurgency and the Battle of Fire.

The Meereenese Knot, Barristan as a POV Character and his role in slashing the Meereenese Knot is well-known at this point. But what's not so well known is **how** Barristan actually helped George to cut the Meereenese Knot.
***
##Abandoned Drafts 

In 2016, GRRM was asked a question (h/t /u/zionius_ for the link):

&gt; Questioner: ""Do you often write the different outcomes of a chapter from both P.O.V. characters who share the same setting? TWOW has so many of them converging, I could understand you wanting to see which is the stronger route to go if you were to see it from the opposite perspective.""

He responded:

&gt; **GRRM:** I did some of that (My Editorial note: *switching POVs*) in DANCE when I was struggling with the Meereenese knot, and also in FEAST with those kingsmoot chapters ... but elsewise, nah, usually know which POV will work best before I begin. - [GRRM Notablog Comment, ""A Taste of This, A Taste of That"", 5/11/2016](https://grrm.livejournal.com/487298.html?page=6#comments)

I had never read this quote before /u/zionius_ brought it to my attention, but it made me wonder: *What POVs did George switch for the Meereenese Knot in ADWD?* And then it dawned on me: **Barristan Selmy.** Yes, our stalwart kingsguard knight was introduced with the intent to cut the Meereenese Knot. So, it would make logical sense that George switched him in for other POV characters in Meereen.

Then I wondered whether there was a particular place where one POV was replaced and Barristan was added in. And I *think* I found at least one example so far: **[ADWD, The Discarded Knight.](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Dance_with_Dragons-Chapter_59)**

Now, you'd be forgiven if you don't quite remember what occurred in this chapter. Briefly, it's a single-scene chapter set against an audience of King Hizdahr zo Loraq. The Yunkish come to Hizdahr's court and toss the head of Admiral Groleo at Hizdahr's feet and then demand the destruction of Dany's two remaining dragons.

But there's another piece in the chapter: Barristan notices that Quentyn and his Dornish companions are in the throne room, and after the audience is done, he confronts Quentyn and his companions and tells them to get out of dodge before they get themselves killed. 

So, we have Quentyn and Barristan present in a single-scene chapter. This is a likely spot where George replaced Quentyn with Barristan as the POV for the chapter. But I think this one actually goes beyond ""likely theory."" Because! 

In that same *So Spake Martin* from 2012 that I quoted in the intro, George talked more about Quentyn Martell and his role within the Meereenese Knot. And he said something fascinating about how he wrote Quentyn's introduction to Meereen. Namely, **George wrote three version of Quentyn's arrival in Meereen.** 

And one of those draft versions of when Quentyn arrives in Meereen is quite intriguing for our purposes:

&gt; I wrote three different versions of Quentyn's arrival at Meereen: one where he arrived long before Dany's marriage, **one where he arrived much later**, and one where he arrived just the day before the marriage (which is how it ended up being in the novel). And I had to write all three versions to be able to compare and see how these different arrival points affected the stories of the other characters."" - [So Spake Martin, 7/28/2012](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Asshai.com_Interview_in_Barcelona/)

So, here's what I think happened. In 2007, George wrote an [ADWD chapter](https://grrm.livejournal.com/15293.html) about ""a wedding."" I think this was likely Dany's marriage to Hizdahr zo Loraq as [a week prior](https://grrm.livejournal.com/15035.html) to writing this wedding chapter, GRRM was full of ""Dany, Jon and ""Q"" (Probably Quentyn Martell) thoughts."" At some point between 2007 and 2010, GRRM did some experimentation with drafting three different versions of Quentyn's arrival in Meereen. One of those version was Quentyn arriving ""much later"" in the narrative. I think that draft chapter was abandoned by GRRM as he decided on having Quentyn arrive a day before Dany's marriage to Hizdahr zo Loraq.

But! **I think much later on, GRRM ended up resurrecting this ""Quentyn arrives long after Dany is married to Hizdahr"" draft chapter, rewriting it with Barristan Selmy as the POV Character.** I'd go on to say that ""The Discarded Knight"" was among the final chapters that GRRM wrote for ADWD as he talked about finishing ""two short chapters"" in [late March 2011](https://grrm.livejournal.com/204875.html), and ""The Discarded Knight"" is a short late-ADWD chapter.
***
##Conclusion

The more I delve into GRRM's writing of ADWD, the more I find it fascinating. Perhaps part of my fascinating derives from a shared sympathy of the burden of writing fiction and how rewriting is extraordinarily difficult but ultimately rewarding. 

Part of my fascinating, too, is my belief that ADWD remains George's best book in ASOIAF. Seeing the amount of George's effort and finally noticing some of the details of how the effort came about makes the book that much more enjoyable.

So, I've thrown a lot of words at unpacking what I think is one instance where George switched Barristan in as a POV for a chapter that was likely-written from the POV of Quentyn Martell. Now, I turn it over to you all. In that notablog quote, George indicated that there were ""some"" instances where he switched the POV of certain chapters. What other examples of ADWD or AFFC chapters (remember GRRM talked about switching the kingsmoot POVs around too!) do you see where GRRM changed the POV Character?

3. Ellaria and the Sand Snakes are skeptical of this plan. Tyene sets out to sabotage it.
4. Myrcella is pregnant w/ Trystane's child and Doran holds her hostage in the Spear Tower.
5. Trystane objects to wife's captivity, and wants to ditch the imminent war and run away with Myrcella.
6. Jaime shows up to rescue Myrcella from captivity, along with Bronn, Ilyn Payne and a few red shirts.
7. A Tower of Joy style confrontation occurs. Areo Hotah is killed.
8. Jaime accidentally kills Trystane. Myrcella's baby is stillborn. She dies due to childbirth/grief/poison.
9. Trystane's death pushes Doran to declare war. Ellaria introduces him to Varys, who she's been plotting with.
10. Tyene is legitimized as the new Princess of Dorne. Ellaria and the Sand Snakes are cool with this plan.",asoiaf

&gt; A Storm of Swords - Daenerys VI

&gt; “Your Grace?” Missandei stood at her elbow wrapped in a bedrobe, wooden sandals on her feet. “I woke, and saw that you were gone. Did you sleep well? What are you looking at?”

&gt; “My city,” said Dany. “I was looking for a house with a red door, but by night all the doors are black.”

&gt; “A red door?” Missandei was puzzled. “What house is this?”

&gt; “No house. It does not matter.” Dany took the younger girl by the hand. “Never lie to me, Missandei. Never betray me.”

&gt; “I never would,” Missandei promised.

&gt; A Dance with Dragons - Daenerys II

&gt; “Daenerys. Remember the Undying. Remember who you are.”

&gt; “The blood of the dragon.” _But my dragons are roaring in the darkness_. “I remember the Undying. _Child of three_, they called me. Three mounts they promised me, three fires, and three treasons. One for blood and one for gold and one for …”

&gt; “Your Grace?” Missandei stood in the door of the queen’s bedchamber, a lantern in her hand. “Who are you talking to?”

---

These two pieces fit perfectly with GRRM’s method of foreshadowing, suggesting that Missandei will be the treason for love. If it happened only once in ASoS, we might have thought GRRM could have easily set it aside if he wanted and perhaps he did so. Note that with a 5 year gap, Missandei would have been 15-16 by the time of this expected treason for love at the end. But GRRM doubles down on this in ADwD, despite dropping the 5 year gap in between, creating an extra book and doing massive revisions and retcons. Without a gap to age up Missandei, GRRM might perhaps find other types of love (e.g. family) to make the prophecy work.

I know that with the show’s ending in mind, Jon seems like the treason for love. But what about these clues? Can Missandei and Jon together have something to do with Dany’s downfall at the end? How do you think Missandei might feature into the treason for love (if at all)?

By the way, both instances take place just before the dawn.

&gt;When Sansa and Harrold first meet, he is a complete ass to her to the dismay of the Waynwoods. At the end of the conversation, Sansa thinks to herself the following : ""***And may your horse stumble, Harry the Heir, so you fall on your stupid head in your*** ***first*** ***tilt***."" Could this be a foreshadowing for his death ? Maybe, maybe not, we will see. 

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/c2f7jm/spoilers\_main\_weekly\_q\_and\_a/erk8pok/](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/c2f7jm/spoilers_main_weekly_q_and_a/erk8pok/) 

To which I replied

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Oddly enough, Sansa curses another jouster, during the celebrations for Joffrey's birthday.*  
&gt;  
&gt;""Ser Balon Swann, of Stonehelm in the Red Watch,"" came the herald's cry. Wide white wings ornamented Ser Balon's greathelm, and black and white swans fought on his shield. ""Morros of House Slynt, heir to Lord Janos of Harrenhal.""  
""Look at that upjumped oaf,"" Joff hooted, loud enough for half the yard to hear. Morros, a mere squire and a new-made squire at that, was having difficulty managing lance and shield. The lance was a knight's weapon, Sansa knew, the Slynts lowborn. Lord Janos had been no more than commander of the City Watch before Joffrey had raised him to Harrenhal and the council.  
I hope he falls and shames himself, she thought bitterly. I hope Ser Balon kills him. When Joffrey proclaimed her father's death, it had been Janos Slynt who seized Lord Eddard's severed head by the hair and raised it on high for king and crowd to behold, while Sansa wept and screamed.  
Morros wore a checkered black-and-gold cloak over black armor inlaid with golden scrollwork. On his shield was the bloody spear his father had chosen as the sigil of their new-made house. But he did not seem to know what to do with the shield as he urged his horse forward, and Ser Balon's point struck the blazon square. Morros dropped his lance, fought for balance, and lost. One foot caught in a stirrup as he fell, and the runaway charger dragged the youth to the end of the lists, head bouncing against the ground. Joff hooted derision. Sansa was appalled, wondering if the gods had heard her vengeful prayer. But when they disentangled Morros Slynt from his horse, they found him bloodied but alive.  
&gt;  
&gt;*A Clash of Kings* \- Sansa I  

&amp;#x200B;

It seemed odd that GRRM would have two instances of Sansa ill-wishing the participant of a tourney, with such similar wording.  While neither curse is spoken aloud, thank the old gods and the new, we readers are aware Sansa, quite understandably, has indulged in a very dangerous line of thought. In Westerosi history women who curse others normally do so before their deaths. F&amp;B I has a number of such instances,  most notably Queen Rhaenyra. 

   

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, we have another other curse  to consider here, perhaps the most famous of Sansa's curses, given the fact that GGRM is recorded as having changed the manner of Janos Slynt's death to accomodate it

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Frog-faced Lord Slynt sat at the end of the council table wearing a black velvet doublet and a shiny cloth-of-gold cape, nodding with approval every time the king pronounced a sentence. **Sansa stared hard at his ugly face, remembering how he had thrown down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead, wishing she could hurt him, wishing that some hero would throw him down and cut off his head.** But a voice inside her whispered, There are no heroes, and she remembered what Lord Petyr had said to her, here in this very hall. ""Life is not a song, sweetling,"" he'd told her. ""You may learn that one day to your sorrow."" In life, the monsters win, she told herself, and now it was the Hound's voice she heard, a cold rasp, metal on stone. ""Save yourself some pain, girl, and give him what he wants.""   

 *A Game of Thrones* \- Sansa VI

My bolding.

We know how Janos Slynt died 

&gt; The smile that Lord Janos Slynt smiled then had all the sweetness of rancid butter. Until Jon said, ""Edd, fetch me a block,"" and unsheathed Longclaw.   

 *A Dance with Dragons* \- Jon II

&amp;#x200B;

That's three men cursed or ill-wished, which seems to be pointing to something dark in Sansa's future. Will she become aware she's capable of ill-wishing others?   

&amp;#x200B;

Most disquieting, in light of those curses, is this superstitious   view of her  

&gt;""I forgot, you've been hiding under a rock. The northern girl. Winterfell's daughter. We heard she killed the king with a spell, and afterward changed into a wolf with big leather wings like a bat, and flew out a tower window.    

 *A Storm of Swords* \- Arya XIII   

&amp;#x200B;

I fear Sansa is either going to be accused of witchcraft by others, possibly at King's Landing, or worse yet, accuses herself of witchcraft.  

Is it possible Sansa will understand her warg nature, which I think, will eventually bloom, in terms of witchcraft?  

Her siblings all take their warg nature in different ways.  

It's implied Robb uses his to help win battles, that Jon fights against his nature, that Bran is capable of flying high yet sinking into abomination for his own pleasure, that Arya accepts her abiblities with without questioning them and Rickon, well, we have yet to learn about Rickon's path as a warg.  

&amp;#x200B;

I worry about Sansa. 

Like her beloved Lady, will she die to satisfy Southern ways of thought about witchcraft?  

Or will she be able to keep this secret to herself, and live a life of inner conflict with her gifts?",asoiaf

&amp;#x200B;

The Night King is (as far as we know) a Show only character, and according to D&amp;D themselves, they've known that [Arya is going to be the one to kill the NK](https://youtu.be/ZJ1yC3yESLQ?t=532) for only three years. It's unclear if this is a GRRM decision or not, but it would be odd if he didn't tell them about such a seemingly important moment back in 2013 when he told them how the story ends. so it sounds like a D&amp;D decision. which is weird...

&amp;#x200B;

I find it concerning that it feels like D&amp;D are the ones who made that decision because that is her only contribution in the final act of the story, does this mean that GRRM provided basically nothing to D&amp;D in regards to Arya's story back in 2013? Does GRRM himself know what to do with her?

Arya is a weird character because unlike the other ASOIAF main characters, she isn't that involved in either the political game of thrones or the threat of the white walkers. I just struggle to see what's the point of her after how her story went in S7/8.",asoiaf
"So I’ve read ASOIAF 3 times, and recently decided to listen to the audiobook version. Anyhow I just realized that Jon and Robb are older than Daenerys. They are both 14 and Dany is 13 at the start of AGOT. For some reason I always thought Dany was older.",asoiaf
Saw someone on Reddit say they liked the books more because so many good characters are left out of the show. What characters were your favorites that didn’t make it to the show?,asoiaf
"From the sample chapter Mercy, we see that Arya might be going rogue in regards to the FM.

Also, there have been many discussions here about how weird it is that she betrayed the FM and there were no repurcussions in the show.

So that got me thinking: what if there are repercussions, and that is the assassination, and loosing of her face.

Yadda yadda yadda, GRRM can't kill her and etc.

BUT

I'm trying to think like a FM here.

They have an inkling of her true origins, once she proves to be not FM material, they might have to shut her up to not spill any secrets.

That would come with a brand new face to use, maybe for the waif.

This would allow fmArya to infiltrate the upper eschelon of Westeros leadership at a pivotal moment, assuming the show is somewhat in line with what happens in the book.

Bravoosi do not like dragonlords, and we might end up with at least two in Westeros (Jon and Dany)

If they want to take them out, an Arya mask would be the perfect in.

"&gt;The thought of home disquieted her. If her sun-and-stars had lived, he would have led his khalasar across the poison water and swept away her enemies, but his strength had left the world. Her bloodriders remained, sworn to her for life and skilled in slaughter, but only in the ways of the horselords. The Dothraki sacked cities and plundered kingdoms, they did not rule them. **Dany had no wish to reduce King’s Landing to a blackened ruin full of unquiet ghosts.** She had supped enough on tears. I want to make my kingdom beautiful, to fill it with fat men and pretty maids and laughing children.

"When considering siege engines this is the first one that comes to my mind. A helepolis is basically a huge mobile tower that you can use to deploy troops on an opponents battlements. Thereby circumventing most of the defenses. It wasn't built very long after the trebuchet which I believe is commonly mentioned in the books. 

Are there any examples of anything representing a helepolis on a song of ice and fire?",asoiaf

"I've always wondered why GRRM would tell us his planned ending. He's worked so hard at building suspense and writing the unthinkable, keeping his readers on their toes while his characters do the unexpected. Knowing the basic outline completely destroyes the shock value when it happens, regardless of the story buildup to it. 
So why tell us the ending?

But, what if he hasn't? We have all just assumed that the books will end basically as the show did, have we all thrown away the possibility that they don't? 

Maybe GRRM didnt tell D&amp;D his true ending. Maybe he did and they decided not to spoil it. After all, after season 8 episode 3, they did admit that they ""decided Arya would defeat the Night King in season 3"" but if they already knew the ending, why would they choose to change it so early? 
Obviously none of us were there at lunch with them that day so theres no way we know what was said, we are only just assuming theyre telling the truth. (Yes, I know he expected to finish the books before the show but if that was the case then it could be argued that he would just wait to tell them)
My point is, we are just believing the heresay but it is very well possible that we DONT know the ""basic outline"" of how it will all end.  Maybe we do. But maybe we dont. 

It just doesn't seem like GRRM to let on what is going to happen.",asoiaf
"By loaded I mean chapters most densely packed with information about characters, or foreshadowing about the future etc., so basically what you might consider the most important chapters. The greatest examples I can think of is Dany's visions in House of the Undying, Jaime's fever dream and Cersie's visit to Maggy the Frog. 

Obviously all the prologues and epilogues probably count as well, but other than those what other chapters do you guys think are the most 'loaded'?",asoiaf
"Imagine Tyrion does not kill Tywin and he goes to Castle Black instead of escaping to Pentos. This means Varys would still be in service to Tywin.   
What would Tywin do? He would try to marry Cersei off I guess. There's Willas Tyrell I imagine. Maybe Balon Greyjoy (lol).  
  
He would also want Jaime to inherit Casterly Rock. So he dismisses him from the KG. Then I suppose Jaime would need a wife. There's plenty of lovely potential brides: Asha Greyjoy (to strengthen the ties between the iron islands and the IT), Desmera Redwyne (powerful house), Malora Hightower(another powerful house). I'm not sure if Arianne would be a good bride at this time cus Oberyn was killed.    
   
Who do you think Tywin would marry Cersei and Jaime to?     
How would Tywin deal with the Sparrow situation?  
How would he deal with the Ironborn and fAegon?",asoiaf
"On the topic of an 8th book, what name would you give to the 8th book?",asoiaf
"I mean, just think of all the fillers scenes, for instance:

- The dragons being stolen in Qarth;
- The romance between Missandei and Greyworm;
- Jon going north of the wall to fight the mutineers led by Locke and almost meeting Bran;
- The Hound and Arya meeting Brienne;
- Yara/Asha and the Ironbon going to the Dreadfort to rescue Theon and being scared away by a shirtless Ramsay;
- Stannis and Davos going to Braavos to get a loan from the Iron Bank;
- Jaime and Bronn going to Dorne and meeting the Sand Snakes (and their ""bad poosay"");
- Did we really need all those sexposition scenes during the early seasons?

I'm sure there were more useless filler scenes, but these are the ones I remember right now. If these scenes were cut, couldn't the show have introduced Young Griff, Victarion, Lady Stoneheart, Arianne or Euron's horn?",asoiaf

"  

Spending almost all my time since 2011 practically worshiping this series, and I will most likely continue until the end of my days, I find myself thinking a lot about what has happened from ""Winter is Coming"" to ""The Iron Throne"". And I fit somewhere in between not liking the ending character arcs to thinking it's satisfactory. Here is my main character breakdown of what was right and/or what was wrong:

&amp;#x200B;

Jon - Has always been my favorite (Go House Stark!!... Or Targaryen?) and he has been the most noble of them all regardless of all the trials put before him. There is just something not full about his character. I feel like if he were to kill Dany then he should have killed himself, or even said ""dracarys"" for treason and breaking an oath. But it contradicts all other oaths that he has made like protecting the realm. Regardless, I feel like he should have killed himself. (I know, I'm just trying not to be bias)

&amp;#x200B;

Dany - My second love of my life. Well, she did what she has always wanted to do and just completely destroy the crap out of King's Landing. But doing this has made it to where her army was doing things she was completely against, like raping the villagers. Then she became a Tyrant even before the Kings landing battle but saying she’s going to kill all tyrants? Unsullied probably should have killed her at that point for being another tyrant and that may have been justifiable.

&amp;#x200B;

Sansa – Don’t really have many words about Sansa. She is like Dany in a lot of sense, but Sansa is Dany late in the series while Dany matured early. But I feel like Sansa is more careful than Dany and she tries to play by ear to feel the crowd. I feel that Sansa should be alive, but I feel like more things should have challenged her. Dany trying to kill her for example, or in prison for treason temporarily.

&amp;#x200B;

Arya – Should she have killed the Night King? We want that battle between Night King and Jon, and I feel that battle should have happened, but ultimately, I feel Arya should have killed him. She is the hidden weapon that the Starks needed for survival. Teamwork for the win! She is cocky and I don’t like that and I feel like she should have acted more like Brienne of Tarth when it came to her sexuality. She isn’t a lady after all and that was supposed to be an important thing to her, but if she did do it then she should have stayed with Gendry. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ned Stark – I’m disappointed that he did not rise in the crypt…

&amp;#x200B;

Bran – I don’t think he should have been King, maybe an advisor or such cause of his ability but it just makes him completely OP. It wouldn’t matter who sits on the throne because if they have Bran then they just win cause of his sight, but if he were to stay in the North, it would keep everyone from invading cause he would know. The North would have been safe for at least 60 years, though I can say it’ll be safe while even though he is on the Throne.

&amp;#x200B;

Clegane – I would have liked to see that his fight with his brother was not the end to his story. They could have added more by setting sail with Arya as a shipmate or whatever. Or brought him back to his house he was building to finish it, and start farming. Farmer Clegane, sounds right.

&amp;#x200B;

Varys – I understand killing him but it should have been done differently. I would have liked to see how a dragon eats rather than burn things. And I feel like Varys and Littlefinger should have changed places, though not die in season 7 and kept working in the favor of the Starks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Greyjoys – Both of them were poorly thought out. Though I’m happy for Theon, Yara was the weak link. Where was she in Kings Landing’s fight? Still holding a retreat for an army that’s not coming anymore? 

&amp;#x200B;

Cersei – Season 1-7 she was the most evil person in Westeros, why was her character lacking so much? She didn’t even do anything besides order someone else to cut someone’s head off and lied about the baby daddy. Was there even a baby? That would have been an interesting twist. And what’s the timeframe between all of these events from season 7 to season 8? A little math suggests that a few months should have past and it looked like she wasn’t showing at all from when it was mentioned she was pregnant in season 7.

&amp;#x200B;

Jaime – Not much to change or talk about, its Jaime. And I don’t think his character was hurt any in season 8.

&amp;#x200B;

Tyrion – Tyrion was such a careful person in all the other seasons and he just gave up. He didn’t try to influence very much he just did as he was told and watched the aftermath. I think he should have had a larger role. He defended Kings Landing during the Blackwater he should have worked on both defending and invasion. What they did right was him talking to Jon to convince him to kill Dany, what they did wrong was how closed of a person he was. I can see why they turned that way, Season 7 kind of suggested that that was the way he was going but he should have developed different.

&amp;#x200B;

Robin – My, you have grown up so much. But you’re still disgusting despite all the character adjustments. Blaming your mom.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what was missing? It was the Games that was missing. The head games, the trying to use their minds to defeat each other. The only persons that seemed to have it together was Varys and Sansa, and all the others are masters at it. Cersei should have played it out saying that as long as she kept her titles (minus being Queen) there didn’t need to be a war and the Throne could have been Dany’s , new generations do not need to be punished for past crimes, Dany would be advised to accept. While at a gathering in a neutral territory, to celebrate on the same day, Varys should have taken the idea from the Frays and created a new Red Wedding while working with Cersei. Tyrion should have known something like this would happen and meanwhile try to play his own game to counter but fails, secretly happy about it. This would have upsetted everyone in the North and the Unsullied and Jon should have then became commander of the army rather than King. Drogon, being a smart dragon, should still show grief but I think in a more destructive way like burning Kings Landing and Jon, being Targaryen, could have retamed or settled the grieving Drogon. Then the secret of him being the true heir and being a Targaryen could have came out. Though still not accepting his throne, he nominates a King, kinda leaning towards Gendry (don’t hate me). That would be a better game. This is my opinion and I hope you guys liked this last paragraph too.",gameofthrones
"In the (relatively disappointing) final season, the Golden Company did not seem to live up to their reputation at all. It was just another disappointment of the final season. They faced off against a dragon and Dany's armies in a standard formation, somehow expecting to succeed where all of the other armies she had faced had failed with that same set-up. Maybe this was just a function of the crappy plot design by the show-writers, or maybe the Golden Company was all hype in the books too? Please let me know which.",gameofthrones
"Ser Allisser Thorne is one of the best characters in the show that nobody remembers...  

I remember the first time I saw this thinking that this guy was just an ass who hated Jon Snow.  Now I realize that he was actually a very honorable man and he made Jon Snow into the man he was in the end.  

He was a tough man, but he needed to be.  He had the job of taking criminal low lives and high borns and turning them into men of the knights watch.  The knights watch doesn’t have many soldiers so the few that they have need to be good.  He’s basically the drill Sargent who gets in your face and calls you a walking pile of pig shit because he wants to make a man out of you.  The speech he gave at castle black before the wildlings attacked and the way he charged straight into battle with his men makes you realize that the nights watch truly meant everything to him.  Just as it did to Qhorin Halfhand, another great character. 

I remember watching Dolorous Edd getting stabbed in the back while picking up Sam Tarly’s fat ass off the floor and thinking “I guess Jon sticking up for Tarly in season one during his training might not have been the best thing to do after all”.  

He even taught Jon Snow a lesson when he stabbed him.  Before being executed Thorne told Snow “I had a choice Lord Commander, betray you or betray the nights watch” he went on to say “if I had to do it all over knowing where I’d end up, I pray I would make the right choice again”. A lesson that came in handy when Jon was put to the similar choice in the end.   Betray Daenerys or betray the people of Westeros, knowing that killing her would mean almost certain death by Drogon. 

Just my thoughts...",gameofthrones

"I recently started watching the series “Attack On Titan” on Netflix and from the first episode on I was thinking: That’s how you handle humans fighting a completely overpowered villain!
You actually see the titans be incredibly strong and nearly undefeatable, especially the really big guys and have them kill a fifth of their population. You make the walls both a good line of defense but also kind of a trap if the titans were to break through. With strategic points and many layers of wall you can somehow contain the intruders, retreat and have a little more time to think of a good strategy and attach again. This is a real battle that takes a lot of time, thinking and courage. 
You see the average townfolk being victims of the war like getting killed, suffering from food shortages (for a longer period of time) and from the constant fear of an attack. GOT kind of showed that, although it could have been done better. But that plays in to the whole argument of there being not enough time in the whole last season, so that’s not my biggest point here.

I’m just saying, D &amp; D could have learned a lot from “Attack On Titan” when it comes to making the threat of a nearly omnipotent power both realistic and defeatable.",gameofthrones
"Unsurprisingly, the final two seasons are a bit hard to come to terms with.

"Not sure I've seen this specific line discussed. S5E2 Ser Barristan, ""But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved, and each time it made him feel powerful and right until the very end.""

&amp;#x200B;

The people who keep saying Dany would never have slaughtered Kings Landing need to re-watch the show. The signs are  there the whole time..there just disguised as her being the hero. The quote above says it all. Every time she gives someone the justice she thinks they deserve, she feels more powerful and right. She has gone through so much during her journey, and it all goes to hell at the very end. She loses her most trusted advisers, Jorah and Missandei. One to the the ultimate evil against men, the other by a brutal beheading from her enemies. Dany is betrayed by her other adviser in Varys, because the man she is in love with and who can no longer love her back is ultimately the true heir.. a total screw you to her entire life meaning. And finally, Westeros does not share any of the love she thought she would receive. Alll she really does have is fear to rule with, and a goal to break the wheel. While the goal may be commendable, she thinks that what she's doing to break it is right, because her past has taught her so. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do think the show botched the visualization of how Dany slaughtered Kingslanding in S8E5. It was epic for sure but the show should have made it a point for the audience to see more of the Lannister army and Golden company littered throughout ALL of the city. Instead of it looking like shes just killing the innocent for the sake of revenge, it should have looked like they were casualties of war. Maybe they thought that would be understood but it's pretty clear that's not the case with the backlash.",gameofthrones
"I'm still trying to process what we got in Season 8. I have the same complaints that most people do about Season 8 in that it was *incredibly* rushed and the writers seemed to miss several beats necessary to make characters' actions believable (though I'd been complaining about that since Season 7, to be truthful).

But what I'm really wrestling with is the note the series ended on.

Daenerys's sinister turn took the show in a pretty dark direction. To be honest, I wasn't surprised that neither Jon nor Dany ended up on the throne given *Game of Thrones's* history of giving us something your usual fantasy wouldn't. *But* I was very surprised at how we arrived at our ending (I thought they'd abdicate).

My issue is that Dany's turn is dark. Jon's assassination of her is dark. But then, suddenly... it's pretty happy, considering? Bran is king. Tyrion becomes Hand. Sansa is Queen in the North. Jon doesn't get pegged with a job he never wanted and goes to the place his heart has always called him (if Ghost, his familiar, being sent up there early wasn't an obvious hint, I don't know what is).

Was anyone else thrown off by this? Especially since Tyrion was acting like it was a sour outcome (D&amp;D seemed to appoint Tyrion meta-commentator since all his speeches seemed constructed purely to fill in the gaps in the writing).

But let's rewind for a minute.

Bran is king. Bran, the guy possessed by an omniscient spirit of a race once violently opposed to humans, the very race that created the White Walkers to wipe out humanity. Bran, the guy who only revealed that he could see the future all along *after* he'd been nominated as king. Bran, the one who encouraged Sam to plant the seed that caused the discord between Jon and Dany that presumably fueled her descent. Bran, who flash fried Hodor's mind. Bran, the Three-Eyed Crow (""All crows are liars,"" says Old Nan).

But no one says anything about it! Not one person says, ""We need to talk about Bran.""

Wouldn't *acknowledging* the inherent shadiness of Bran-as-child-god-king be--tonally, at least--more in step with the tragedy of the Targaryens? Wouldn't making us feel uneasy about his rule from a place of ""this is dark"" be better than making us feel uneasy because ""we're leaving you with a ton of unanswered questions about Bran but tell you you're supposed to feel happy about this"" feels hollow and instructive?

Don't get me wrong--there were aspects of the season I could appreciate in spite of my criticisms, and I don't dislike Bran. If anything, I like him and am upset at how underutilized he was. But the tonal shift of the last episode midway through was so dramatic for me I can't help but wonder if it would've been better if Bran had been depicted as a darker figure, and whether George had those plans for him (if he ever finished writing the books). I remember his original outline saying that Bran and Jon became bitter rivals and Bran begins to use magic for magic's sake, which makes me think George had planned him to become corrupted by his powers.

I guess I thought I'd just see if anyone was as thrown off by the shift of the finale as much as I was, and whether you think going even darker could've been a solution.",gameofthrones
"When Dany burns the Red Keep, I remember the walls exploding as if they were hit by cannonballs instead of dragonfire, and thinking it was strange. I don't remember Drogon physically attacking the castle, only burning it, so it doesn't make sense how the castle's walls were flying to pieces, enough to literally being it down. I'm rereading the books now, and in Clash of Kings it describes how when Harranhal was attacked by dragons, the stone melted.

"Hi there :) 
This is a short comment on how the writers of Game of Thrones intened to continue the character arc of the Unsullied ... enjoy :) (warning again: I'm being very flat-jokey)

__________________________________________________________


So … by the end of Game of Thrones, Grey Worm and a number of other Unsullied set sail for the island of Naath to protect it’s people from further slavery, as he has promised to Missandei.
Unfortunately – this idea is rather naaith.
 
(You think this is a bad one? I just started XD)


Now, of course the Unsullied could succeed in sending one or two slaver ships back to their cities with ¾ of the men on board slain… but to send an army outnumbering them by 10 soliders each and take it back would probably take the slavers of Essos naa leth than a week. 
Not only that, but as revenge for being so naathty,, the slavers could simply take half of the island’s population, or even murder them along with the army. 


Of course, it’s not like naathing  can be done to fullfill the promise … but it would take a while. In my mind, the best option for the Unsullied would be to return to Mereen/Dario and try to fulfill Daenery’s vision of a more just Essos… if enough Dothraki returned with them, they would have a start of an army, and could proceed with trying to win more people with influence for their cause … it’s a very difficult task in the free cities that will require a lot of luck, but it’s much more benaathicial to everyone (potentially) involved, and Grey Worm would help building a world Missandei would have liked.


Plus, whoever he meets as a new love interest – naathing compares to her.

1) Did Ned know his sister married Rhaegar? I don’t believe Ned knew Lyanna was pregnant when he found her. Their marriage was a secret only a few people knew. I’m wondering if Ned knew Jon as a true Targaryen or as a bastard?

2) Aemons relation to Jon. Jon is his great nephew? Rhaegar is Aemons nephew? So Jon is Aemons great nephew?",gameofthrones
"I was just thinking back on Game of Thrones and all the theories. And I remembered reading about the Littlefinger's death theory, of him hiring a faceless man. Then said faceless man getting killed in his place by Sansa and Arya. It's a shame that they never did anything with this. But I guess it did create a substantial character development for Sansa.

What was the point of Rickon at all ? He was introduced as a little kid. Had little to no dialogue as far as I remember, dissappeared for almost all seasons, then appeared again only to be killed by Ramsay in a way that served no purpose.

  
He wasnt even ultilised as a plot device or anything, he was just cut off from the story unceremonially.

"First of all, how did you expect them to kill the night king? He had to die somehow before the real war (on episode 5).
To me it was surprising because I expected like always that Jon will come out from nowhere and save the day like he always do. I was so happy when he didn't.
Arya deserved it, and the whole episode being dark was on purpose, to desperate the watchers and show them how the soldiers felt during the long night against the white walkers. Also the track ""The Night King"" by Ramin was freaking amazing and the visuals were outstanding.
You can tell that the writing was trash and the battle decisions they made were dumb, like sending the whole Dothraki first to the giant army of the dead so they'll join them, but what else could they do? The army of the dead are like a gang of bees, going together to the same target like a tsunami, nothing could've stopped them.

And for episode 5 of Daenerys going mad, it really made sense to me. She lost EVERYTHING.
Jon couldn't keep 1 secret that Ned kept for a decade+
Sansa and Arya hated her.
The whole north hates her.
She lost 1/2 of her army in the long night.
She lost jorah.
She lost Missanderi (whatever you spell her name)
She lost 2 dragons.
Jon said he can't be with her as a husband.
Westros wanted Jon as king.

She had all the reasons to go mad, after she easily managed to destroy the whole army of Lannister and Greyjoy with a single dragon.

Really pissed me off that she got killed on episode 6.

Anyway, Episode 3 is better than S6E9 and Episode 5 is better than S6E10.

I love season 8.",gameofthrones
"This is my alternate ending for the White Walker plot. Most changes are to episode 3 with one small change to episode 2. Not all of these ideas are mine, some are inspired by other theories and rewrites that I have read. I did this for fun, I am not trying to do a better job than D&amp;D. So here goes:

Episode 2 stays mostly the same. The only difference is that at the end Sam tells Jon something he discovered about the Night King. The audience doesn't hear what it is. The only thing we do hear is Sam saying 'Don't tell Bran'

Episode 3 remains the same untill the last half hour. The only characters who's stories are different are Jon, Bran, Arya, Theon and Beric. The dragon battle between Jon, Dany and the Night King remains the same. Arya being chased through the castle remains mostly the same, except it is only the Hound that saves her, without Beric. They don't run into Melissandre and instead go to save the helpless people in the crypts. Arya clears out the wights in the crypt with ease, The Hound is impressed with her skill but is also mad that she didn’t leave any for him. At one point, Sansa kills a Wight with her dagger, Arya sees this and has a proud sister moment.

During the battle, Bran looks into the past to figure out how to beat the Night King. He sees a Stark ancestor standing up to the dead with a dragon glass sword (Implied to be Azor Ahai). He also goes back to the time of the Mad King and tries to convince him to prepare for the threat of the White Walkers. This goes horribly wrong, the Mad King begins to repeat 'Burn them all' and becomes obsessed with burning people. Bran returns to the present, exhausted.

Jorahs and Lyannas deaths remain the same, as does most of the main battle. The living are being overwhelmed by the sheer number of Wights. Jon is fighting his way through the battle. His choice to not save Sam is more emphasised, to show Jons story of choosing duty over love. Jon ducks behind a rock to avoid the blue flames of Viserion. He is joined by Beric, who tells him to get to the godswood. Before Jon can say a word, Beric runs at Viserion giving Jon time to get past. Beric dies.

Brans bodyguards are getting overwhelmed by the wights. Bran, now desperate, wargs back to when the Night King was created. Theons sacrifice plays out the same. Theon goes down, his eyes wide, grabbing at the dragon glass spear in his stomach.

In the past vision, Bran is standing in a field when he is grabbed by the Children of the Forest and tied to a weirwood tree. A dragon glass dagger is stabbed into his heart and his eyes turn blue. Bran didn't listen to the previous Three Eyed Raven’s warning of getting too enamoured with the past and paid the price. Bran opens his eyes to see the Night King standing over him. There is nothing of Bran left in the Night King, not really. The Night King is only here to ensure his creation because he has learned his lesson; to never tamper with the past. A voice calls out Brans name.

Jon runs through the godswood, strangely The White Walkers allow him to pass. Jon repeats 'Bran!' looking at the Night King. Jon knows of Brans fate. Jon pleads with the monster that used to be his brother to stop. The Night King ignores Jon, not even turning around. Jon means nothing to him. The Night King draws his blade and raises it, to stop Bran from going back into the past again to change his fate.

Jon lunges at the Night King. The Night King lazily parries the blow and knocks Jon to the ground with ease. Jon gets back up and attacks the Night King again, desperate to keep him away from Bran. Despite being outmatched, Jon keeps fighting, even managing to disarm the Night King. However, the Night King is too much for Jon in the end, grabbing Jon by the throat and lifting him into the air. As the Night King chokes the life out of Jon, the camera shows various beloved characters being overwhelmed by Wights, facing their doom.

Theon thrusts what's left of his dragon glass spear into the Night Kings back, piecing his heart. The White Walkers burst into shards of ice, the Wights crumble. The Night King lets go of Jon and falls against the weirwood tree. The blue glow leaves the Night Kings eyes. The Night King looks up at Jon and Theon without speaking a word, his real eyes, Brans eyes say a silent thank you. The Night King bursts into shards of ice.

Theon collapses, Jon catches him. Bran forgives Theon, telling him that he is a good man. Theon dies in Jons arms, redeemed not just as a Greyjoy but as a Stark.

Melissandre walks up to Jon, telling him that while the Great Other has been defeated, the long night is not yet over. She turns and walks away. Jon asks her where she is going, she tells him that she has played her part, but he has yet to play his. Melissandre takes off her neckless. Time catches up to her as she walks into the sunset one last time.

"Obviously this would never happen; however, I would have loved for Jon to depart for Valyria and attempt to figure out what happened with the Doom.

"What’s so badass to me is that you don’t need dragons, armies, assassin abilities, good fighting skills, etc to get very far or win the game of thrones. Don’t get me wrong all these things are cool too but what intrigues me the most is the power of the mind. My favorite Pokémon type has always been and always will be Psychic lol. I have always resonated with characters that are more brain than brawn (probably because I’m a nerd 😂) and Sansa and LF definitely showcase this the best. Bran does too but Bran just has hacks and he’s fairly boring. To me what’s so awesome is that this entire Lannister Stark conflict, the main plot of the whole series, the whole war of the 5 kings, nearly everything was caused by 1 person. Only 1 mind. All LF was, was a damn lord of a extremely minor holding on the Fingers, and he causes the whole damn thing and in the end he nearly had half of Westeros (as far as land goes) under control. And what’s so cool was that the only reason he really loses was to himself. He lost to his student so to speak.

What’s so epic is that dragons, armies, etc don’t matter when you play the game of thrones. The only real power is knowledge. As LF says, knowledge is power. True power, real power comes from the mind. LF was legit playing everyone and was playing the game of thrones the best until his student betters him. He was the player and everyone else was the pawns until Sansa. Now Sansa is the player of the “game”. To me my favorite part of Game of Thrones is the Game of Thrones. Is it just purely by coincidence that Sansa got exactly what she wanted (The North’s Independence) since the beginning of Season 8 by the end and is arguably the biggest winner of the “game”? Sansa knew how to play the game from her teachers and she played it well. You win the Game of Thrones by playing the Game of Thrones and Sansa is the most experienced player in the end. What I really love about Sansa is she is like the “Good LF” so to speak and what’s really awesome is that she showcases all of her teachers (LF, Cersei, Margaery, Olenna as well as herself) when she plays the game. I also think Sansa’s arc is awesome, going from a bratty naive girl to a smart, hardened and learned individual. She goes from not appreciating her family and her home to loving her home and her family more than ever, willing to do anything to protect her home and her family. 

I also love Littlefinger’s accent. Just like Sansa’s beauty is like the cherry on the sundae , Littlefinger’s accent is like the cherry on the sundae. He also has some amazing quotes. The “Chaos is a Ladder” speech scene is one of my favorite scenes of the entire series. I also really love the “Conspiracy” Theme that plays several times when he is on screen. Although it’s not technically his theme because it is played in other parts of the show that doesn’t include him, some people call it his theme (myself included) because it is most associated with him and because for the most part it plays when it involves him. It has a very ominous tone and I love it. Littlefinger is a very ominous and mysterious character and it’s what makes him so awesome and intriguing. Also Fun fact about Littlefinger was that he made his personal sigil a mockingbird. It’s cool because he knew the right things to say to the right ears at the right time which is analogous to how a mockingbird mimics and imitates other birds songs.",gameofthrones
"I’ve been thinking quite a bit about the finale and wanted to gather my thoughts. Correct me if I have inaccurate basis for these please.

We all watched Jon and Danerys fall in love. We all saw what seemed to be the unraveling of D’s sanity. We all saw Jon Snow stab her. We all know Jon Snow and his vows he holds with honor. 

In the beginning of the season we saw Jon and Dany by the waterfall. Dany said they could stay 1000 years and nobody would know. She also mentioned how her dragons hated the cold and lack of food. 

Jon is loyal to two things his family and his queen. Danerys is loyal to her goal breaking the wheel. Assuming Jon never stabbed Dany he would have let his family down and in essence betrayed them had he married Dany. Had Dany married Jon took the throne she would have been strengthening the wheel not breaking it. 

How do these two characters madly in love both meet there goals and stay true to there moral compass. Easily pull off the power move of the century. 

Let’s rewind in order to exist for 1000 years in hot universe one has to die first and come back to life. Jon died and his body was protected until he was brought back to life. In theory wouldn’t Danerys have to suffer the same fate in order to stay with Jon 1000 years.

Danerys trust one person besides herself she trusts Jon Snow. Danerys isn’t dumb or silly or foolish. She is a calculated Khalessi. The knight king wanted to kill Bran to kill the memories of man. What if Khaleesi killed Kings Landing and the Red Keep and the iron throne to do the same. 

Danerys was isolated when she died. Jon told her he would always be his queen as she preached about them breaking the wheel. Greyworm and the Dothraki would have insisted on post death customs. Jon sat with his love and protected her while Drogon destroyed the highest ideaology of the wheel the Iron Throne then gently carried her to exactly where she wanted to be with her wheel broken and with Jon Snow in Valyria for 1000 years and no one will find them .

Wheel broken only person who would want to seek Jon or Danerys out on his way to certain death on Naah.",gameofthrones

"So Daenerys's Vision in Season 2 Episode 10 of the HBO adaptation. I am sure many of you have noticed that it is the ruined King's Landing, but I have seen many people wondering why it seemed King's Landing did not end up a snow-covered ruin that they appeared to be showing.

Now I have, since seeing the finale, come up with two hypotheses:

1.) ***Ashy Throne Room***

This is just as it sounds: the thing we thought was snow was all along ash. This seems likely, I mean it looked more like ash than snow but that could just be because of lighting or set issues in the shot. This would mean that it was *literally* showing Dany what was going to happen at the end of her life. Dany saw the wreckage of King's Landing after her arrival. She was shown what her last act ever would be: the destruction of King's Landing.

2.) ***Winter Triumphs***

* *The Outcome.* Now this one is less direct. It revolves around how in the end, the Stark's gained all the power (only for now in The Kingdoms, but yes, but they did). A Stark rules at The Wall, a Stark rules The North, and a Stark rules The Six Kingdoms. King's Landing, a husk of its past self, ruled by winter. Dany's destructive power demonstration set the stage for her downfall and the Stark rise.
* *The Death.* Now there is one thing I think holds true of this vision no matter what way you look at it; it is a death vision. Daenerys is witnessing where her life will end and where she will next meet her lover and her child. She was unable to sit in the throne just as she was unable to ever take her seat there in the very end. This being known, the snow could be simply be representative of the fact that Jon Snow was the man who rang in her death. He brought the end before she could ever reach her final goal.

This is all opinion and stuff I have come up with on my own. I had no intention of basing this off anything else out there, and it is simply meant as some food for thought.

"Today I watched Roose Bolton getting killed by his son. Ramsay then let his men send letters to the other houses that Roose was poisoned by his enemies. After Ramsay was killed in the BotB I think no person that is still alive knows that in fact he wasn't poisoned  but killed by his own son. I then thought that there have to be other very important cases where we as the viewers know what happened but that are forgotten in the show world because there is no one still alive who was there which makes it quite interesting or sad, depends on the case. The one thing that came to my mind was Joffrey being poisoned by Olenna Tyrell. There were probably some people within House Tyrell who know but it got erased in S7 and the only one Olenna told it was Jamie (who then told it Cersei) but they aren't alive anymore. I don't think the Lannisters would spread this because Cersei wanted everyone to believe that Tyrion killed him. Also, you could add Cleganebowl as Arya probably knew it was gonna happen but doesn't know how it ended.

"I know the last season gets a lot of hate, and deservedly so (writing was subpar, rushed the heel turn with so few episodes, and the fact GoT died when it became more about spectacle than nuance), but Tyrion’s/Dinklage’s acting was incredible. His final goodbyes with Varys and Jaime were nothing short than heartbreaking. 

Varys “Goodbye old friend”
Tyrion, looks up at him, grabs his arm, has no words. (And the music too! Incredible)

Me, crying uncontrollably

Tyrion standing over Jaime sitting “you’re the only one who didn’t treat me like a monster. You were all I had” Jaime with tears in his eyes looking up at Tyrion  and then the best hug ever between them. 

Me, absolutely bawling

That’s 9 years of friendship/family saying goodbye to each other one last time. And it was absolutely heartbreaking. Bravo Peter Dinklage and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau for amazing work!

"In regards to Season 8 Episode 5 The Bells, everyone wants to talk about Daenarys and her role in the decimation of King's Landing. I want to talk about Drogon and his role up until then. He went from beloved child, very quickly to protector, and vanquisher of evil doers..and then he burned a child to death in Season 4 Episode 10's The Children..and subsequently disappeared (appearing briefly over the ruins of Valyria, mid-season, to a wide eyed Tyrion, and brokenhearted Jorah) until Season 5 Episode 9's appropriately named Dance of Dragons. There we see our future Mad Queen mount our favorite dragon, for the first time. 

Why did he disappear? He was gone before Rhaegal and Viserion were chained in the tombs beneath Mereen, so that wasn't a factor. I have an explanation..guilt. He felt bad. He knew what he had done was wrong. Think about it. He had only killed murderers, tormentors, in defense of his mother. He had never harmed a child. 

Now..fast forward to the events of The Bells..what was asked of him. If this dragon was capable of enough guilt at killing one little girl..imagine the torment at citywide annihilation. I believe that was first conveyed at his initial sighting of Jon coming to the ruins of the Red Keep. Drogon had always conveyed dominance towards Jon. Not this time. That is also why I believe that he allowed Jon to live, following the death of his mother. He knew the act was justified. The Iron Throne truly was what killed her..and her child knew that better than anyone.

TL;DR Drogon felt guilty about burning KL, and, while devastated at the loss, allowed Jon to kill Daenarys, because he knew she had it coming.",gameofthrones

"I wasn’t sure how I would feel about the ending, but I’d figured I’d be happy with it, as I have with every other season, despite losing favorite characters.

From my perspective, I’m having a hard time seeing how Dany got from a place of mercy and being the “breaker of chains” to becoming delusional about the truth of who she had become. It just seemed like such a far jump from the depth and sincerity she had to the blinded-by-power tyrant she had become. 

Although I like the idea of Bran becoming an elected King, and the North remaining free, what about Jon? He is the only one who always did what was right, much like Ned Stark, yet GOT continues to send the message that doing what’s right only leads to punishment. 

I also don’t see how the Unsullied became blind killers as well — especially of innocent women and children. Someone else, loyal to Dany, and other than Jon, could have stood up to her and tried to show her that what she was doing was wrong.  Remind her of things she had said I the past, and of what her father had done.

Anyway, I guess I may be alone here, but it’s just not sitting right with me — especially Jon.",gameofthrones

"A lot of the post that have the [NO SPOILERS] bracket on them actually have spoilers in them, I don’t know of any examples, even if I did I wouldn’t point them out bc that would spoil stuff. But I know a lot of the artwork that people make and then post on here say no spoilers but it’s artwork of characters, either two or more characters together or just a certain character that someone drew. Most of the post that say no spoilers that actually have spoilers (that I can think of right now) are the artwork post. A lot them aren’t spoilers but only for people that have seen most/all of the show. There’s so many that show things/ people that happen later on in the show and would spoil things for people that are just now starting out the show. I mean when I started watching it, around season 3-4 I found out about this sub and started looking at it occasionally. And I started watching the show about 2 weeks before the 8th season started. I caught up to the actual show super fast. I started watching the live episodes on episode 3, so if I started 2 weeks before (which was actually closer to a week before), but my point is that when I started looking at this sub there were a lot of post that said no spoilers they aren’t hidden/ blurred out like the ones that say spoilers, that actually spoiled things for me. It’s like the rule was you only had to put spoilers if it was a major spoiler or if it was obviously a spoiler. Many of them spoiled things for me, like I said before a lot of the artwork were the main things that spoiled things for me. I saw some guy the other day post that he was just starting the series and it made me think about how it he were to look through the sub, there’s a high chance that things would get spoiled even if he didn’t look at any of the [SPOILERS] post, like I did. I did end up looking at some of them just from my own curiosity but if they spoiled something for me, I was okay with it because I knew I was doing it to myself but the ones that said no spoilers and then ended up having a spoiler were the ones that really upset me. Basically if your post says/shows anything that happens in the show it should say [SPOILERS], because a lot of what people doing consider spoilers are spoilers. Does anyone else agree with what I mean? 

TDRL; a lot of the post (mostly artwork) that have the [NO SPOILERS] brackets should have the [SPOILERS] brackets because they end up containing info/pictures of things that happen in the show. A lot of them are things that I guess some people don’t consider spoilers but actually do spoil somethings even if they are small they still spoil some of the story.

"IM NOT HERE TO START ANYTHING, I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE DIDNT LIKE IT. 

I don’t get what made the ending so bad? Everything made sense to me. Dany loses her best friend, has the ability to burn down everything in revenge, and then does it? Like yeah i wish she didn’t, but who could help a person who felt angry and had to make a hard decision to hold back from that? She was grieving, and i’d imagine if you lost someone close to you, you’d be angry too and hurt everything. especially if you had a freaking dragon bro.  It’s in her blood, and she had power go to her head and make her become the villain. 

also why are people upset that Bran became king? like yeah it was sorta stupid when he said “why do you think i came all this way” okay yeah whatever. i heard the H3 Podcast say how “what’s the point of revealing Jon as a Targaryen and him going to the north?” They turned it into a democracy, if that’s the right word, having everyone vote for a king. I feel like the point was to show, “screw whatever house/name you’re from, screw your wealth, your power, all of that. Let’s just choose a wise king that we all agree on rather than let our foolish children be the next one to rule and mess things up” just as Tyrion pointed out. If Jon was king, the Unsullied, Ironborn, and anyone else loyal to Dany would fight against Jon. Creating another war. Jon wanted the killing to stop. Everyone wanted the war to stop, Ser Davos said it himself. He couldn’t be king. They had to find a compromise to bring peace. 

I also hear, “this made everything pointless” well no... Tywin, Cersei, Littlefinger, and everyone else we hate are dead. And the good guys sit at the council, there are no white walkers, and no war. 

I wanted Arya to kill Cersei, but she saw the building collapse who wouldn’t run? The Hound stayed cause he doesn’t care. I wanted Dany to be queen and Jon as king and live happily ever after. but that wouldn’t solve Jamie locked up and Sansa not kneeling. I wanted to see the happy ending.

"So David and Dan have surprisingly been confirmed for the GOT Comic Con panel this year, and I think a lot of people who plan on going and taking part in the Q&amp;A are gonna have some interesting questions for them. However, I fear that if they do not take proactive measures, there is no way any even-slightly-provocative questions will be answered or even asked.

This is D&amp;D we’re talking about. These guys do not handle critisicim well and you can be sure they will do all they can to avoid it. As far as I know they haven’t done a single interview since they started getting shit for Season 8. When the Jaimie-Cersei rape controversy came about they refused to aknowledge the uproar until they were surprised a year later at a Q&amp;A by a female fan, and forced to give a cringeworthy awkward response that completely contradicted what others had said about the scene (they acted like they made it a rape on purpose, when the director and actors have made it clear it was an editing/filming error and the scene was supposed to be portrayed as consensual).

These guys are going to screen questions. I don’t know how Comic Con works. I don’t know if they’ve done it in the past. But they will do it this year. Trust me. So if you get screened before you ask your question, make sure you have a fake overly positive question that appeals to their ego ready to go so they’re more likely to pick you, and then when they do, give em the real thing.",gameofthrones

"There have been tons of instances, specifically during her conquest of slaver’s bay and during season 7 where dany had been extremely impulsive and needed her decisions to be changed by tyrion and others. She did a lot things such as the crucifixion of the slavers and the burning of samwells brother and dad that revealed her violent nature. She also needed tyrion to convince her not to destroy kings landing, which she eventually did anyways.",gameofthrones
"Well, a ""turn"" is not quite the right word, because from my perspective, from season 1, she wasn't quite right in the head.  She never really turned as much as she grew into it. It's who she was. And by season 2, she had evolved to be a person capable of genocide, exemplified by her consideration of doing it, which no sane or truly moral person would ever threaten, let alone consider.

&amp;#x200B;

From that point, she continually battled between doing good things and terrible things in Slavers Bay, Asatapor,  Yunkai and Meereen, also including the Dothraki capital. We just didn't pay much attention to the terrible things because:

A) They were terrible and cruel things done to terrible and cruel people. Who cares, right? The Dexter phenomenon.

B) They were done to red shirts, or characters we cared nothing about, had little to no attachment to or were antagonists or barriers in the way of Dany's goals. We all wanted to see her go to Westeros and take the throne. 

C) We liked Dany, faults and all. We wanted her to succeed. We paid little attention to the terrible things she was doing because of our bias for her and instead often cheered as she smiled while roasting people alive and demanding to hear their suffering and deathly screams and so on ... Hmmm, I think that says a lot about our own morality too, quite frankly.

And I think it's no coincidence that the people who generally did not like Dany, or at least not very much, seemed to have been far more accepting  of her actions in Season 8 Episode 5. Some of these people had even been calling her arc for many years in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

It's only when she comes to Westeros and begins interacting with characters and people we do care about that we start to really question her sanity and specifically by this I mean the general audience at large. 

Then consider that by this time, it's season 7, the show is literally almost over, thus giving the surface impression of a rapid arc that was not developed properly. In actuality, it had been building since season 1, but primarily season 2. 

It's really only on revisiting the series or on reflection of Dany's entire arc that we can begin to appreciate how fleshed out of a hero and villain she really is from the very beginning and as a consequence, begin to have a lot more appreciation for Season 8 Episode 5 and at least the first half of Season 8 Episode 6.",gameofthrones

"A beloved, morally sound and reasonable character turning into a genocidal maniac was never going to work out well however much time you give it, when has that ever happened before in well received fiction or even in real life? The plan sucks as simple as that. 

Danny should have killed some major character(s) like execute Sansa(or try to) for treason and the fans would have changed sides and bought into her being an evil person. Just like everyone started hating Stannis overnight, that was pulled off far better because it was believable evil. Disappointing but believable. 

They literally made her the worst human that ever lived in Westeros, it's completely bonkers and the ratings speak for themselves. All other problems in Season 8 would have been forgiven by the fans just like they didn't penalize season 7 for some of its ludicrousness.

"In seasons 3-5 we see the wildlings as a group consisting of many different people and races. There's people who look like the rest of Westeros, but then we also see things like Thenns, Giants, half-giants(?), Wargs, and the like. We get a sense that the world contains much more than just the regular folks you see in the South. It made it feel like the world GRRM built was filled with little reminders that there's much more than what the people in the South are aware of.

But by season 6, it feels like the only wildlings left are the regular human looking ones (save for Wun Wun). We never see another Then, and there's never another Warg (out of 100k+ people you'd think there'd be more than one) who could maybe have helped in say... Literally any fight that happens from Hardholm onwards.

Just feels like bit by bit D and D stripped the world of the things that made is feel special, unique, and full and they reduced it to a world whose only magical creatures are dragons (and Melisandre I suppose). And then they killed those too.",gameofthrones

Epilogue

Jon opened his eyes. 

It was morning; the cold had woken him, the cold and his dreams. He hated dreaming, his dreams were always the same. He dreamt of fire, of ash, of lost love. He felt cold even though the fire was still crackling in his chimney. As he rose slowly from the bed; he felt something moving next to his bed on the cold floor. Ghost. The snowy white giant direwolf opened one of his red eyes and closed it again as he saw Jon moving from the bed to the privy.

‘It’s no use looking at me that way, Tormund is coming soon and ye better help me this time. We can’t lose to him again’ said Jon.

Ever since he had been exiled back North, to the real North, Tormund and him had an annual hunting competition. The hunt’s champion would be whoever could catch the biggest animal and bring it back to the Free Folk for a feast. The people called it: ‘the Hunt of the Dragonrider and the Giantsbane’. Tormund had won every year since Jon’s exile began seven years ago. This would be the seventh. Two years ago, Jon thought he would win, when Ghost helped him catch the biggest Stag he had ever seen. Tormund caught a grey bear twelve feet tall. Jon lost.

‘Seven years… has it been that long already? Perhaps time should be measured by events and not by years’ Jon thought… He smiled sadly as he remembered moments gone by. He thought of his sisters Sansa and Arya. He thought of Bran, the cripple boy who became King. Mostly he thought of her, he always thought of her. Daenerys.

Jon finished relieving himself, and put on his clothes and wolf-coat. He heard a knock on the door.

‘That will be the Giantsbane’ said Jon to Ghost, as he opened the door.

The giant ginger smiled at the sight of a half awoken Jon. 

‘Are ye ready to lose again little Crow?’ said Tormund.

‘This is the seventh year of the hunt. Seven is a lucky number, like the gods. Mayhaps the gods will smile on me this time’ said Jon.

‘You’re in the North, the old gods rule here my little Crow. Let’s get started Dragonrider, I am already hungry’ said Tormund smiling at his old friend.

Jon picked up his Valyrian sword, Longclaw, his bow and arrows, a leather pouch with dry meat for him and Ghost to share, and some water.  Jon waited at the door as his direwolf slowly got off the floor and came to him. Once outside Tormund smiled and wished his friend good luck.

‘I will see you at sunset Dragonrider’ said Tormund amusedly. 

‘Same to you Tormund of Tarth’ said Jon smiling back at his friend

‘Aaaahhhh good memories’ said Tormund smiling to himself as he walked away from them.

The village was deserted, everybody still asleep as the sun slowly emerged from its daily slumber. Jon and Ghost started walking west towards the nearby forest. Jon had decided to walk around the edge of the forest, on the north side, to spot any animal tracks before deciding to venture into the forest to chase whatever animal might be there. It was a beautiful day Jon thought. The sky was cloudless. Only the vanishing red light from the rising sun disturbed the blueness of the sky. If he looked south he could see the Wall in the horizon. After all these years, the sight of it still took Jon’s breath away. There she was: bright, crying as the first rays of dawn hit her glasslike surface in the summer sun. Eternal.

After an hour or so of walking, they reached the edge of the forest.

‘All right Ghost; let’s see what we can find. Use that nose of yours’ said Jon. The giant direwolf stared at Jon with its big ruby eyes before it started trotting at a slow pace while sniffing the ground in front of him for any animal scents.

Jon was walking briskly behind his direwolf, with his bow and arrow at the ready. The forest to their left looked dark and uninviting, with no signs of animal tracks. They followed the edge of the forest, but ahead of them three hundred yards away, a massive boulder blocked the path. They would either have to go south into the forest or they would have to walk around it on the north side. As they approached the massive rock, Ghost stopped.

‘What is it Ghost? Did you catch a scent?’ Jon quietly asked his wolf.

Ghost lowered its massive body, its left ear pointing backwards, the hair on its back bristled as the wolf started walking slowly towards the rock. Jon followed, bow and arrow ready. They slowly followed the circumference of the rock as they moved northwards around it and away from the forest.  

Jon was about twenty yards away from the edge of the boulder; he would be able to peak on the other side. Ghost started snarling its teeth as Jon reached the edge of the boulder with his bow ready.

‘I’ll shoot it and you hold it down. Then I’ll come running behind you to end it with Longclaw” he whispered to his direwolf.

Jon quickly moved to the other side of the boulder ready to strike…and he froze.

There in front of him, on the other side of the boulder at the edge of the forest resting on the ground was something he hadn’t seen in seven years, and something he thought he would never see again in his life.

A Dragon.

The beast rested on the ground, its black scales as dark as night, massive in its length. It’s long neck bent over its right wing, as if distracted by something on the other side. From where he stood Jon could only see the Dragon’s left profile. Its left wing was half raised, while its long tail rested on the ground by the trees.

Jon could not see the dragon’s face, but he knew who it was. Here at the end of the world, rested the dragon that burnt the Gold Road, the one who brought fire to the Long Night, the dragon that fought its brother in the clouds above Winterfell, the one that had rescued Jon beyond the Wall, the bane of Kings Landing, the one who melted the Iron Throne; and took its dead Mother away in the darkness across the Narrow Sea. The only living dragon left in the world.

Drogon.

Jon stood there watching the magnificent beast, as Ghost remained slightly behind him by the boulder. He lowered his bow and arrow, as he took half a step towards Drogon. His black leather boot was loud in the flat rocky path, and the dragon turned its massive neck around until he found the source of the noise. Jon. 

Drogon stared at Jon, with its mouth and nostrils slightly opened. The dragon’s head was no more than fifty yards away.

Jon stared back at the dragon silently, unsure of what to do. From the corner of his eye, he thought he saw something moving behind the dragon’s left wing. He slowly turned his gaze from the dragon’s eyes to its wing. There, stepping from behind the wing appeared a vision of his past, the reason his heart felt empty and his guilt never-ending. 

Daenerys Targaryen.

Jon’s bow and arrow made a loud noise on the rock as they fell from his hand. He stood there stony and silent, as the statues of the old Kings of Winter in the crypts of Winterfell. He thought it must be a dream, a cruel one. 

‘Dany?’ he muttered silently.

Daenerys smiled softly as she pet Drogon’s wing and started walking towards Jon. She looked as radiant as ever, as if time had stopped by. Her long silver blonde hair moved freely down to her waist. She had a small braid dangling from her forehead to her neck. Her indigo eyes shone as bright as the ice of the Wall in the morning sun. She wore the same white and grey sheep coat that she used to wear when visiting the North.

She stopped three steps away from Jon, as she stared at him with soft eyes and smiled sadly at him. Jon felt those three steps were a greater chasm than crossing the Narrow Sea. He felt his knees buckle under the weight of his aching heart.

‘Da..Dany…how? Jon asked sheepishly

‘The Lord of Light’, she said simply. ‘Drogon took me East. The followers of R’Hllor brought me back, just like you. Now we both have scars in our hearts’.

‘Dany…I’m sorry…I…’ Jon said. He could not say anything else. The words escaped him as they left his mouth. Jon’s eyes reflected the pain and sorrow in his heart, as the tears started forming and gently streaming down his face.

Daenerys took the final steps between them and stood there looking at his old lover’s eyes, as she softly touched his face and wiped the tears away. Jon saw that she was smiling at him as her own tears streamed down her fair cheeks. For the first time in seven years he felt hope, the hope that only love can bring to a man’s heart. 

Jon gently grabbed her hands and stared into her eyes, terrified that this moment would disappear and he would only have a vague memory of it. Terrified it would disappear, like a dream that is forgotten when the body is suddenly awoken.

‘Where have you been all this time?’ Jon said softly.

‘Volantis. That is where I was given the kiss of life. I stayed there for some time, and then went back to the Great Grass Sea’ said Daenerys.

‘Dany…I’m sorry’ said Jon. He wanted to say so much more to her, but the words betrayed him.

‘I know you are. I had many enemies in my first life, but I did not think I would die at the hands of the noblest man I knew. The man I loved’ she said with some pain in her voice.

‘At first, I wanted to come back with Fire and Blood once again. However, having life again changed me…with time, I understood your choice’ she said.

‘I should have tried to convince you some other way…I…’ Jon said. 

Daenerys gently squeezed his hands. ‘You were right, and so was Varys. I lost my way on my path to the Iron Throne. I became what I always struggled to keep at bay. I became my father’s daughter’ Daenerys said regretfully.

‘Life was given back to me, and I had…other things to mind…so I went back to the Dothraki Sea, away from the world’ she said with a smile on her face.

Even with his eyes full of tears as he stared at Daenerys, Jon caught a slight movement from the corner of his eyes. He saw as Drogon’s gargantuan head turned around to its right, as something appeared from behind its right wing. It was the most beautiful sight that Jon had ever seen in his life. 

A little girl.

The little girl could not have been older than six years old, Jon thought. She started walking slowly towards Daenerys and Jon. She had fair skin and her eyes were a brighter shade of indigo than Daenerys. She had two silver hair braids on each side of her face down to her neck. ‘Targaryen hair’ Jon thought. 

As she approached them, he noticed that her hair in the middle was not silver, but black and wavy. His heart started racing, as if it was trying to tell him something about this most beautiful of creatures.

The little girl wore a sheep coat, half black and half red with a grey silver band across the middle. This is what Jon thought Daenerys must have looked like when she was that age, except for the patch of black hair. Jon had no doubt this girl was Daenerys Targaryen’s daughter. He noticed that she was holding a wooden figurine, a toy of some sort. It was a wooden dragon, painted sky blue except for its dark green tail. She stopped about five yards from them.

Daenerys let go of Jon’s hands and approached her daughter. She grabbed her hand and brought her closer to Jon, no more than one foot away.

‘This is your father my love. He was a King, and his name is Aegon Targaryen, the sixth of his name” Daenerys said looking at his daughter.

Daenerys looked happily at Jon and said: ‘this is your daughter. Her name is Lyanna Targaryen’

Jon’s legs gave out and he fell on his knees in front of his daughter. Ghost approached Jon as it saw him falling on his knees.

Jon looked at Lyanna with all the love a man can have for his child, and with all the pain that his heart had carried for seven long years.

‘How?...Dany, how?... Jon’s words were barely audible.

‘Only death can pay for life. My life allowed her to live’ Daenerys said sweetly as a tear slowly fell down her face.

Jon hugged and kissed his daughter with tears in his eyes and joy in his heart. He held her with more love than he had ever given to anyone, more than Arya, more than Daenerys, more than Ghost. He did not know how long that moment lasted, in that instant he felt immortal. 

At last he let go of Lyanna.

‘Lyanna… that’s a beautiful name’ said Jon smiling at his daughter.

‘Mother named me after my grandmother. She said she had great beauty and was very brave’ the girl said with conviction.

‘She was just like you’ said Jon approvingly

Ghost got closer to the little girl, who seemed a bit scared of the giant direwolf. Ghost then smelled the patch of black hair and started licking her ear. Lyanna giggled as she started petting the wolf’s only ear.

‘What’s his name?’ Lyanna asked curiously

‘His name is Ghost. I’ve had him since he was a pup. I think he likes you’ Jon said. Jon gently grabbed Lyanna’s wooden dragon and started examining it.

‘I like your toy dragon, does he have a name?’ he asked 

‘He protects the smaller dragons, so I named him Jorax after Mother’s bravest Knight’ said Lyanna as Daenerys smiled at her daughter and Jon.

A sad smile crossed Jon’s mouth, as he remembered House Mormont. ‘Your mother is right, he was brave, gallant and honorable. What every Knight should be. He saved our lives’ Jon said.

Jon then pulled some of the dry meat from his leather pouch and offered it to Lyanna so she could feed Ghost.

Lyanna started feeding Ghost and playfully petting the direwolf. Drogon sneered and turned its head away from the little girl and her new friend.

Jon stood once again and saw that Daenerys was beaming at him. The dawn had given way to the sun, the sky was blue and cloudless, and the Wall shined as bright as ever in the horizon. Jon thought this was the most perfect moment of his life. He grabbed Dany’s face and kissed her. He did not know how long he kissed her.

‘Mother, father, they’ve found us. They did follow us’ said Lyanna with excitement.

Jon’s soldier instincts made him turn around quickly looking for an enemy. It was then when Drogon got up from his rest, raised his head to the sky and roared louder than Jon had ever heard or remembered.

Jon’s hand went for Longclaw as he scanned the surrounding area. Before he could unsheathe his sword, Daenerys hand calmly grabbed him by the wrist. She quietly pointed up, to the morning sky.

Jon raised his head and saw what Lyanna had seen. Approaching the clearing were they stood, Jon saw one more magnificent sight in this most humbling of days.

Dragons.

He counted six dragons led by a sky blue one with a dark green tail. They were all of various sizes, all smaller than Drogon. The dragons started landing in the clearing next to Drogon.

‘They made it mother, they’re here’ said Lyanna with the innocence and wonder than only a child has.

Daenerys smiled at her daughter and looking at Jon said ‘they are here, just like us. Home’

Is there a specific order I could watch the show in that could make for a unique/confusing experience?,gameofthrones
"I am curious about this, considering people like Brienne. Yes, Brienne is from the stormlands and she was taught she was an ugly thing by her septa (and in the book she looks like a man and isn’t just tall and buff) but at the same time her father taught her swordplay as “you shouldn’t tussle with boys but I’ll be sure you’re doing it right”. Meanwhile, the north is more liberal towards women in combat: in the book all the mormont girls are warriors, with Dacey Mormont being Robb Stark’s bodyguard. And because the north is cold and unforgiving, many women are ruling over lands, like Lady Hornwood. If Brienne was born in the north, yeah she’d be made fun of for looking like a man but be applauded for being a warrior. 

This also goes hand in hand with the books since it deconstructs the tomboy doesn’t want to have tea parties and wear makeup trope: yeah it sucked for Arya to be a lady but at the same time she had three square meals and a roof over her head whereas now she’s a 9 year old girl losing her sanity, murdering people, and running for her life. She even thinks that if she had to go back to lady lessons she would take it. And as a lady the only things she was good at were math and horseback riding, which she eclipsed Sansa in. 

So sorry about that but my question is:

How would Arya’s upbringing changed if Catelyn wasn’t a Tully but rather perhaps (I’m just randomly giving house names) a Bolton or a Manderly? Would Catelyn have still been a lady, considering we have people like Lady Dustin? Would she have been more accepting of Arya but still taught her a compromise? 

I am curious because in the books, Ned doesn’t think Arya liking swords is anything more than a kiddy phase, like karate: you saw a commercial about it and three months later you’re bored. Granted, Lyanna was an athletic, beautiful tomboy who loved all kinds of martial prowesses. So would Ned become like Catelyn and try to make Arya something she isn’t? Or would he take more of an interest in Sansa who has no interest in doing stupid things like learning how to start a campfire or shoot a bow? 

Would Sansa have been the Arya Horseface in this scenario and hated living in the North a heck of a lot more and not just in a teen sense? After all, how does being good at knitting compare to knocking a boy’s teeth out? Yeah she’s a beauty but still, she’s no Arya.

" **This is gonna be a long one so please bare with me.**

**Most people wonder why Dany burned everything on site instead of only the Redkeep. And to be fair that's probably the first thought that came to everyone's mind when she looked at the Redkeep with all that hate, most people thought the Redkeep is gone, instead she burned everything.**

**A lot of people see it as a plot hole or that it hasn't been built up to enough but I have to respectfully disagree, and here's why.**

**Dany always felt like Westeros was her home and its people are her people. But she NEVER felt at home in Westeros except for when she first landed on Dragonstone. Every experience she had since landing has not made it easier for her. Those who declared for her didn't agree with her and then fell very quickly. Even after saving Winterfel and the world she felt like she was admired the least, or at least still looked at as a stranger. But worst of all, she lost more trusted and loved advisors and friends in Westeros than she had in her entire life across the narrow sea. And that's both in the past and the present. The scene between Grey Worm and Messandei where they felt like strangers and they will never be treated as one of them, Dany might not have said it exactly - as being loved is different than being seen as a foreigner - but she's been feeling the same way for a while. Starting with Randall Tarly then Sansa Stark and then basically in every gathering that happened in Winterfel.**

**The one person left to her from Westeros was Jon and then the news about his birth tainted it and him refusing to keep it from his family and then the secret getting out ruined it furthermore. But what truly devastated her was his repeated rejection. He was the last thing left to her from all of Westeros especially with Tyrion failing her repeatedly. But even then destroying Kingslanding wasn't as probable to happen if it weren't for Messandei's murder, because to her it was the last straw that filled her heart with hate towards all of Westeros. What happened next only sealed The fate of the Kingslanders even more. With the secret out and Varys betraying her and conspiring to kill her and being told by Tyrion and then Jon rejecting her again and that's a very important point. When she tried sleeping with him again even after telling him that she doesn't feel loved in Westeros, it was as if she was saying I would settle for your love instead of theirs. But he rejected her again, and that I think was as bad to her as losing Messandei. He's the first she truly loved since Drogo and she has never experienced rejection before, which can't be disregarded not only because it's happening to a strong woman and a queen but also because it's piling on the both open and hidden rejection of all of Westeros sealing its fate.**

**Some might say that all of this was too subtle, but you forget that the show always liked a little bit of surprise in big events so it was actually the right amount of subtlety.**

**And for all of that it can be said - or that's at least my humble opinion - that if either G.R.R Martin or David Benioff and D.B. Wiess have opted for a happy ending I imagine the best one was that after a few confrontaions and situations between Dany and varios westerosy Lords followed by conversations with Tyrion, Varys, Grey Worm, Messandie and Jon snow that Dany would've accepted that she belonged with the people she freed and lived more amongst. And after she and Jon conquered Kingslanding together and putting him on the Iron Throne as Agon Targaryen starting a new historic era in which targaryens ruled all the known world on both sides of the Narrow Sea. but for that to be even slightly possible at least one of Jora Mormont or Messandie had to survive.**

**The only things that disappointed me in the final season are three small issues.**

**First: Not seeing an introduction from Jon between Dany and Ghost. I know it might seem like nothing but it was something I was actually waiting for and I don't think I was alone in this. How he would react to her? would his treatment to her give him a small clue that she's related to him? how he fares when getting close to the dragon? I get they wanted the focus in graphics on more significant events but the way I see it is when you are finishing something that big and postponed for more than a year in airing then you should go all out in everything big or small.**

**Second: we should've seen at least two or three scenes between Dany and Arya other than nothing at all. I know they are two characters that had nothing connecting them throughout the show or the series, but any conversation between those two would've been something to witness, especially if one of those was a daring confrontation after the burning of Kingslanding.**

**Third: ( and a lot more disappointing ) Dany's death scene. It was handled a little poorly. The conversation was short, Jon should have argued more that that. And I don't know why but Dany not saying anything before dying didn't sit well with me.

"I was thinking about what a genius Ramin Djawadi is recently and I had a question for the music experts out there.

Most of us loved ""Jenny of Oldstones,"" whether the Pod version or the F+TM version.

Obviously, things didn't go that direction.

My question is: was the song's melody only used twice: the first time when Pod sang it, and then during the credits with Florence singing it?

I ask because it seems like, regardless of my own interpretation of it being wrong, it still should hold some king of significance/meaning for the story and--if it does--it might resurface again. But on all my listens of the soundtrack and rewatches, I don't recall ever hearing it again. I thought I had it in the throne room scene in episode six, but alas--I think it might've just been ""Truth."" This seems like a missed opportunity if they dropped it after episode two. It's a gorgeous melody.

"Well, I think it goes without saying that the ending was not spectacular. Since I couldn’t just accept that my favorite show ended in such lame fashion, I decided to make an ending of my own.... gotta say, I think I did a better job than D&amp;D lol

Everything goes the same (except Rhegal is not inexplicably sniped from impossible angles out of the blue) until the battle at King’s Landing. The battle begins much the same way, except to make it feel a bit more tense and not one sided this is when Rhegal gets taken down. 

While Danny takes out the ballistas Jamie manages to make his way into the keep with Cersei. Prior to this she was seen whispering with Qyburn about some plan. After Jamie arrives they cut back to the battle. 

Danny’s army storms the city and easily defeats Cersei’s forces. However, this time instead of inexplicably leveling the whole city when the bells ring Dany flies over to the keep to kill Cersei herself. At the same time Arya and the hound arrive at the keep to find the Mountain guarding the door to Cersei’s chamber. The Hound battles him allowing Arya to get past. She walks in just as Danny arrives. They give each other a quick “what are you doing here?!” glance before turning their attention to Cersei who is sitting with her back to them. As Danny begins ranting Cersei remains silent with her back to them. Arya gets the feeling something is off and quickly rushes over to Cersei and turns her around. Both Arya and Danny a frozen in shock when they realize the women is not Cersei, but the Shame Nun, who Cersei had practically turned into her own personal Reek. As the realization of what had just happened sets in a rumbling is heard getting louder, and louder until it erupts into a bang as green flames engulf the entire city. 

The camera cuts to Cersei and a horrified Jamie on a boat making their way out to sea. Jamie, horrified at what he had just seen draws his sword and appears to be about to kill Cersei, but can’t bring himself to do it. 

The camera cuts back to an injured Dany kneeling in the rubble next to whatever is left of the iron throne. Despite finally having what she had always wanted (the throne) she is clearly distraught, a feeling that intensifies as the realization sets in that she is the lone survivor, and queen of nothing but the ashes.",gameofthrones
"I really liked Daenerys at first, justifying her acts of cruelty as anger issues and turning a blind eye to her ""the end justifies the means"" mentality. To make an omelet you need to break a few eggs. But I could no longer do it when she continued burning down Kings Landing. I could not understand how the character I had loved could be capable of sustained cruelty. Momentary cruelty yes, but this was too much, I thought. But then I tried to really understand the character and put myself on her dragons, so to speak. Here is my best try:

The shame of her being the daughter of a madman and being exiled away from her home is too painful for her to feel. She, understandably, could not accept the shame that she was inherently broken. This makes her vulnerable to creating an ideal false self: a queen destined to free the people and stop the wheel of power that crushes all the poor people underneath as it rolls. She has a grand, noble purpose and the god-like power of destiny on her side. She believed that false self so much so that she walked into a fire. Who does that? She was lucky, but she only found out because she's goddamn mental. Can you imagine Jon Sno walking into a fire? He'd be peeing himself. And then Daenerys decides to ride a dragon. Again, who does that? Hasn't she heard you can raise a wolf puppy but when they grow up they gonna maul you? What do you think it's like for fucking dragons? She's always been mental, but she has also always been lucky. She reminds the people of her greatness and virtue, but she's really reminding Herself. She is a Targaryen after all, and that comes with connotations of insanity. That shame needs to be pushed down whenever it flares up.

Betrayal makes that shame flare up because why would anyone betray the breaker of chains, the legendary mother of dragons destined to sit on the iron throne? Only if they don't believe her story, which means they must have a reason for not believing her story, which means she starts to doubt herself too. If others don't believe her story, should she? That brings her back to that unbearable feeling that she is inherently broken. The shame must be pushed back down. The false self becomes her identity, and she must protect that persona because only empty despair and pain lay on the other side. Who is she if she is not the mother of dragons sitting upon the iron throne? When we invest ourselves in a false self, we do so at the expense of developing our true selves. When the false self finally crumbles, only an empty scaffolding remains.

Daenerys fell when the 3-eyed raven spilled the beans about Jon Sno being a Targaryen, which we assume is true. This was the moment Tyrion Lannister and Varys realize there is another option for the throne. Up to now, there was only one option, so why waste time scrutinizing it? But now they must compare, and that saying about the mental state of a Targerian being a coin toss at birth comes into play. Being betrayed by Varys means he saw through her false self and into the inherently broken Daenerys she is so desperately scared of feeling. If he saw through her, she might also catch a painful glimpse. It's hard to deny a truth everyone around you accepts. She had to prevent that, so she displaces her shame onto Varys. Varys now personifies her true self and he must disappear never to be seen again, not even his corpse. But others had seen Varys, especially Tyrion. Despite giving Tyrion his last chance, she no longer trusts him, but she denies that she has once again been betrayed; Tyrion has probably just lost his edge. However, by freeing his brother, Tyrion gives the mercy that Daenerys couldn't. That means she is the callous one in comparison. It also means he fears her because he did not try to convince her to free him. That is too close to what people thought of Daenerys' father. What is a mad king if not a callous person people fear? Tyrion has also seen through Daenerys' false self, but he cannot accept this because it goes against his own pride of being intelligent. It also means more war. He denies this until it becomes too hard to deny. Daenerys and Tyrion no longer trust each other, but neither can accept that truth.

Tyrion told her the city bells will ring when it surrenders. Daenerys now has a choice: believe Tyrion, which means Tyrion was right to free his brother and fear her as a callous woman; or label Tyrion a betrayer, in which case this means the bell-ringing is a ruse and she must attack, justifying such an atrocity by claiming Cersei used her people as a shield. Believing Tyrion means feeling once more that unbearable pain that she is defective, a pain she all too recently felt due to Varys' betrayal. Not believing Tyrion means accepting he betrayed her, which then also brings those unbearable feelings. She had to make a choice when bells tolled for her, but there was no way out; that unbearable shame was coming and she had to defend herself from herself. She chose to mistrust Tyrion so the resulting anger and hatred could keep her false self together. Think about it, anger is often one of the first stages of grief people go through because it helps us keep it together as some sort of psychic glue when the truth is too hard to bear. We can't break down into desperation when we are angry and full of hatred. Daenerys wants to break the wheel once and for all and justifies her wrath to herself by claiming Cersei used her people as a shield. She believes that end justifies the means of burning the city to the ground and the anger and hatred launch her to action. But when she starts and hears the children screaming and fleeing it's harder to deny that she is mad. The shame keeps pushing through stronger and stronger, the cracks in her false self keep spreading and she gets angrier and more full of hatred to keep her false self together. She is not thinking about the people because she is too focused on the battle going on inside her head. 

Eventually, there is nobody left to kill and nothing left to destroy. The vicious circle stops and she can calm down. She cannot look at the damage she has caused because that is like looking into her true self. It is too painful and there is nothing left to hate and be angry at. But at least it's in the past; now the true reign of peace can start. War is war, she used them as a shield, they left me no choice, it had to be done, etc. She chooses to narrowly focus on the symbol of her false self: the iron throne. So narrowly that she seems to not notice the destroyed building where it stands.

Jon Sno was the only person to truly love her without idolizing her. When Jon Sno kills her, she suddenly realizes who she thought believed her false self enough to love her now sees her true self clearly. When he stabs her, her false self crumbles. She may be able to trick herself into believing that her mind is not broken, but she can't deny a body broken by a dagger. What is left behind is the scaffolding of her true self. Her expression as she dies is one of empty desperation, a person who died without ever truly living. Jon Sno sees this emptiness. He is not sure if he did the right thing because he only met the true Daenerys once the dagger went in, and all he saw was that empty fragile scaffolding. So little was there that it was hard to tell when she was gone, almost needing the blood coming out of her mouth and nose to confirm she was no longer there. She became a stranger.

Drogon sees her mother dead, but he is no closer to meeting her real self than when she was alive. Now there is no hope of ever doing so. It was not Jon Sno who killed her, it was the delusion of grandeur; the idealized false self Daenerys desperately created to escape the pain of feeling she was inherently broken. The throne had to go not because the dragon was somehow wise about the history of men fighting senseless wars for momentary power upon that throne, but because it represented Daenerys' false self, with her true self symbolized by her broken body. Or maybe the dragon was like ""If she can't have it, nobody can"". I can't really get into the mind of a dragon to be totally honest.

Daenerys never sat on the iron throne because deep inside she knew she was not who she said she was. Not really. She touched the symbol of what she thought she was, but she could not get in touch with what she really was: broken.",gameofthrones
"Note: Right after I posted this I noticed some errors, and after I edited them I did something that uncovered the spoilers bars.  I changed it back within seconds, but if anyone somehow saw anything they shouldn’t have (I think that’s why I have the bot comment) then I sincerely apologize. 


1. Question: &gt;!Who’s the warden of the Westerlands now?? We’ve got Bronne in the Reach (which I have mixed feelings about but good enough), the most wholesome Baratheon in history at Storms End, the lovable idiot brother of Cat in the Riverlands, #1 sister Yara in the Iron islands, a random back-up Martell cousin in Dorne, the spoiled kid in the vale (surprised the show never wrote its way to a replacement), the Queen in the North (Hell yeah), and Bran in King’s landing...so is anyone doing anything anymore in the Westerlands or are all the minor lords still celebrating the end of the Lannisters?  I like to think they gave it to Tyrion, and he just kept the Lannister name and symbol but just turned the image around for the better.  He could definitely father children, and I honestly think it would be cool to have a house in the future known for such a large number of them being dwarves (and yes, children of parents with achondroplasia have close to a 50/50 chance,1/4 if one parent, of being born with it as well), showing their lineage to such an awesome guy and the  savior to their house.  Also as a great generations-lasting middle finger to Tywin and Cersei.  Either that or I considered Podrick with house Payne but he seems happy enough in the kingsguard.!&lt;

2.  Comment:  &gt;!Despite so many people being disappointed with the ending (and I have my issues with it) I”m overall pretty happy with it.  Mainly the lord-elected system for king.  I like the house lines lasting within the lordships, but I also think it’s a good idea to have a central government keeping among the different kingdoms (except for the north, the Starks are cool) but one that doesn’t inherit it, so there won’t be any disputes over birth right.  I’m obviously not vouching for that kind of monarchical/aristocratic/etc in real life *beats chest in American* but it works for that world, or at least at that worlds place in time...also house sigils and thrones are really cool (that’s what kept drawing me back to this show in the first place).  And yes...Bran has zero personality left which makes him hard to follow him as a character anymore, but kind of like what Tyrion said, that’s kind of a good thing, also someone who knows all of the 100% truthful history and bits of the present?? Sounds like quite the problem solver.  Also he’s a Stark, and, like I said, Starks are pretty awesome.  I will say I am disappointed with Jon’s (I’m not calling him Aegon...) ending, it is a little touching and poetic for him to be back at the wall...but I just feel like he belongs doing so much more.  I love that Sansa is Queen in the North, but maybe Bran could change the law and Jon could be like a part-time/on and off nights watch guy? Maybe do some traveling with Arya? I also love that they have her sailing west, and I hope there’s some future content maybe about whatever she finds (we all know she has to find something...) and like an update on Westeros as well (don’t shoot, I haven’t read the books, and I’m sure they’re great but I don’t really plan to).!&lt;

3.  Minor/not very plot-important Question: &gt;!Where the hell is Meera Reed? She just kind of dipped after dropping Bran off at Winterfell.  She’d probably die (not enough main character plot armor) and I’m glad she didn’t, but I’m surprised she and her father’s house didn’t (well maybe some did that weren’t shown) help defend Winterfell against the white walkers.!&lt;

4. Another minor question: &gt;!What are they going to do with Dragonstone?  It would kind of such to let such an awesome castle go to waste.  To be honest with King’s Landing so heavily destroyed I thought that would be come the new seat of power.  I guess they could just give it to some trusted lord in the crownlands, I just can’t think of anyone.!&lt;

5. MAJOR/very important Comment: &gt;!Hot pie should have been made head chef/cook of the red keep, or given a minor lordship, or a little gold... something!  He was an ass in the beginning but then ended up being an awesome guy who makes large, medieval-versioned animal crackers for his friends when he sees them off.  And he played a huge role in”Winterhell’s” fate, he told Arya that Jon defeated the Boltons...without that she might’ve never made it up there in time for the Great War...and who would’ve been there to kill the damn night king?!  The realms of men might just owe Hot Pie as much as they do Arya, or I maybe someone else would’ve told her soon after, but still, he was a loyal friend with valuable culinary skills.  Not a lot of those around in Westeros.!&lt;

Alright I thought I was going to have more questions but I answered most of them myself in the meantime.  And most of this is just for discussion and hearing other fan theories, I’m sure most of it is just unwritten so there are no answers for it.  But the &gt;!Westerlands!&lt; thing is really killing me, once I latch onto a story I get kind of finicky.",gameofthrones

"Hello Samwell, the last of the Tarly’s,  
Acolyte of Citedial.

I read you’re latest volumes, in the series of Ice and Fire. It was interesting. It’s amusing to see history distorting itself. No one means to lie... but the truth is never what gets told.

I felt compelled to write this. Just one record of the truth. Partially for my sanity, and partially to see if anyone ever finds it. Ever reads it. Ever believes.

While your volume seven and eight and rife with inaccuracies, I wish to focus on one for now; he one you call the Mad Queen. The beautiful Daenerys Targaryen.

Was she mad?  
It may be justifiable to call her that.  
But she wasn’t rash. Or impulsive. Or cruel.  
Not by intention. Although some may justifiably perceive that way.  

She simply saw a horrible truth, and did what she thought was right. But let’s start at the beginning.

...

Daenerys was a young girl. And knew little of ways of war. But no one knew when it came to Obsidian.

It’s almost like it’s named to be insidious.

Dragon glass was how she knew it. And what could be frightening about dragon glass to the Dragon Queen? All she could notice was beautiful it was. The way it grabbed the light. The way that if you stared at it long enough, it seemed to melting.

“Glass can’t move” she mused to herself, as she sat within her cave, deep below earth. She was home, finally. And she powerful, finally. And she was ready to do what she needed to do, finally. What was there to fear? Really.

And so that dainty young girl ran delicate fingers across the glass; just to feel that it solid.

She was annoyed when she pricked herself. When a shard of glass found her way between her nail and skin. A thin piece had lodged itself deep inside her.

It didn’t bleed, but it hurt. It was an irritating pain. Pulsing. She tried to forget it, she tried to get on with duties, but the pain that wouldn’t go away.

I’m sure you are familiar with Greyscale. The stone illness that slowly consumes a man, and turns him into little more than an animated rock. Well dragon glass has a similar effect, it turns you into the animated, walking, sometimes even living dead. You stop growing, you stop consuming resources, and eventually you start to die.

It’s a rare illness. But even rarer is the blood of the dragon. Fire made flesh can fight the cold grasp of death. And that’s what happened. The illness ravaged her, but couldn't consume her fully. She stopped growing, but never decayed. She died, but still lived. And something the living will never know, is how much things change when you’re dead.

Her perspective grew, and the world around her shrank.
Time began to dilate; she could watch a single snowflake drop for hours.
And she began to hear the spirits.
The voices of the dead. All of the dead. Including the self-crowned king of the dead, known only now as the The Night King.

He whispered to her. He gently guided her to cruel unyielding truths. Everything she ever worked for was in vain. Every dream, was a pipe dream. The truth started soft but grew. It rang in her mind like deafened bell, reverberating off her skull, being driven by the glass in her finger.

Everyone was a slave.  
Everyone would always be a slave.  
Your life was decided by when and where you were born,  
More than decision you could ever make,  
And nothing,  
Nothing she could do would change that.  

She listened.  
To the land.  
To people.  
She felt all the suffering of the living.  
The hunger, the grief.  
Everyone was trapped.  

At least while they were living.

...

And you see dear Sam, this is why The Queen of Ice and Fire did what she did. She wished to free people, to truly free them. And it worked. They still hail her the breaker of chains. Families live in peace and freedom.

I don’t expect you to understand Sam. You are of the living, you could never quite grasp it. But please keep this letter. It’s important the living world at least have one true recollection of her. Even if it’s not read for a thousand thousand years.

Maybe the difference is that I didn't have to wait 9 years for the finish.  Or maybe it's because I didn't read the books and many who did had real problems.  

Bran - good choice for king; he's literally seen it all and will be a benevolent monarch; he is the exact opposite of Jofffrey or King Robert plus there is now a Stark running the north in Winterfell, the 6 kingdoms and beyond the wall. Looks like they are set up for Stark-peace for a long while.

Dany - nothing about her turn to the dark side was surprising; many times throughout the series her first impulse was to burn it all down. In the end when she was alone she was true to her nature.  She flew too close to the sun and got burned - ironic. 

Jon Snow - coin flipped opposite of Dany.  He consistently did the right thing in his eyes including shiving Dany. Retiring beyond the wall was a good ending for him and what he deserved. 

Tyrion - he faded out as the seasons went by; probably most disappointed in his character arc over time.  He lost his joi de vivre and got boring - too many lectures.

"Which “Game of Thrones” character is the most relatable to your life story, and demeanor?

&amp;#x200B;

I think GRRM is a great writer since he wrote such true, and complex characters that resonate with people. I’d love to know how it applies to you as a person since I feel that GRRM was really writing about our ‘modern society’ but just based it in fantasy and medieval times.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, I used to think I was “John Snow” and “Jamie Lannister” but as I learned and read more… I was really “Jamie Lannister”(with some “Jon Snow” thrown in there). I was a guy that was shunned early in life (5-7th grade) since I moved to a real trash, white trash, racist, evil school, and I became friends with “Whoever would have me” and I ended up with degenerates, or was considered a ‘bad kid’ due to the crowd I ran with. This went on  into middle school, even though everyone hated my group of friends (Stoners, bad kids, degenerates, etc..) I didn’t care since they were “loyal” to me (or so I thought). So I got a bad ‘reputation’ when I didn’t even do drugs, I just rolled with them.

&amp;#x200B;

Then high school, I became a popular guy, talented at sports, etc… but people would claim or see me as a ‘good guy’ but, I was always seen as ‘scum” for being friends with those people from before. I’ve had people throughout my life give tales of me, my ways, my ‘honor’ etc… and those that knew me would be shocked since they saw how “noble” and good I was (sort of like Jamie Lannister). Though I did something wrong, I always tried to do what was “right” while keeping my loyalties. As I grew older into college and beyond, I’ve dealt with that. People talking bad of me, thinking I was arrogant or cocky (Some of that was in there), but I ultimately good, so when things did go awry, people would and have stood up for me and my character like Brienne and Tyrion did for Jamie. So I relate to him the most.

I’m a bit Jon Snow, but mainly the part about “Getting along” with everyone. I can befriend anyone. Regardless of race, religion, creed, country… I make it a point to be friendly, and help if I can, and keep my word. That’s how I'd like them.

So which characters do you think you are? Which characters encompass your personality or do you see yourself as, and why? ( I think it’s just an interesting and fun question, and I’d love to know. As my friends and I always have these fun talks about this when it comes to this story.)",gameofthrones

Hi everyone,

I need to rant a bit! All names and some details changed for anonymity's sake.

**Previously;**

I previously posted here about my relationship with my aunt Dana - short version: I found out that my gf Dana is my aunt and I am actually the owner of the company Dana has been wanting her whole life. My sisters Samantha and Anna have been bitching against Dana from the start (Samantha even wanted to not feed Dana's pets) and my brother Bo is always stoned and thinks that he is a raven. I signed over my claim to parts of the company to Dana and then everyone was pissed and on top of that we had to deal with the creditors (strange ones, blue-eyes, white skins, seems to multiply almost like zombies).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/be0781/spoilers\_need\_relationship\_advice\_everyone\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/be0781/spoilers_need_relationship_advice_everyone_is/)

**Update on the situation:**

So, the creditors arrived and attacked the firewalls of our company. We were not the best tacticians, I have to admit, we basically sent out the entire cavalry to get killed. I am not really sure what the plan was or who even came up with said plan. Someone screwed up. Wasn't me, and I don't think that it was James or Tyrs - they are all good tacticians and have seen battle, like I have. Someone screwed up, but I am really not sure who. Only that it wasn't me, cos that plan was stupid.

Anyways, we defeated our main creditor by luring him to Bo, who was sitting around, stoned as always \*yes, that part did not make sense to me as well, I just rolled with it, as did everyone else, but for some reason our main creditor wanted my stoned brother\* and then Anna worked out some anger management issues and subverted the expectation everyone had that either Dana or I would take down our biggest creditor. Yay. It really felt anticlimatic. It felt like Dana and I had been built up to be that next big thing, but then squirrel-Anna could take our main creditor down. Yay. I mean, I even had a stare-down duel with him once and Dana had some beautiful exotic pets who could breathe fire and everyone was like really, really exited ... anyway...

Anticlimatic, right? Anyway, we still had to deal with the competitor sitting at the helm of Dana's father's old company. Let's call her Cerna. So, we had James and Tyrs, her brothers, although they have not been really helpful. James apparently has been fucking her, but he has also been fucking my sister's bodyguard Brienna, so who really knows these days and Tyrs is still dealing from a head wound and insists that ""she is not a monster, she is a mother."" All evidence to the contrary. Tyrs is not as smart as he once was. Apparently he suffers from ""adaption problem"", whatever that means.

BTW, I am not shaming Tyrs! I also had some health problems - I suffered from a speech impediment and could only say ""my Queen"" and ""I don't want it."" with hilarious results. Not.

Anyways, Dana was pissed that I could challenge her claim to being CO, and Tyrs and Vars and Samantha and Bo and ... everyone actually, were really not helping. Samantha was antagonizing her, but that's her default modus now. Vars and Tyrs kept insisting that ""I would be a good CO of the company"".... and then Dana found out and had her pet barbecue Vars. Don't blame her! She was already going through a lot at that time: the second of her three pets had been shot down by our competitor (the pet had eye vision problems and could not see a very large fleet below him, I always told them that they should take him to the optician!), her best friend had been killed by Cerna, and Vars speaking against her after she had been listening to everything he said - well - I mean - I don't know. I still had speech impediment problems then, and she was ""maaah queeen."" I hope that you understand.

Ok, then, finally the big battle. Dana easily defeats everyone with her remaining last pet, which kinda had me wondering why she did not do this in the beginning ... anyways, she then started killing everyone, because she heard bells? (don't ask me, I am still not quite sure what happened) and Cerna and James died together as they kissed each other under the only part in the cellar of the castle that was destroyed. I mean, I know that james has not the brightest, but really if they had just moved two feet ---Then Dana was the CO of the Company and I killed her. I mean, I had to - it was in the script! And her pet melted the symbol of our company and then took off with her. I am actually not entirely sure what happened, I am still behind on the plot development. I only hope that no one is disappointed. I can't emphasize this enough.

After Dana's death, there was a discussion who would take over the company. Nobody thought of me , even though I had the best claim, and Grewm, one of Dana's managers, was raising a fuss about me having murdered her. He still commands an army (kinda strange, the number of men in that army kept fluctuating, but we all thought it best just to roll with it and not make a fuss, because it seemed awfully convenient).

Then, Samantha and Bo arrived; a council was convened and all said that Bo had the best story line and that he should be CO of the company. Everyone agreed, I was sentenced to Exile (What The Fuck?) in the non-company lands (North) to appease Grewm. My sister Samantha declared that she would have one part of the company and become independent. (Later, some other managers from The Maritime and Desert Section asked me if that had been an option,cos if so, they would like to change their votes and also become independent. At this point, I must admit I was pretty pissed and told them to f\*ck off and took the first ship out. I saw Grewm leaving on another ship, so I am not even sure what the exile thing was about .... The entire thing is fucked up and Bo can deal with it.)

**Now:**

When I came to the North, the first thing that happened was that my pet Ghost, my good old doggo, bit me, when he saw me, and my old friend Torsten - upon learning that James had died - relocated back to HQ and Bo, muttering something about ""fat chance"" and ""try my luck"". No idea why. But he seemed in an awful hurry and was whistling the entire time.

**Finally:**

I am not sure why I post here, but I would just like to get it of my chest - the company is now in the hands of my stoned brother Bo, Ghost is ignoring me (seemed to be pissed at me), my sister is apparently on a one-woman rampage in her own company, everybody seems to have won and I have frost bite on my butt.

I think I just need a hug - it just feels like my entire life has been building towards some glorious goal (hell, I was even raised from the dead) and now I am sitting here alone with only a pissed off pet to keep me company.

Anyone understand my pain?",gameofthrones

"What did people think of Arya’s ending?

She has always been one of my favourite characters but I could never really imagine a satisfying ending for her. 

The show ending didn’t work for me because I couldn’t see her leaving her family like that after all they went through and all the ‘lone wolf dies but the pack survives’ stuff. But I also can’t see her being content to live in Winterfell with Sansa  or anywhere just being idle. 

I honestly kinda would like her to die protecting Jon and Sansa in some way.

What would have been a preferable fate for her?",gameofthrones
"It seems like every great house goes extinct simply because half a dozen or so members die, but that makes no sense considering how long they have been around. The houses themselves are tiny too - apparently with Mace, Loras and Margery dead Olenna's the only one left. Nobody in the last few generations had any brothers with sons apparently? And this seems to be true of pretty much every house. Back to the main point, where are all the cadet branches? We get things like the Karstarks from landed branches from the past, but what about the hundreds of unlanded sons each house must have had?",gameofthrones
"So one thing has always bothered me when i watch it.

When Knights of the vale come to the aide of Jon and you watch as the stampede of knights run over most of the bolton forces you see Ramsey running to winterfell. When he returns and gets off his horse he says ""their army is gone"" and then the soldier says ""our army is gone"". Ramsey replies by saying "" we have winterfell, they dont have the force for siege"".

Now maybe im dumb, but im dumbfound by the fact ramsey thinks jon's forces ( not alot left, yes) including Knights of the vale means their army is gone. From what i can tell is that Knights of vale took out most of the foot soldiers that were surrounding jon's army. the only thing i can think of is that Ramsey thinks knights of the vale wont help jon siege winterfell?",gameofthrones
"Okay, I need to vent a little just because I have no where else to vent it to.... I waited patiently for GoT to end before I watched a single episode.  I'm bingeing now and am already a couple seasons into the 4th season.  The only character I actually care for is Daenerys Targaryen (okay, arya too).  And I have a feeling that the show is going to make me hate her very soon.  Oh, god, please make it not so.

And, of course I heard that the Red Wedding was a big deal over the years, but I always thought it was going to be about Jeoffry's wedding..... and later in the series.  Was surprised, but in a good way.

In the end, yeah, the show lives up to the hype (at least so far).... though I did hear the grumbling about the series end.",gameofthrones
"Sorry if that passage was already given, but I stumbled on that passage while rereading the books.

A Storm of Sword, Arya Chapter, Page 593:

The Brotherhood Without banner is on top of High Heart and Thoros, Lem and Beric are sitting with the Dwarf Witch and she says this:

""I dreamt a wolf howling in the rain, but no one heard his grief,"" the dwarf woman was saying. ""I dreamt such a clangor I thought my head might burst, drums and horns and pipes and screams, but the saddest sound was the little bells. I dreamt of a maid at a *feast with purple serpents in her hair, venom dripping from their fangs. And later I dreamt that maid again, slaying a savage giant in a castle built of snow"" She turned her head sharply and smiled through the gloom, right at Arya. ""You cannot hide from me, child. Come closer, now""*

And after that the dwarf women panic saying that Arya smell of death.

Now my theory is that the first part, the battle with the sad little bells, could be the burning of Kings Landing (it make sense in my head anyway) and the Maid would be Arya. The venom from her purple hair is used to kill Frey during is feast and the Savage Giant could be the Night King, the castle of snow Being Winterfell.

Now that I'm writing this I feel it's a bit of a stretch but I felt like sharing.

Edit: I am now aware that that passage was most probably about Sansa, the purple wedding and Little Robert.",gameofthrones

"The scenario:

Suddenly the Night King appears in a random location of your choosing on modern day Earth, he has his dragon but whether or not he has his White Walkers or wights or spiders is up to you. This scenario theorises how the Night King would fair in the real world, would he succeed and wipe us out, or would he be completely annihilated?

&amp;#x200B;

Let's set some rules for this fight.

1. Game of Thrones and A Song of Ice And Fire do not exist in this timeline, and nothing is written to replace it, the world would be entirely unprepared for the concept of the Night King and White Walkers with the only undead in media being generic zombies.
2. Other than that one difference this timeline is **exactly** the same as this timeline, there are no real life fairy tales or mythological creatures or magic.
3. The Night King appears suddenly out of no where, he has no myths or legends about him, he simply appears overnight in a random location of your choosing with the goal of the extinction of humanity.
4. The Night King and Wights have the same abilities and stats as they do in the show and books, it doesn't matter if that power or stat is impossible or unlikely in the real world, they still have it.
5. The Night King still has a zombie dragon, however whether or not he still has his entire army of the dead is up to you.
6. The Night King can still only be killed by obsidian or Valyrian steel, no exceptions.
7. Season 8 will mostly be ignored for this scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we've got the rules set let's first look at what the Night King has going for him;

* A couple of more thousand years worth of dead bodies.
* Wights with guns.
* Wights don't die from bullets as easily as humans do.
* A modern day military would be stricken with confidence that shooting something would work, and considering he would be in the real world this means the militaries of the world would be ignorant of and even at first at least scoff at the idea of the Night King being a supernatural non-natural threat... what's a good word for a threat that is fictional but then is suddenly not fictional?
* The Night King would be unhindered by CGI budgets, he would have a properly sized army that would indeed have animals in it, whether or not he has the giant spiders however is another thing up to you.
* Regular bullets, just like swords, simply shatter on contact with a White Walker.
* As said in rules the rules about Valyrian steel, dragon glass and fire still apply, however as Valyrian steel is a completely fictitious metal humanity in this scenario doesn't have access to it, and obsidian is a material that is not only surprisingly fragile in real life, but also isn't really a material one would think would do anything against the army of the dead, as such it is highly unlikely it would be utilised by the military, and of course fire doesn't affect the actual White Walkers.
* While the Night King cannot turn machinery into wights, as the wights have been seen using weapons and even chains to pull up a dead dragon from a frozen lake it is not hard to assume the wights could hijack these vehicles and use them.
* The armies, politicians and governments of today are fickle, cowardly and petty, and even though it is without question that many would join to fight the army of the dead, it is also likely we'd have multiple Cersei's.

&amp;#x200B;

But here's the things we have going for us, and is going against him;

* While the militaries of the world would indeed be unprepared and perhaps too confident and cocky at the start it is still the highly adaptive, resourceful, strategic and powerful military of today, the militaries will not have an intelligence decrease in this scenario.
* We have better technology and therefore better and more plentiful resources, we have huge maze like cities and better higher more sturdy walls.
* The Westeros armies only had men on horsebacks and a pair of dragons, we have armadas of bomber planes, ballistic missiles, tanks and other armoured vehicles to bulldozer over wights, flamethrowers, napalm, and of course potential experimental weaponry we'd develop in reaction to the armies of the dead, while we may not have dragons, we have something arguably even more powerful.
* The Night King also cannot kill and resurrect machinery, but if like said above he hijacks it, we could still potentially make use of self-destruction to stop that happening.
* And like said previously it isn't impossible that the Night King would try to hijack our war vehicles, but whether or not the Night King would be able to multitask controlling a large amount of wights using technology far more complicated than a horse is up for debate, there's also the question of if the Night King could even figure out how to drive these very complicated vehicles that take years of training to drive.
* Every single army in the world can join in on this, whereas in GoT only a handful of Westeros armies with two of Daenarys' armies were able to join the fight.
* We can mass burn our dead.
* No matter where the Night King is, if all the armies of the world come together to stop this apocalyptic threat he would be flanked and rammed up the ass by different armies.

"So I loved this show, I am so sad its over. I am so angry with how flat on it's face it fell at the end. In retrospect they should have merged season 7 with the first portion of 8 then stretched the last bit of 8 into its own full season. But that is not the road they went down. So the question remains, can you save game of thrones by just rewriting the last 6 episodes? I think its possible, and not only possible I want to do it with only 4.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 I felt episode 8.1 did a great job setting up the season, 8.2 was the high mark of the season so we are going to leave that untouched. If you could tack the good bits of 8.1 to the beginning of 8.2 and leave all the good of 8.2 that would be ideal and give you another episode to play with, but we aren't going that route.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\- First the Battle will play out in much the same way it did. Poor tactics and all. I can get past all that stupidity. Maybe make it look like more than 13 people make it out of this. (Ideally i think you have the Living do surprisingly well against the dead until the WW join the fight. Cause wouldn't that be cool WW actually fighting? It would also make Arya's jump off screen make more sense, less witnesses and all that jazz). But this post is going to be long enough without breaking down the whole damn battle.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Subverted Expectation's (hopefully properly) follow so be warned:

&amp;#x200B;

\- The NK kills Theon and begins his slow march towards Bran. We see the cool montage as our heroes make their last stands. Most of them play out the same way except more living folks (IE dothraki and Unsullied) to use later in the season so suddenly having what seems like a fully restocked army at KL isn't as jarring.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Splice these next scenes into the montage as you see fit. Once again im hitting the main points of what im changing for the sake of keeping this shortish.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Jon is huddled down behind the rock  hiding from Viserion, when he sees Arya. He nods to her and to the door leading to the God's Wood. She Nods back and Jon begins to pump himself up to stand and face his likely doom.

&amp;#x200B;

\-As Jon gets the dragon's attention we see Arya dart off towards the door, however she goes down one of the side doors instead of the main door. (maybe an ominous drumbeat here or something). As Arya enters the alcove she skids to a halt and the camera zooms out and we see a part of a white walker come into frame.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Viserion gets Ready to kill Jon but just as he is getting ready to something slams into the dragon. Then many more. The sound of caws can be heard as more and more black shapes slam into the dragon its body falling apart under the onslaught. Jon turns to see it is a huge flock of ravens (with milk white eyes if you are quick to spot it)

&amp;#x200B;

\- The shot cuts back to the NK who is almost to Bran, A single loud ravens caw breaks to music that had been welling. The NK turns his head back to see Jon standing in the Doorway Longclaw in hand. The NK Signals for his retinue of WW to part allowing him to take on Jon himself.

&amp;#x200B;

\-They Charge one another and an epic sword fight begins. Jon fights skillfully landing many blows that the NK seems to shrug off. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Eventually Jon is exhausted and the NK slaps Longclaw away throwing Jon to the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The Night King proceeds to beat Jon to the verge of unconsciousness and draws an ice dagger.

&amp;#x200B;

\-As he pulls the dagger, he is stopped from delivering a killing blow by some invisible force. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-The camera begins focus in on the weirdwood above his shoulder and zooms in. We see brann his hand touching the weirdwood, warg eyes, a frehsly carved symbol dripping with blood red sap a white walker symbol.

&amp;#x200B;

\- All of the WW are frozen in place. The NK with great effort begins to surge forward. Its clear the force he is battling is strong but he is a creature of sheer will. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-He becomes singularly focused on Bran. The camera will flash between him and brann, focusing only on their faces as he approaches.

\- As he approaches Bran's eyes go from milk white to blue. When the NK is almost to Bran the camera moves to Bran's face his eyes a deep dark pupiless blue .

&amp;#x200B;

\- Suddenly We here a sword cutting through flesh, we see bran gasp, his eyes quickly returning to their natural color but devoid of life. The camera pans down to a Valerian steel dagger plunged through his chest, as the camera pans back up it zooms out we Arya  over Bran's shoulder eyes locked on the NK, her eyes are losing the worg as the camera reaches them, shes starts to shudder as she realizes what has happened. We hear ice begin to crack. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Que disintegrating dead montage.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Add a scene  around when Danny is cradling jorah, of arya cradling brann, and jon holding arya.

&amp;#x200B;

Behind the episode. 

&amp;#x200B;

   My logic behind this is simple. It gives Brann something to do. It lets Arya fill her roll without having to be a literal flying plot device. I toyed around with having Arya take the face of the white walker, and stabbing the NK but it didnt feel right, and then you would have to address how the power of the faceless men applies to WW's.  Jon gets to fight the NK and is inadvertently responsible for ending the long night.

&amp;#x200B;

   I read the whole Jon Distracting the Dragon theory a while back, and I really liked It. I feel this scene shows the relationship between Jon and Arya. Jon knows he cannot reach the NK with the dragon in his way. He understands on some level what Arya has become. Arya on the other hand is driven, in this moment she is noone, she will accept her brother's sacrifice so she can get the job done. I made her run to the side because she is an assassin she is not going to charge in at the NK. She stumbles upon a white walker that she deals with off screen to give time for a fight betwen Jon and NK. 

&amp;#x200B;

Brandon's whole TER arc culminating in becoming king is dumb, pointless fantasy dribble. The fact that the Stark children for the most part get happy endings is once again dumb. Bran using his powers' and sacrificing himself ( a throw back to how he wanted to be an honourable knight) because of it is a rewarding end to the character. Using Arya as a weapon, allows for some more development of Arya. She will be a bit traumatized which i will delve into in my next post.

&amp;#x200B;

I really liked writing this out, and wanted to thank you for making it this far. I know the grammar is bad, and the spelling I am sure is even worse. Maybe next time i will just make a Youtube video instead lol.

"Instead of jumping from the shadows to kill the white walker king they should of had her disguise herself as one of the white walker generals. It would explain how she got near him better. At least in my opinion it would have made more sense.

"The thing I think people fail to take into account for why seasons 7 and 8 had to accelerate in pace is that there’s less characters in the story by that point, and most of them have come together into the same place(s) and are sharing scenes, when in previous seasons, there were more characters scattered around in their own isolated scenes.

So what this means is that each character needed their own screentime before, so we would spend each episode jumping around from character storyline to character storyline, with each storyline progressing only a bit per episode. But with seasons 7/8, there’s more group scenes which develop all the characters’ storylines at the same time, which means we move along with all the characters more efficiently. We’re not getting any less scenes with each character, we’re just getting all the characters at the same time, so it takes less screentime to stay updated with them all. We don’t have to do 4 different scenes to keep up with Jon, Arya, Bran and Sansa, because we have all 4 in the same scene now. Season 8 may have the fewest episodes, but I think if you measured it out, it actually probably has the most screentime for Jon, Dany, Arya, Sansa, and MAYBE Bran, of any season.

For example, if Dany going mad had happened in like season 5 or 6... it wouldn’t have been given any more scenes... it would be the same number of scenes and same amount of screentime for Dany... it just would have been more broken up across more episodes, and thus it would give us more weeks in between scenes to experience it... whereas in season 8, there’s no need to jump around so much, so we can pack those scenes into one episode. Same amount of time with Dany, but we’re not spending time in between each of her scenes to check in with Maergery and Littlefinger and Theon and Arya in Braavos and Jon at Hardhome, etc... because most of them are dead and Jon and Arya are a part of Dany’s storyline now, so we check in with them all concurrently.

Personally, I kind of prefer it that way in many ways. Sure, you lose a bit of the intimacy with each individual character since they are usually in groups instead of on their own, but we get more of an ensemble feel with seasons 7 and 8, because all the characters are actually interacting with each other, and we’re focusing more on the larger story that plays between all of them. And it may feel like you’re getting less because it’s going by faster, but each episode feels more like a full movie, covering a more complete piece of storytelling than the previous seasons’ episodes did. I remember in seasons 1-6, each episode would often feel like it was just a tiny bite from each storyline, and it would often feel a bit too broken up. I would love an episode like Blackwater, where it stayed focused on one storyline (or two or three storylines converging) and more storytelling got completed in an episode to make it feel more complete as a piece. It feels faster, but it’s no less time spent with the characters. It’s just being shown more efficiently.",gameofthrones
"I have never read any of the Ice and Fire books but I do know that there was a dragon called Balareon the Black Dread that one of the targaryens used to ride. I’m wondering for those who know the details about this dragon, how do you think he would have done compared to Drogon/Rhaegal during the Battle of Winterfell against the night king and his army? Do you think his power level was significantly higher and would it have made a huge difference?",gameofthrones

"Was anyone else disappointed that Sansa and Cersei didn’t get a last face to face? 

It’s not something I have seen mentioned but I was really hoping for one last interaction between the two once there had been a power shift. For Cersei to see who Sansa had become and for Sansa so be face to face with the woman who destroyed her world but also taught her how to live in it.

"We all know how much damage Grey Wind did alone. He's one fucking direwolf.

Imagine if they had hundreds of them in their ranks. Or maybe they had certain military units who were direwolf trainers who led them into battle.

It's pretty clear that direwolfs are well over intelligent enough to know who is the enemy and who is the master. 

The Starks could have easily domesticated mass amounts of direwolfs. If they did this, it would probably have similar levels of lethality to the Targaryen dragons. 

Sure, direwolfs can't burn down cities. But mass units of direwolfs could decimate enemy military ranks before the main armies even engaged.

Some people think that direwolfs are nearly extinct. While this is true south of the wall, I've learned from the wiki that they exist in great number beyond the wall. 

It would be no trouble for Northerners to venture beyond the wall and acquire direwolfs over time until they had bread generations of direwolfs obedient to the Stark men and the other lords of the North.

This would have been especially helpful to the Northerners because their kingdom has a very low population, which probably contributes to the reason why Robb Stark could only amass 20000 men.

Direwolfs would be the key to their power.  Especially since wargs come from the first men blood in the North aswell.

I don't know why this isn't a thing. It would have made the North 10000000x more cool than they already are. Their blood is just as magical as Valerian blood, their power should be coupled with their beasts.",gameofthrones
" I feel like Daenerys is one of the worst characters in GoT.

I've started rewatching the series from the start and after 3 seasons shes just kinda got on my nerves. Every scene I see with her face in it she is doing that typical generic fantasy glare just off the camera at someone who is a bad person that she doesnt like all with really epig fantasy music telling me that she is really mighty and heroic and stuff.

And she snarks and sneers at everything everyone says and doesnt take shit from no one and is so cool and objective and awesome and it honestly feels cheap as shit and splits the show into two parts: one where everyone is human, (sort of) has gimmicks, qualities and flaws, and then theres across the pond where Daenerys is so awesomely awesome, I feel like there is an oversaturation of fantasy tropes with her that spoils the gritty, almost realistic boredom of a medieval society with conflicting politics and ideology and tension.

Daenerys just goes from one city to the other - one minor setback, and then comes out on top with some super extreme payoff that relies on the incompetency of everyone else (who is a bad guy). She just hops from city to city freeing slaves (basically single handedly) because she is really moral and stuff and she is supposed to gain the viewers approval.

We occasionally see Barristan or Jorah bicker about something random (because they dont actually seem to do anything important, its all Daenerys pretty much) or we just see Jorahs sad face when she does something epig and unorthodox or something.

It was fun to watch that fat merchant guy roast her over her shite diplomacy because she was still a rookie at the queen gig but since then she has been so epicly epic and all the people she doesnt like have been so stupidly stupid that its just not fun to watch at all. Id rather she just took that Yunkai guys offer and sailed off to Westeros to actually get shit started instead of this endless starvation of fun and stagnation of intrigue.",gameofthrones
"I think it’s so badass that Sansa channels a lot from all her teachers in this scene. 
I think Sansa begins to play Littlefingers game when Dany mentions Jon. She wants to know Dany’s motives so she assumes the worst (the worst being Dany is manipulating Jon and that is why Sansa says “men do stupid things for women”) and it works. 

Dany responds with “My whole life I have known one goal: the iron throne”(which I think that statement in and of itself is a red flag to Sansa because she has known other people with the same motivations). Dany says her sole purpose was the iron throne and that her sole reason for being there was her love for Jon, trying to manipulate Sansa to think she’s being honest. Jorah (being a northerner) knows the North is currently on Sansa’s side and that Dany needs to make peace with Sansa in order to have a peaceful relationship with the North. Dany thinks in order to make peace with the North(Sansa) she has to exploit the North(Sansa). Dany knows they both love Jon, so she uses Jon as a way to manipulate Sansa to make peace with Sansa. Sansa sees through Dany, that Dany is trying to manipulate her which confirms Sansa’s suspicions.

 Dany is speaking some truth that she does love Jon and that is part of the reason why she’s there but it is not the sole reason but Dany is acting like it is to trick Sansa. That yes Dany is there because she loves Jon but she’s there because she knows how big of a threat the NK is to her rule and her 7 kingdoms (he did kill her dragon) and she wants to gain the North on her side by bending the North to her will, either by manipulation or by force.  It’s why she’s trying to manipulate Sansa, to get Sansa to bend to her will but Sansa doesn’t fall for it. Dany shows to Sansa that she isn’t there to ally with the North, she’s there to control it. This is when Sansa sees Danys motives. Sansa realizes that Dany isn’t actually there to improve their relationship or make real allies with the North, she’s there to manipulate Sansa and get the North under her wing. Dany is there to make peace with the North(Sansa), but by control, not by actually making peace. 

Sansa knows it and after she learns Dany’s true motives, she wants to ask for the North’s independence as a final check to see if Dany actually wants a good alliance with the North and give the North what they want (or at least offer a compromise) or if Dany is all about power and control. So before Sansa asks she warms up to Dany first. Sansa wants to be on Dany’s good side before she drops the bomb. She does what Margaery does and chuckles and warms up to Dany by admitting a fault that she should’ve said thank you when Dany arrived to draw Dany in, and all the meanwhile Dany thinks she has Sansa within her grasps and the moment that Dany thinks she has Sansa on her side, Sansa drops the bomb about the North’s independence like Olenna or Cersei would and Dany loses control and her true colors just bleed out as clear as day. 

When this occurs Sansa really gets Dany’s motivations out in the open for her to see. Dany realizes that Sansa has caught her and that’s why she pulls her hand away. It effectively shows that Dany is just another tyrant who won’t accept less power for peace. Dany’s pissed that Sansa exposed her. That Dany could really care less about what the North wants and she’s all about what she wants. If Dany did care about the actual North then she wouldn’t have given such a volatile response when Sansa mentions the North’s independence and she wouldn’t have tried manipulating Sansa. Dany is just all about Dany. Her only goal is power. All Dany wants is power. That Dany is just more of the same. Such an awesome scene between two powerful characters trying to up each other in the game but unfortunately Dany doesn’t have the experience like Sansa and she doesn’t know how the game is played. Sansa makes Dany look like a fool. Sansa knows Dany for who she is now and Dany is only further away from where she was before.",gameofthrones
"We know that Dany's lack of fertility is made to be a pretty big point in seasons 1-7 and everyone just kinda forgot about the major possibility that Jon would get Dany pregnant. So where did this go? Well, D&amp;D is known for their subtle story telling, such as the cock jokes in season 8 meaning that Tyrion hasn't used his cock in this season and lost all intellect, subtle. Well with that we know that Dany isn't going to be declared pregnant, but will be shown in a indirect way.

Dany's child, never shown, plays an important role in the final episode of Game of Thrones. Starks are connected to warging and Targs are connected to dragons, so what would a Stargaryen be connected to? Warging into dragons. Just after Dany's death, we see Drogon approach Jon and it seems that he is about to get roasted, but last second he turns away and melts the iron throne. I believe this is caused by Dany and Jon's child warging into Drogon and deciding that they didn't want their daddy burnt so instead to destroy the thing that killed Dany, the throne. Now I know what you're thinking, a fetus couldn't possibly understand the metaphor for power that caused their moms death. And you'd be right, they instead think that the thing with swords sticking out of it stabbed their mom.

After burning the iron throne, the child still in the womb wants to be born. So without a second to say goodbye to their dad, they fly away and the baby is delivered.

"I’m a little late to the party but I just began watching GOT and just finished the last episode today. I agree with everyone that the writing was rushed and that they just coped out at the very end. However what pissed me off the most was how after they killed Daenerys that was just it. The whole show they talked about how her and Khal Drogo were going to meet in death. Even when she went to that house in the beginning (I can’t remember the name) and she saw him and the baby in the tent he said that he wasn’t going to go forward without her. 

Had they done a five minute fucking scene of her finding him in death with her baby in the tent before they went on I would have felt better about her ultimate demise. They alluded so much to this and the fact that her “great” ending was being killed and the dragon mourning her and carrying her off killed me. The great Mother of Dragons died...and that was it. Like really?!? That’s all you’re going to show?? I don’t feel like they properly ended her. They could have brought the thing full circle with her and him at the end. Out of all the things that disappointed me at the terrible ending of this great show this is what got me the most.

"I'm genuinely interested on any thoughts you guys have on this theory I've been wrestling with lately—regarding Arya's fate intertwined with the whole faceless men storyline.The show left so many crucial plot points unresolved or open-ended... ~~one of the~~ **~~countless~~** ~~issues with season 8~~... So I've been racking my brain &amp; diving into countless fan theories in an attempt to create the pieces needed to fill these huge gaps in the grand puzzle that is the plot of Game of Thrones.

**Soooooo without further ado, for the sake of creative debate, here's the theory:**

Let's say that Arya was relentlessly recruited by the faceless men because they knew with their collective hive-minds that she'd be the one to eventually kill the Night King and end the long night.

They went to great lengths to manipulate her slowly, first through Syrio Forel, then obviously through Jaqen H'ghar⁠—who in this case *is* Syrio Forel, who escaped Meryn Trant off-screen, and then changed faces to escape the Red Keep and eventually work his way back to crossing paths with Arya again on the way to Harrenhal.(Obviously keeping to the show's storyline with Jaqen H'ghar, not the like in the books where he MAY have been known as the Alchemist in Old Town &amp; all that.)

So... Okay. Right. This ALMOST makes sense, because it explains why they just allowed her to leave the house of Black &amp; White without sending more assassins after her and all that jazz.

HOWEVER, that “collective hive-mind” thing all the true faceless men have is supposedly subservient to the Many Faced God/God of Death. They gave up their dreams, desires, identities, &amp; ultimately their *souls* to become no one... only an instrument for their God.That being said, isn’t the Night King &amp; his army supposed to be the EMBODIMENT of death? So therefore wouldn’t the faceless men see the Night King almost as a Jesus Christ-like figure???? Why would they be on a mission to manipulate a girl since childhood into killing the most powerful “living” manifestation of their God? *“There is only one god, and his name is Death.”*

 Also Jaqen made a point to instill in Arya how important it is to *""not steal from the Many Faced God""* or else *""a debt would have to be paid""*.  So wouldn't destroying the Night King &amp; the army of the dead be like the ultimate form of stealing from the God of Death? Or did she need to do this so Dany could then take on the ""role"" or ""mission"" of the Night King and become the  one who ""repays"" the God of Death by taking the lives of the hundreds of thousands in King's Landing???

As you can see I'm ending up with more questions than answers, but I must admit it's fun to ponder and try to connect the dots from the show's perspective, in order to try and scratch that psychological itch I have to answer the questions D&amp;D never bothered to touch base on.

Pleaseeee feel free to offer any thoughts/insights/critiques you may have on this topic! I'm genuinely excited to continue brainstorming on this. :D",gameofthrones
"I’ve made a few comments recently pointing out some of the many mistakes the show runners made during the series including the Kingslayer flashback from Bran’s vision in which several things appear to be wrong with this scene and relating to it. From memory they include...

- Jaimie has his short hair like he does during the present instead of long hair (which doesn’t technically have to be a mistake; it’s possible he just had short hair back then in show canon, but let’s be real, they should have put a wig on him)

- When Jaimie reflects on this moment in the tub with Brienne in Season 3 he claims there were half a million people in the city at the time yet in Season 7 it’s stated multiple times there are now a million; an insanely large increase 

- *Jaimie is wearing the golden Kingsguard armor we see him and the rest of the Kingsguard wear at the start of the series instead of the silver Targaryen Kingsguard armor we see that they wore at the time during the Tower of Joy flashbacks*

I want to focus on the last of these because after just reading the second Jaimie chapter in ASOS it appears that this might have actually been an intentional decision to (kind of) reference the books. In the books the Kingsguard during both Aerys, Robert and Jorffery’s reign wear white armor and when Jaimie reflects about when he kills the mad king he notes that he was not wearing his Kingsguard armor when he entered the throne room, but instead his golden armor, and is annoyed that no one ever points that out, however he was still wearing his KG cloak and reflects that he should have taken it off.

It doesn’t quite translate to the show however because instead of the golden armor being a personal armor of Jaimie it is instead the same armor that becomes the standard for all of the KG during Robert’s reign so instead of looking like an intentional choice in the show it just looks like they put him in a uniform that didn’t exist yet. It’s still kind of sloppy, but not quite as sloppy as I originally thought. I get what they might have been going for (if they were in fact actually trying to reference this part of the books and it wasn’t a full-on continuity mistake) but without context or the same armor uniforms from book to show, it still ends up making little sense and a non-reader who picked up on this would have every reason to believe it made zero sense.

Maybe Jaimie’s personal armor became the new standard for everyone during Robert’s reign? A way to symbolize the alliance of Lannister and Baratheon? But Jaimie wasn’t even Lord Commander then and he was being pardoned...I feel like you don’t make your protectors dress like a guy you just had to pardon. Maybe Robert just preferred the way it looked to the less flashy armor of Areys’s reign. We know Robert liked to spend cash on frivolous stuff like that.

" I'm completely unspoiled on the details. I know that there is loud dissatisfaction. I disliked the direction they were taking things in seasons 6 and 7, as I began to sense Hollywood Values seeping into the storytelling and character designs. My questions (please no spoilers):

\-is the outcry a result of an ambiguous ending?

\-does season 8 re-contextualize any of the characters in a deleterious way?

\-does season 8 continue channeling the 201X American political ideology that crept into 6 and 7?

\-does it turn into a postmodern deconstruction of the franchise?

\-did they fail to elegantly wrap up all of the storylines in the final few episodes?

Reason for question:

I do not want my positive feelings for the franchise damaged and I would be satisfied with head canon branching from season 7, thus I'm willing to steer clear of season 8. 6 and 7 damaged characters I enjoyed in the books and took things in what I felt were silly and clumsy directions.

**How Game of Thrones should have ended**

*This storyline commences at the beginning of Season 7 Episode 5*.

Jon Snow, at Dragonstone, begs Daenerys to pause her war against the Lannisters to help the north fight the White Walkers. No one proposes capturing a wight and bringing it back as proof, an obvious suicide mission. Instead, Jon asks Daenerys to fly north with her dragons to the Wall, to see the threat for herself. If Jon is lying, she can return her focus to King's Landing with only a few days lost. If he is right, she will get the opportunity to measure the threat with her own eyes. Daenerys’s advisors argue over whether this is a good idea.

As they consider this option, Daenerys repositions her troops from Dragonstone to strengthen their position against Cersei. While sailing in transit, her navy is again caught off-guard in a devastating ambush. Euron Greyjoy kills Viserion with a scorpion, destroys dozens of ships, and captures Missandei. Yara Greyjoy barely escapes and flees back to the Iron Islands. Daenerys retreats with the rest of her forces.

Enraged, Daenerys shuts down any talk of traveling north and turns her full focus to King’s Landing. She issues Cersei an ultimatum: release Missandei and relinquish the throne or see the Red Keep burn to the ground. Tyrion pleads with her to reconsider, and Daenerys threatens to depose him as Hand of the Queen if he does not get on board. Varys, concerned, quietly helps Jon Snow flee back to the north while Daenerys is distracted. Daenerys has decided she cannot help the northerners until Cersei is gone, and Varys fears Daenerys will keep Jon Snow captive until Jon bends the knee, preventing him from leading the fight against the dead. ""Gather what troops you can, find your strongest defensive position, and guard the north,"" Varys advises Jon. ""Every house in Westeros depends on you now, though none of them will help you.""

Jon flees north. Daenerys, furious to find that Jon has left without her knowledge, begins mistrusting Varys, although he and Tyrion manage to convince her to allow the continued mining and shipment of dragonglass northward. In the meantime, Daenerys meets Cersei at the walls of King's Landing. As in season 8, Cersei executes Missandei in front of Daenerys. Daenerys's makes up her mind: it is time for war.

The night before the attack on King's Landing, Tyrion manages to contact Jaime, who is in Kings Landing with Cersei. Tyrion begs him to convince Cersei to surrender and ring the bells of King's Landing as soon as they see the fight is lost. The attack on King's Landing proceeds similar to the events of Season 8 Episode 5, with a few differences. First, Daenerys manages to protect her two surviving dragons from the scorpions (which she now knows to be a threat) through a tactical maneuver. She realizes the Lannisters expect an attack from outside the walls of the city and have aimed the scorpions outward. To surprise them, she flies over the scorpions above the clouds, safely out of view, and descends from the sky at the *center* of the city. Sending one dragon to the walls and another to the bay, she attacks the scorpions from behind, destroying them before they can be turned around.

As in Season 8, she burns a hole clear through King's Landing's walls, allowing the Dothraki and Unsullied to charge in. After pitched street battles, the bells are rung. Daenerys, still enraged, chooses to fly straight to the Red Keep and burns it down, crushing and burning the hundreds of human shields hiding there along with Jaime and Cersei. Along the way, Daenerys also torches hundreds of surrendered, unarmed Lannister soldiers on the streets. She doesn't attack civilians indiscriminately as in Season 8, but the devastation is terrible nonetheless.

Once in charge of King's Landing, Daenerys begins to purge the city of Lannister loyalists, executing dozens who served Cersei whose pledges of surrender and allegiance she does not trust.

In the meantime, the dead have reached the Wall. Jon leads a defense of Castle Black, where northern troops have assembled hundreds of barrels of hot oil to stop the dead. The Night King sends tens of thousands of dead to climb up the wall, rows and rows of them, one after another. They overwhelm the living, tossing live soldiers off the top of the wall, forcing Jon and the northerners to retreat. Once the dead reach the top, they pause in a moment of unnerving stillness. Slowly, silently, they lean over the top of the wall and fall downwards, landing in Castle Black by the hundreds with sickening crunches. The falling corpses crescendo into a thunder and then suddenly stop, followed by another moment of perfect silence. The Night King lifts his hands and the dead rise again within Castle Black. They methodically open the gate of the Wall from the inside. A hundred thousand wights march through the gate and head southward towards Winterfell.

Jon knows that King's Landing is at war and is uncertain what has happened there. He concludes the northerners cannot hope to save the north nor Winterfell, and so leads a full retreat of the living to the Twins, abandoning his home. The Riverlands, he decides, represents their best hope to stop the Night King. It offers a natural fortress, a moat, and a chokepoint through which the dead can hopefully be stalled until help arrives. He sends urgent ravens to King's Landing and Dragonstone pleading for help.

At the Twins, the living prepare for their battle with the dead. Jon destroys the bridge, which will force the dead to cross through water. Bran and Sam tell Jon he is Aegon Targaryen, and word of this revelation begins to spread. As Jon grapples with this news and thinks through his battle preparations, he asks Bran for guidance, hoping to get wisdom from the Three Eyed Raven.

In response, Bran tells him the story of how the Night King was born. ""The Children of the Forest faced an existential threat,"" Bran explains. ""And they defended themselves with an apocalyptic weapon. Soon, we, too, will face the same question. What are we prepared to sacrifice to win this war?"" Jon begs for clearer guidance, but Bran responds cryptically: ""I must go now. The Night King will come for me. Protect me, at all costs, until the very end.""

The dead arrive, and an epic battle ensues similar to Season 8 Episode 3. The northerners, the Knights of the Vale, and the freefolk valiantly hold the dead off with flaming trenches (courtesy of Melisandre of course), dragonglass arrows, and heavy ballista. But the dead pile on top of one another to cross the moats of water and fire and soon overwhelm the living. Brienne of Tarth, leading the vanguard, is buried under a wave of undead within moments and torn apart. Tormund and Gendry are also killed in the fighting. Beric Dondarrion and the Hound give their lives to save Arya. Arya, in turn, saves Jon, so that he can find Bran and lead the retreat. Arya chases after them, but the earth beneath her feet crumbles under the weight of the dead, sending her falling into the river. The dead being to enclose on the fleeing survivors when at the last moment jets of flame from Daenerys's dragons streak overhead, cleaving a safe path for those still alive to retreat. Arya and many others are left for dead.

The northerners flee to King's Landing as the dragons slow the advance of the army of the dead. Unsullied and Dothraki dig a series of flaming trenches along the route to King’s Landing to give the living time to prepare new defenses.

In King's Landing, Daenerys locks up Jon, Sansa, and the northern lords, demanding that they bend the knee to her. She has learned who Jon is and decides she must force them to bow now, before the dead arrive, while there still exists an existential threat to unify all of Westeros behind her banner.

Sansa begs Jon not to give in, reasoning that Daenerys will need the northerners to defeat the dead and will eventually relent. Jon agonizes over whether to bend the knee as Varys begins scheming to overthrow Daenerys in favor of Jon. Daenerys discovers this and burns Varys alive. Tyrion, disillusioned, throws away his Hand of the Queen medallion. Daenerys, with anger and sadness, considers whether to execute Tyrion as well. Fearing further loss of life and time as the dead march southward, Jon thinks back to Bran's words and decides to bend the knee on the condition that Daenerys spare Tyrion and cease her executions of Lannisters who have surrendered. She agrees, and the northerners bitterly follow Jon's lead.

While this is happening, we intersperse with shots of Bran wharging back in time. We see how King Aerys Targaryen first took the throne as a strong, wise king. These shots are interspersed with flashbacks of Daenerys’s journey to the iron throne, setting up a parallel between the rise – and, perhaps, fall – of both rulers, father and daughter.

Finally, the dead close in on King's Landing. The city is greatly weakened from Daenerys's attack, with no Red Keep and a gaping hole burned in its outer walls. Neither are there any ships left, as all have been burned by dragonfire. There will be no retreat.

A final epic battle with the dead ensues. The Dothraki are sent outside the city to flank the lines of the dead on horseback and whittle away at their numbers via dragonglass arrows. They are accompanied by a portion of the Unsullied forces who take up positions outside of the city to funnel the dead to strategic chokepoints. Jon and Daenerys plan to buy enough time for them to assassinate the Night King, who has adopted a defensive position behind his army, with the surviving two dragons. They scorch their way through the undead and reach the Night King, and for a moment it appears they are poised to kill him with dragonfire. But suddenly, one after the other, Drogon and Rhaegal are hit by ice spears flung by White Walkers. Jon and Daenerys fall with the dragons to their deaths.

The dead cleave their way through to King's Landing. They pour through the hole in the outer wall and make their way through the city towards the ashes of the Red Keep, slaughtering soldiers and civilians along the way. Grey Worm and the remaining survivors make their last stand at city center, when the Night King arrives. Raising his hands, he brings the recently slaughtered residents of Kings Landing back to life. They begin their inexorable march towards the last of the survivors.

Cut to shots of Tyrion, Sansa, Grey Worm, Jorah, Bronn, and other main characters' faces as they realize: this is the end.

We cut to Bran who is sitting in one of the few remaining rooms of the Red Keep, his eyes closed. The *Light of the Seven*musical theme, from season 6 episode 10, begins playing in the background. We cut back and forth between Bran’s visions of King Aerys and the frenzied last stand the living are now taking against the dead. In current day King's Landing, soldiers frantically shout ""Burn them! Burn them all!"" as they shoot flaming arrows and toss torches at buildings in a desperate attempt to stop the dead. Hodor-style, these shots merge with Bran's visions of King Aerys, who begins shuddering. Shouts of ""Burn them! Burn them all!"" ring in the background as we see Bran’s meddling transform a once stoic Aerys into the mad king. We montage through his crazed reign, watching him torch Ned Stark's father and brother alive, watching him laugh as his enemies writhe in wildfire, watching him command his pyromancer to burn down King’s Landing.

Cut to Tyrion, who is watching from behind the fighting as the dead push into the final lines of Unsullied. His face darkens with a new resolve and he begins running.

Cut back and forth between the Mad King yelling ""Burn them all!"" and Tyrion running into the dungeons and sewers beneath King's landing. Suddenly, a moment of clarity and stillness appears in Bran’s visions. A single moment snaps to life: the Mad King commanding his pyromancers to fill every corner of King's Landing’s sewers with jars of wildfire. ""Stock it under Flea Bottom, under the Sept of Baelor, under the streets, under the walls, under the Red Keep,"" he commands wildly. We see the pyromancers carefully placing endless jars of wildfire throughout the underground. Cut back to the dead, present-day, who are nearly atop Grey Worm's last line of soldiers. Sansa and the last line of unarmed survivors behind the Unsullied tremble in fear and close their eyes, preparing to die.

Final cut to Tyrion, who is now holding a torch underground. He has spilled out jars and jars of wildfire before him. Closing his eyes, he drops the torch.

We see a stunning, birds-eye shot of King's Landing filled with undead in concentric circles around a final circle of Unsullied defending the last of the living at city center. After a moment of silence, we see green fire explode through the streets of the city, tearing the entire capital apart in a roaring blaze of light. Everyone within the city walls is killed, including the Night King. The tens of thousands of dead still outside the city collapse as the Night King's magic dissipates.

As the dust settles and the wildfire slowly dies down, survivors eventually make their way to the ashes of King’s Landing. The Iron Throne is no more. Virtually all the great houses are gone. But survivors across Westeros who escaped the Night King's path trickle in to see what is left of their kingdom. Lords, soldiers, and other survivors from Dorne, the Vale, the Iron Islands, Highgarden, and elsewhere arrive. The surviving Dothraki and Unsullied who fought outside the city return as well. Daario Naharis arrives from Meereen with the Second Sons, having heard that Daenerys’s forces were under siege. He is devastated to learn of her death. An emissary from the Iron Bank, with the Golden Company in tow, arrives, planning to place the surviving lords of Westeros under Braavos's vassalage to force them to repay Cersei's debt. All parties begin to argue over who should rule Westeros. New battle lines are drawn.

As tensions reach a boiling point, a figure suddenly emerges from the falling ash in the distance. The lords look up and find, to their shock, a bloody but determined Daenerys marching towards them. Daario Naharis, the Dothraki, the Unsullied, and Yara Greyjoy immediately unite behind her command and present a unified front against the other lords. With steel in her voice, Daenerys commands them to bend the knee, and one after another they obey. She turns to the outnumbered emissary from the Iron Bank and tells him he will forgive all debts and cease to finance the wars of other nations forevermore, or she will flatten Braavos. Terrified, he agrees and flees with the Golden Company.

The survivors slowly begin to rebuild as a fierce Daenerys consolidates her power. Finally, she calls a council of the surviving lords and ladies of Westeros.

""When I came to Westeros, I swore that I would break the wheel in which powerful families crush those beneath them in their constant struggle for power,"" she says. ""I intend to keep that promise. You have all pledged to follow me as your queen. But who will you follow when I am gone? Who will your children follow? My descendants will not be bound to rule with my sense of justice, just as I am not bound by my father's madness. Together, are we not simply recreating the insanity of the wheel?""

""In all of my travels,"" she continues, ""I have come across only one city that has progressed beyond the savagery of the wheel, where the many are not preyed upon by the few. It is a city that has flourished, that has accumulated vast riches, without relying on slavery or serfdom for its keep. Its name is Qarth. The merchant council that ruled Qarth showed me only cruelty and deceit. But their job was not to show mercy to foreigners. Their duty was to serve the residents of their city. And they did so well.""

""As long as one house rules the Seven Kingdoms, the wheel persists,"" she says. ""And so, from today onwards, I abdicate and abolish the throne. There will be no more Kings or Queens in Westeros. Instead, the lords and ladies here today will rule together as a council. Each year a different lord will serve as lead council member and steward of the Seven Kingdoms. Daario, you will lead the council in its first year, and your task will be to establish by consensus a set of rules through which the council will govern itself.""

""The Unsullied,"" she continues, turning to their commander, ""will remain the protectors of the realm. They will hold loyalty not to any lord or house, but to the rules governing this council. They will ensure no house takes control over the others, and that the council never abrogates its duty to rule on behalf of all the people of Westeros. As free men, any of the Unsullied may choose to leave and pursue their own lives across Westeros. But you will also allow young men and women across the kingdom to join your forces if they prove strong of mind, body, and character.""

The lords and ladies sit in stunned silence. Finally Daario says, ""My queen, what of you? Will you not lead the council?""

Daenerys smiles. ""I have done my part here. I will leave this place and find another people, in another corner of the world, in need of liberation."" She leaves the chamber as the assembled nobles grapple with the news.

Daario chases after her to her chambers. ""My queen!"" He says. ""I don't understand. You have spent your entire life fighting for the iron throne. This kingdom needs you. How can you leave now?""

She shakes her head. ""I'm not the same woman I once was,"" she tells him. ""Give up, Daario. Enough. Stay here and bring a new dream to life.""

Daario shakes his head. ""What happened to you since Meereen?"" He asks. ""Who have you become?""

With a glimmer in her eye, turning back one last time as she opens the backdoor out of her chambers onto the ramparts outside, she responds: ""No one.""

The *Many Faced God* musical theme comes on as Daenerys closes the door behind her and leaves a stunned Daario behind. Smiling, she lifts a hand under her chin and pulls back her face to reveal: Arya Stark.

We see Arya walk to the docks of King's Landing and embark on a ship for a new adventure.

**TL,DR:**

Night King defeats the northerners and heads down to King's Landing.

Bran travels back in time to make the mad king go mad, so that he will fill King's Landing with jars of wildfire, so that Tyrion can use the wildfire to blow up all of King's Landing along with the army of the dead and kill the Night King.

Daenerys survives and creates a new council of lords and ladies to jointly rule Westeros, abdicating her claim to the throne - but in the last scene we learn this was actually Arya wearing Daenerys's face.

&amp;#x200B;

*In case clarification is needed: Arya survives her fall at the Twins but arrives at King’s Landing only after the dead are defeated. She finds Daenerys's body on the way, and takes Daenerys's face.*",gameofthrones
"After the dissapointing end of the tv series I decided to finally pick up the books which I had already bought. And I gotta say the beginning was basically identically to the series (to its credit) so I was a bit unmotivated to keep going for the first book as I expected it to be the exact same as the show.
I just finished Bran's chapter that starts at page 237, in which Tyrion and the Nights Watch arrive at Winterfell.

The chapter doesnt really divert much as the show except for the ending, when Robb carries Bran to his bed and they share a moment in the darkness, exchaning few words but establishing them as real people. Real children, scared children. But even though they're both scared they have each other to rely on.

And this scene alone made me feel way more for Robb and Bran than I ever did during the entire show. I already dread the Red Wedding again. But now I wanna read more, be more invested and feel with these characters.",gameofthrones
[SPOILERS] I just remembered there was a scene in seson 7 where john told all the lords to train there women in combat. Because they cant win if only half the population is fighting... where were these women on the battlefield? If i remember well they went to hide in the cripts!!! How could they forget about this??? they the ones writing this line in the first place.,gameofthrones
