891,"In the long years of his reign, King Brandon Stark was not loved by the smallfolk nearly so much as the quietude of his rule. Bran himself was a distant and near-silent king, with no taste for great celebrations or inspiring rhetoric. But when the Driftwood Queen demanded the independence of the Iron Islands in 313 AC, Bran granted it almost immediately; the expanded fleet that the Greyjoys had long laboured over had hardly left its harbours before the raven returned from King’s Landing. Dorne’s autonomy grew not with violence, but with carefully negotiated partnership, and though now Ornelia Martell is styled the Princess of Dorne, the Maesters of Oldtown would say that the lands beyond the Red Mountains are more closely entwined – through trade and goodwill – with the Five Kingdoms than ever before. It is said that, though the Seven Kingdoms became Six through the sacrifice of a million lives, the Six became Five without a single drop of spilt blood.

These years of calm saw the turn of seven long summers and seven mild winters. The external threats to Bran’s reign – the Braavosi blockade of 309, sponsored by the Iron Bank and facilitated by many mercenaries; the Second Crossing of the Dothraki Khalasar in 318; the Septons’ Rising of 331 or the coming of the Red Refugees in the decade afterward – seemed less desperate in comparison to the crises endured by King’s Landing in the warlike years before, as if an invisible hand were directing events, by slight nudges, toward the ends of stability and prosperity. Though terrible battles were rumoured in many parts of Essos, their effects were seldom felt in Westeros. One might also have expected some friction to arise from the King’s worship of the Old Gods, but Bran’s habits were so private, and his style of rule so tolerant, that for a time it seemed impossible that internal strife and religious discord could ever have been the hallmark of the Six – and then the Five – Kingdoms.

The absence of vengeful dragons surely helped. There are folk in Volantis who, in exchange for a cup of sweet wine, will tell the tale of their fathers or grandfathers catching sight of a great winged creature that obscured the waning moon in its eastbound flight, high above the city. Some of the Ghiscari traders who can now be so frequently found in Planky Town or Storm's End tell a similar story: that in the cold night after the death of the Dragon Queen, her last child, screaming with anguish, caused many a night-time watcher to return to their decks in great haste. Daenerys was carried far into the east, perhaps as far as the Shadowlands or the unknown forests of Ulthos. What became of her remains is not known. Some say the creature flew until fatigue brought it plummeting into deep, uncharted waters. Others suggest that reports of dragons - fleeting glimpses, disappearing livestock, bone-chilling cries in the lonely places of the world - are not always the product of fancy or hysteria.

Bran outlived every member of his original Small Council, and outlasted – as far as can be known for certain – every other Stark. Of his sister Arya, the Hero of Winterfell, little was ever heard again: she sailed West, beyond the reckoning and knowledge of all, within days of her brother’s coronation, leaving only the rumours that are shared and rendered into stories in every town of Westeros and Essos: of a single, ragged-looking Raven that flew out of a storm over the Western Sea decades later and on to the last high tower of the Red Keep, bearing a message whose contents were seen only by the King and his closest advisors. The tale that is most often told is that Arya reached the land that is West of West, and shared what details she could of the wonders and terrors she found there before meeting her own mysterious fate. What is certainly true is that, slowly and deliberately, Bran has been fortifying the Western coast of the Five Kingdoms throughout the latter part of his reign. 

Sansa Stark, the Queen in the North, maintained strong relations with her brother’s kingdom and toward the end of her life was frequently to be found in the courts of King’s Landing or Dorne, having inherited from her mother a preference for the warmth. After her passing in 371 her bannermen selected Harrold Royce to rule the North.

Of the fate of Jon Snow – the Bastard of Winterfell, the Half-Stark, the Queenslayer, the Resurrected, the Friend of Wolves, twice named Lord Commander of Castle Black – very little is known. The Hand of the King, Tyrion Lannister, visited the North and the Wall in the first decade after Snow's return to the Night’s Watch. Of that visit he records that the Wall was all but unmanned, and that those who stood upon it were facing south, rather than north. The Hand was told that Jon Snow had, years earlier, gone forth with a great company of wildlings and northerners, disappearing into the dark forests of the Lands of Always Winter. Their exploration of those unmapped places are the subject of much conjecture: that Snow had been named the King Beyond the Wall, that he had made contact with the last enclaves of the Children of the Forest, that he was overseeing the settling of great underground cities among the twisting, interconnected roots of the Weirwood trees. It is said that the Greyjoys know something of those northernmost lands, and that Sansa Stark, before her death, knew more, but would not tell. The Lonely King, Bran the Broken, Bran the Bridgemaker, Bran the Wheelbreaker, surely knew more still – but in his quiet places and sanctuaries around King’s Landing, he seldom spoke a word, and to each successive Hand and Archmaester he entrusted fewer of his thoughts.

Finally, in 382 AC, at the start of his eighth winter, King Brandon embarked upon a final journey. He had aged but slowly in all the years of his reign, but age had come upon him nevertheless. His Kingsguard escorted him on the first leg of his journey – a secretive consultation followed by long weeks of contemplation or reading in Oldtown – and then took him as far as the Wall when at last he travelled North. After a night in the almost uninhabited Castle Black, Bran ordered the Kingsguard to return to Winterfell, and so on to the Five Kingdoms, where they were to supervise the selection of a new King of Westeros.

The last of the Starks then travelled North, beyond the wall, quite alone. The Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch reported that distant figures joined the King’s horse just before it disappeared into the treeline. No sight or word of King Bran has been heard in the long years since.

The winters are deeper now, and though King’s Landing is again fair and no great wars have troubled Westeros for many decades, some of the world’s wonder has diminished since the end of the time of Bran the Wheelbreaker.

893,"He died thinking that Daenerys was a truly good person. He once told to her 

""You have a gentle heart. You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times when I look at you and I still can’t believe you’re real.""

Now that I think about it, I'm almost glad he died so he couldn't see what Deanerys did, what she turned out to be.

894,"This show has always made me angry.  I was angry when they executed Lady, I was angry when they executed Ned, I was angry with what they did to Drogo, I was angry after the Red Wedding, I was angry when the Nights Watch turned on Jon and murdered him, I was angry when Oberyn Martell died...I have been angry at a lot of things during this show.

&amp;#x200B;

However, who I was angry at has changed.

&amp;#x200B;

When they executed Lady, I was angry at Sansa for lying and Cersei for demanding Lady's death.

When they executed Ned, I was angry at Joffrey for being a sniveling little prick.

When Drogo died due to the witch, I was angry at Dany for being a twit demanding the women to be saved and going against Dothroki culture and I was angry at Drogo for going along with it.  I wasn't angry with the witch...she had her reasons.

When they massacred everyone at the Red Wedding, I was angry at the Freys, I was angry at the Boltons, and I was angry at Catelyn for all her stupid decisions that brought them there.

When the Night's Watch killed Jon, I was angry at them...and Ollie most of all.

When Oberyn Martell died, I was angry at him for delaying the killing blow.

&amp;#x200B;

I was angry at all these characters because they were all written fantastically and their actions made sense...even if I was angry at them because they killed off a character I really liked.  It was the characters actions that made me angry, and thus made me invested in the story.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately though...when something happens...I now get angry at the writers because the characters actions no longer make any sense.

I'm not angry at Arya for killing the Night King...I'm angry at the writers because it makes no sense.

I'm not angry at Dany for not seeing the ships that killed Rhaegal, I'm angry at the writers because ANYONE would be able to see a fleet of ships from that far up in the air.

I'm not angry at the characters that didn't die during the battle of winterfell...I'm angry at the writers for showing them in impossible situations and having them survive.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, Game Of Thrones has always made me angry...but it used to be in a good way that invested me into the show and interested in what happens next...I cared about the characters future, even the ones I hated.  But now I just don't care...nothing makes sense anymore so I no longer care what happens.  If Cersei wins, whatever...If Dany wins, whatever...If Jon wins, whatever...If Ghost sits on the Iron Throne, whatever.

Jon Targaryen. The Rightful Heir to the Seven Kingdoms.

Edit- For those wondering what this means to Dany's claim, Jon is ahead of her in succession. This is due to being the first born son of Rhaegar, as he was the first born son of Aerys. 

For those saying that by right of Conquest, that Robert usurped the Targaryen lineage. Upon his death, his ""children's"" deaths, and his brothers deaths as well, the true heir would go back to Jon (Stark) Targaryen, by way of Robert's grandmother being a Targaryen.

Back to Euron: Literally every time he's done anything in this show, it's always a card of ""surprise,"" it always rolls a 20, and there's never any logic to it. And Euron does it while half-drunk with a grin on his face making it look easy. This is just the laziest villain you could imagine for this show.",gameofthrones

904,"i really think drogon is the character that has the most sense in the episode. he didn’t kill jon for killing daenerys, instead, he destroys the one thing that caused all this tragedy in the first place. what a champ. i hope he lives a good life away from the bullshit that is westeros lol.

EDIT: whatever reason you think why drogon burned the throne in the end (whether it be because he knew that the throne caused dany’s death or because he thought she stabbed herself on one of the swords in it), you have to admit it’s a pretty poetic end to the throne. let people enjoy the goddamn show if they want to.

EDIT: this is my last edit, don’t worry. i’ve been receiving a lot of backlash and unnecessarily mean comments, and i understand why. but this show, like everything else, has always been open up to interpretation. whether it be the craziest, most questionable theory, to one that’s more believable — who are you to shun any speculation? the show has given us little to no information about a lot of things, in this case, a dragon’s intelligence, and they’ve recently been very inconsistent with lore. 

go ahead, feel free to debunk my little headcanon. that’s how discussion works, and i’m open to criticism. what i cannot stand is how extremely callous fans can be towards other fans who have opinions and mindsets different from what they believe. maybe it really is because of bad writing, but what do you have against people who try to put reason behind this?",gameofthrones
905,"This is my first reddit post, but after seeing the hate that episode 70 is getting (plot armor, night king died too easy, azor ahai), I wanted to throw in a few points I’ve notice, so bare with me. 

We have not been paying attention, this show has time and time again told us to expect the unexpected, to plan for every outcome. It’s told us that as much as you’ve believe you’re the hero, or the prince that was promised, or you’re special, you’re not. Fuck fate. 

No one is special. Beric was brought back to life some 16 time or so. And all that was so he could save a young woman in some hallways. The nK was supposed to destroy mankind and he was killed by the unexpected. A nobody to him. Fuck fate.

Jon was told he was the prince who was promised, he was brought back to life. He’s the hero of the show who wants to save people, and all he did throughout the episode was fail at that. He couldn’t stop the night king, he couldn’t save his friends. Fuck fate. 

Dany is the savior of the realm, the mother of dragons, and she is tossed to the ground to fight in the mud and blood, making her just another person fighting for their lives. It took Jorah by her side to protect her, which is fine because that’s all he’s ever wanted to do, and he succeeded. 

The plot armor you guys are complaining about, is just story telling. Each person alive still has a role to play against Cersei or for their own gain. 

You expected death for everyone and you didn’t get it.
You expected more from the night king and you didn’t get it. 
You expected an Azor Ahai and you didn’t get it. 

I have not known game of thrones to kill off key people in the midst of a battle. It’s always in small scuffles or when you don’t expect there to be any death. Deceit and trickery is the game, and the game is back on. Expect the unexpected.",gameofthrones

## [Spoilers] In this episode everyone faced their demons

The theme throughout this entire episode was succumbing to your demons, this wasn't just about Dany's madness, the coin flip landed for every character on the board

\-Cerci to her arrogance -Jamie to his love for Cerci -Sandor to his desire for revenge -Qyburn to his monster ala Frankenstein -Euron to his arrogance -Tyrion to his love for his family -Dany to her madness

Jon and Arya were also tested, Jon with his loyalty and Arya with her desire for revenge and their antithesis characters were greyworm and the hound. They represent the alternate path they could have chosen. Greyworm and Jon were faced with exactly the same choice at the same time just as Arya and the Hound were. Greyworm chose his loyalty to dany whereas Jon defied his loyalty to do the right thing, Arya chose to live rather than succumb to revenge as the hound did. All in all this episode was heavy with theme and I loved it for it.



Also another thing to note is that those who adapted against their demons survived. Arya and Jon did not succumb to theirs and they survived whereas the others who gave in died. I'm assuming Grey worm and Daenerys won't have a good time next episode.",gameofthrones
912,"I've rewatched this episode about 4 times now and just as I was on the first watch, on the second watch, third watch, fourth watch ,I'm certain. I've come to a conclusion.

**Only a character that was not on The Night King's Radar at all could've possibly killed him.**

Here is why:

Throughout the Episode *The Long Night*. The Night King keeps away from the battle until victory is all but assured. The people complaining about Arya killing him have completely ignored the context of the episode prior and everything of this character we've seen until this point.  Jaime said flat out last episode ""*The Night King Will never expose himself because his death is the only way the living win*. ""

And what does the Night King do the entire battle? He keeps any actual threat to him far away. He doesnt join the battle except to screw with the dragons to keep them out of the way.

He Does not go anywhere near any competent fighter with a weapon that's a serious threat to him, or any member of the Night's Watch. Not Brienne, Not Sam, not Jaime not Tormund, not Jorah, not Edd, Not Beric, not Sandor, and especially not Jon Snow.

The people upset expected this to be like a movie where the bad guy does bad guy stuff and the good guys win in a climactic battle, But this is an event that's been prophesized for literally millenia, The Night King **Has** to be aware that some destined, fabled hero is prophecized to destroy him. He is not mindless, he acts with cunning and purpose, he never speaks but he is far from stupid. 

So, if the Night King knows about the prophecy, and knows that Jon Snow likely fits the bill, and knows that Jon Snow has killed a white walker in single combat, and is a Dragon Rider, and all of these things that make him the perfect candidate for The Prince Who was Promised, What would he do? He would make absolutely certain Jon never gets within swinging distance.


Notice how when Jon approached him he just smirks at him and raises the dead around him, how he puts his dragon between him and the god's wood, how he makes sure that the defenders of winterfell are thoroughly occupied on the walls and courtyard so there's no chance of them being able to stop him. The Night King reacted like an intelligence being. 

But, this show has always been about the idea that things are never what they appear, and prophecy is never what you think it is. a Common theme in prophecy is that trying to prevent the future causes it to happen, and destiny cannot be averted, but also destiny is never what you want it to be. 

Theon dies, because He never stood a chance in single combat against the Night King, who let him exhaust himself fighting wights. 

But Arya has had time to rest, Arya only needs a shot, and Night King has never seen Arya before, she is No one. 

No one , but Azor Ahai can kill the Night King, if The Night King stops Azor Ahai Reborn from killing him, Then No one Will.


No one did. 

Death is the enemy, it's the first enemy and it's the last and in the end,      **It Always Wins** 

There's so many little hints that foreshadow this. Arya with the dagger, the image of the dagger appearing in one of sam's books, the little background info that it's forged from a piece of lightbringer, The scene in the godswood with her sneaking up on Jon. Bran's vision of the Night King's Creation.


The Night King is a man, turned into something else, but he is still a *man*.  

This is why Jaquen gave Arya that coin, not to turn her into some faceless assassin to kill Cersei, it's why they trained her, it's her entire purpose. Stop he who has cheated death with magic. Who has stolen from the God of Death over and over, whose very existence is an affront to death, because he is undying, and he robs the many faced god. put right that which the others have wronged. 


Jon is a **King**. Kings do not fight heroic climactic duels, they lead them into battle, they gather people, they move the pieces upon the board.  Jon fighting the Night King in single combat was never going to happen any more than Aragorn was going to fight Sauron in single combat. This is not that kind of story, it never was.


**Jon Is the one who first armed Arya, who started her on this path**

**Jon is the one who united the south and the north**

**Jon is who brought Daenarys and her Dragons making this Possible**

**Jon brought down the wildlings and made it possible for Bran to return home**

**Jon attacking winterfell is what made it possible to stage a defense there**

**Jon Snow is the King who put the pieces into play. He is not the champion who swings the final blow, he never was.**

It is elegant, simple, unexpected,  but perfectly fitting, and thematically appropriate. No other way of ending it would be so perfect.


Edit: Let me first say. The ending made perfect sense,was heavily foreshadowed not the entire episode was without flaw. But use a little critical thinking. 



Why Were the Trebuchets outside the Wall? 

Because you need to see what you're aiming at with a trebuchet and there's not enough room on top the walls of winterfell for them, outside was the only place to put them.

Why didnt they build a bigger trench?

Building a bigger trench would've dramatically increased the time it took to construct and they did not have that kind of time. Nor did they have time to build a second trench or they would have.


Why didnt they have more archers on the walls firing more constantly? 

They need to  be able to see what they're shooting at or they're just wasting ammunition which do not have an unlimited amount of.


Why did they charge the Dothraki into the enemy?

They probably didnt think it'd go that badly? I dunno that one did seem really stupid to me.


Why did they put the unsullied out there too?

To give cover to the trebuchet men outside the wall when falling back.


Why didnt they use more pitch and burning pots of oil?

They didn't have enough so they had to pick what was important (The Trench)


Why wasnt the Dragon able to melt that little rock Jon was hiding behind?

That's a good question, and if I had to come up with a BS answer it was the Dragon was injured and so couldnt produce hot enough flame due to his fucked up face? But that's an utter contrivance.


Why were so many main characters survive despite being surrounded by wights and thought to be dead multiple times? 

For most of them? Steel Armor is hard to get through when you're a hiveminded wight that's using inferior weapons and doesnt know how to get through it, Jaime, Brienne surviving at least makes sense to me, but I got nothing for the other, and tbh I really dont get how a stab to the chest when he's wearing steel plate is going to kill Jorah, that one also felt really BS.



""But Arya Rejected the whole No one thing when she left!""

Yeah, that's totally why they **Let her leave**. Not because she could convincingly play herself, nevermind that she's behaved **Really fucking weirdly** and continues to play the game of faces. It's pretty obvious based on her looks when no one is seeing her that like Bran, Arya's not really Arya anymore. Which is kinda the point, none of the Starks are quite who they were anymore, they're different, or someone new altogether. So many of these complaints just *miss the entire point*. Nah the Faceless men ,who engineered the destruction of valyria, totally didnt help point arya on this path and then let her leave after she rejected 'them' ,she totally wasnt manipulated into doing this from the start or anything.

If it's not spelled out for you in black and white. Yes there's continuity and realism flaws with some of the stuff, but that doesnt mean that everything in the episode is shit. 


But Why did Melisandre act as if she knew all along?

Acting like a smug know it all when she puts the pieces together at the last second is kinda Melisandre's thing. She did it to Stannis, she did it to Jon, now she's done it to Arya because it's what she does. She showed confidence and this ""I knew all along"" shit to her because what, she's going to, trying to encourage arya to go kill the night king act like she's just improvising and doesnt know this shit? Context matters.




Edit 2:

About the Dragons and those of you saying The Night King exposed himself to the Dragons thus making my point about him not exposing himself moot:


It's clear, based on the episode that no, Those Dragons were never any real threat to *Him*. The Dragons are a danger to his wight army, and would endanger his plan so he needed to get his dragon to pull them away from the battle and kite them up away from it. Dragonfire and Dragon Teeth and Claw can't hurt him any more than steel weapons can or fists can. Dragonglass and Valyrian Steel are the only things that we've seen can hurt a White Walker, anything else shatters on impact or loses it's heat as it gets close.  

So, Yes, the Night King exposes himself to things which are no danger to him at all. Your mistake is thinking of the Night King as if he is a regular dude.  He doesnt let Jon get close enough to him with his Valyrian Steel Sword, and puts up wights to give him room leave. 

Could some enterprising and clever archer put an arrow through his face and kill him? Possibly, we don't know because he made sure all the archers likely to take a shot at him were busy being overwhelmed by an army of the dead and desperately trying to save himself and his friends.  Could anyone have come and taken a shot at with a sword or an axe? Yeah probably and they would've ended up like Theon because he was walking with a bunch of White Walkers guarding him. The only moment he's not surrounded by either an undead dragon, wights, or white walkers is the briefest moment when Jon runs at him, and he raises the dead, or the moment he kills theon and he's about to kill Bran and has made way for it. That's when Arya Strikes


As some other Redditors have pointed out. The prophecy of Azor Ahai Reborn never once states he will beat the Night King, it says he will pull a sword from fire that shall be lightbringer, and The Darkness will run from him, and what does the Night King do to Jon? He sees him pull Longclaw from a burning building and kill a white walker with it. He sees him again and keeps his distance beyond the wall, putting wights between him and Jon. And a third time, he sees him and turns and leaves keeping obstacles between them. Jon IS Azor Ahai, But the prophecy was never about him destroying the Night King Personally.",gameofthrones
913,"Jon's story this season has been about his death.  Not the death of his body, which lasted a few episodes and about a single day in the in-universe timeline.  This season has been about the death of his spirit, a much more meaningful death than mere flesh.  The death of his spirit stretched out with pieces of Jon being chipped away until he had no hope, only fear and despair.  That despair comes to a head when Rickon dies in front of him, and its why he charged the Bolton lines all alone.  He wasn't fooled or lured out.  He was looking for an end.

'Battle of the Bastards' isn't a story about fighting to regain a home or a title.  **'Battle of the Bastards' is the story of Jon's resurrection.**

People who say that Jon hasn't noticeably changed by coming back from death have missed the change, because *they expected the change to be for the better*. Jon's behavior this season has been characterized by **fear.** Fear of death, certainly. But more than that is fear of not having a say in his own fate. Jon's life has mostly sucked for the past 5 years, and then he was murdered by his own men. That would make anybody afraid of the future, that all its going to be is more shit and misery. As he says to Sansa:

&gt;Jon: I'm tired of fighting. Its all I've done since I left Winterfell... I've fought, and I lost.

Jon shows that fear every time he is reminded that he can't control his own fate. When anybody mentions his death, he looks like a beaten dog. When Sansa wants to retake Winterfell, he wants nothing to do with it, and he only agrees to it when Sansa presses him with the knowledge that Ramsey has Rickon. Even when he agrees, he looks afraid, like he wants to be anywhere in the world other than where he is, or maybe be anybody other than *who* he is.

This leads to the discussions the night before the battle. In talking with Sansa its clear that Jon doesn't believe they'll win, but he doesn't have any other choice than to follow the path he is on.

&gt;Sansa: Its not enough!

&gt;Jon: No its not enough, its what we have!

This is followed by one of the most devastating exchanges I've ever seen on the show.

&gt;Sansa: I'm not going back there alive. Do you understand me?

&gt;Jon: I won't ever let him touch you again. I'll protect you, I promise.

&gt;Sansa: No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.

Setting aside what this says about Sansa's state of mind, this exchange is *devastating* to Jon's state of mind. **Protecting Sansa is the only task Jon has willingly embraced since dying.**  Jon is only at Winterfell because of Sansa and Rickon, and now Sansa has declared that he is powerless to do the one thing he wants to do: protect his family.

This declaration of Jon's powerlessness is followed by his conversation with Melisandre where he asks Mel not to bring him back if he dies. Thats Jon trying to gain power over at least one thing: the ability to have it all end for good, and not be forced back into the shit and misery again. Mel won't even give him that, because she has to try, and its up to the Lord of Light as to whether or not Jon is brought back.

&gt;Mel: Maybe he brought you here to die again.

&gt;Jon: What kind of god would do something like that?

&gt;Mel: The one we've got.

At this point, Jon has control over nothing. He can't protect his family, he's on the verge of a battle he never wanted, he doesn't have enough men to have any real control over whether they win or lose, and he can't even trust that death will bring it all to an end. His hope for the future is hanging on by a thread.

Then Ramsey lets Rickon run across the field. Forget all that ""Jon is a Stark who is loyal to his family"" stuff. This is much simpler. The only thing Jon is living for at this moment is to protect the two family members he can. One of them just denied that he can protect her. The other one is running across the field with arrows flying down.  When Rickon starts running across the field, there is only one thing left for Jon: protect his little brother. He has no power, only the thread of hope that he can do that.

Rickon dies, and the screen darkens as the camera looks down at him from Jon's perspective. When Jon looks at Ramsey its not with anger but with despair. **The gods keep pouring shit down on Jon, and spat in the face of the last bit of hope he had.**

Thats why he charges. True, there were arrows coming down that he was trying to outrun, but they were being released in volleys; he could have tried turning around and escaping between volleys. But he wasn't trying to escape the arrows, or lead his men to victory, or kill Ramsey. He was charging as a challenge to the gods, either to keep him alive or let him die in peace. When his horse goes down, he thinks he has an answer: the gods didn't bring him there to magically pull out a victory, they really did bring him there just to die again. But at the very last second his own men catch up, and he has to fight.

As the battle progresses, he finds himself buried beneath the bodies, the metaphor of the gods pouring misery down on his head suddenly becoming literal. He could have stopped there, give up and suffocate beneath the weight. Thats what makes the 'rebirth' scene so powerful: he claws his way back out and *declares that he wants to live*. Even Kit Harington describes the scene [this way](http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/682554/Game-of-Thrones-Kit-Harington-Jon-Snow-Daenerys-Targaryen):

&gt;“When the crush starts happening, he slows down, and there's that thing of peace where he thinks: 'I could just stay here and let it all end.’ ""And then something drives him to fight up, and that moment when he comes up and grasps for breath, he is reborn again. . .""

After a season where Jon has wanted to run away, a season of fear and worry, a season where he has no control, he declares in the face of all of it that he still wants to live. This is followed almost immediately by defeat turning into victory, with the gods sending salvation in the form of saviors from the Vale. When Jon climbs over the bodies and stares down Ramsey, he has a look in his eyes he hasn't had all season, one that I don't think he's ever had on the show: the look of absolute intent, a man who knows what he wants and is about to go take it.

This season has been about Jon's death. First the death of his body. Then the death of his belief, and the death of his will. Then finally the death of his hope.

Only in the final minutes of 'Battle of the Bastards' has Jon truly returned to life, and now we'll finally see the change that everybody expected back when life returned to his body.

Jon always had the ice. Now he has the fire.",gameofthrones

From Euron’s point of view, Tyrion should have no knowledge that Cersei is pregnant - Tyrion was up in the North when he slept with Cersei for the first time. 

It might not have been intentional on Tyrion’s part, but I think that Euron might realize that Cersei’s baby isn’t his, turn on Cersei, and potentially kill her. If Tyrion realized what he was doing, he hid it well. If not, it may unintentionally have huge payoffs for Dany, and likely be his most “clever” move yet.

928,"**The motivation of the Night King:**
This was clearly explained in the show. The Night King was created by the CotF to kill human, that's what he was trying to do. He wanted an endless night and to erase all memory of human. That's exactly what he was trying to do. I think we were just expecting some crazy twist to happen, but at least it make sense with what was said in the show. I prefer something simple that make sense with the story, that something crazy that will make no sense when rewatching all the seasons.


**Arya killing the Night King:**
*""Green eye, brown eye, blue eye. Eyes you will close forever.""* This was foreshadow in S3.
Her whole story was around the God of Death. And Death is literally the Night King in the story. Also, Bran gave her the dagger in S7. So it was pretty clear that Arya was meant to kill the Night King. Again, I think we just expected some crazy shit like Bran going in the past and fucking around some timelines, which 90% of the viewers would have no idea WTF just happened.


**The Army of the Dead dealt in Ep3:**
They filmed for 50+ nights to created the longest and most promising episode of the serie. They put everything on the table for this episode. There's no way the AotD would have survived this episode. Because if they survived, this mean that we need another bigger battle to defeat them. And with all the casualties, there's no logic way to make the living survive. Also, I don't see how Jon and co could have escaped the battle alive and I don't see the Night King retreating either. So, it had to end here. The AotD won at the Fist of the First Man, at Hardhome and Beyond the Wall, but they were defeated in Winterfell, because *everyone* decided to fight together. I don't feel like this has been rushed. This battle has been build up for 8 Seasons and it ended with the biggest episode ever produced.

Anyway, just my two cents. I think the plot was simpler that some of the hardcore fans wanted, but at least it make sense with the narrative and the final battle was truly epic.",gameofthrones

In the scene where Yara is being held hostage, and Theon is looking around, you can see Euron's men cutting the tongues from the crew.

So Beric is a ""fire wight"". And thats obviously foreshadowing something. The big question is, if the Night King animates the ice wights, who then animates the fire wights?

Here are the **Facts**:

1. Bran is a powerful warg. We know he gets visions of the past, present and future…and can manipulate the past to help save his future self. We don't yet know the extent of this power.  

2. We knew the Night King can reanimate the dead into evil still-dead soldiers. But this episode we learned he can also manipulate snow and ice at will, sending a full blown blizzard. (This is key.)

3.  Followers of the Lord of Light believe that their Lord is always at war with his evil opposite diety. Theres always a dichotomy. Light vs Dark. Good vs Bad. Fire vs Ice. Everything in this world has an antithesis. 

4. The 3 eyed raven seems to be NK's eternal adversary. He intentionally killed the OG 3 eyed raven, and ever since he's been after Bran. 

5. The lord of light supposedly has a ""purpose"" for everyone. Consequently, everyone supposedly brought back by the lord of light helped Arya defeat the Night King.

6. Bran gave Arya the dagger, and offered himself as bait. So like the Lord of Light, everything Bran has done recently also ultimately leads to Arya defeating the Night King.
	
What we can take from this…

- If the Night King is Lord of Death, Night, and Ice…he should have an equal opposite. That opposite would of course be the Lord of Life, Light, and Fire  (ie. The Lord of Light) . 

- The Night King is a physical entity, his opposite should be too. The Lord of Light likely has a physical presence (or a physical champion at the very least). So who is it? they don't ever explicitly show any other being with NK's level of power (or do they?)

- If the Night King can reanimate the dead, his ""light"" opposite should have an equal level of power to bring life.  And if NK's reanimated dead fight for evil, then his opposite's reanimated dead would fight for good/the living. 

- George R.R. Martin confirmed this logic, with his mentioning the existence of the ""Fire Wight"". Beric, Jon, (and maybe the Hound) are one of them. So the above theory that the Lord of Light is the NK's opposite holds water

- If the NK can manifest snow and ice at will. Then his opposite should be able to manifest fire at will. And maybe...communicate with others through it.

- Bran and the Lord of Light are working towards the same goal. 

- The 3 Eyed Raven is the NK's ultimate adversary….the force hes always at battle with.
  
The simplest explanation to all of this ...The 3 Eyed Raven is the Night King's opposite. The NK's opposite is the Lord of Light. Therefore, Bran = the Lord of Light (or at least what people think is the Lord of Light due to the signs he brings)

So how does this play out?

**********************************************
**The Dagger Arch**

First consider the dagger.

The entire storyline from Season 1 on revolves around the dagger. And the entire dagger story is intrinsically linked to Bran. 

We also know the dagger is ancient, as it appears in Sam's book.  Its been passed down from generation to generation, as all existing Valerian steel has been. https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/97/Valyrian_steel_dagger_game_of_thrones_catspaw_blade_sam.png/revision/latest?cb=20170723084654

We don't actually know for sure who owned the dagger, or where the assassin got it. Littlefinger claims it was his but later denies it. Even if it was Littlefinger's, its never explained where he got it. This is important.

**********************************************

**The Theory**

It all but obvious at this point, Bran has been manipulating the plotline the entire time. He knew exactly how the battle was going to end. He knew exactly how to kill the Night King, because he set the trap himself. While warging during the battle, he was likely manipulating events to lead to the final conclusion.

 Everything he has done has revolved around getting the dagger to Arya and getting her safely to the NK. That plan was set in motion all the way back in Season 1. 

Future Bran made sure that dagger was sent to kill his childhood self. He put the key piece in play. He then warged into Summer to kill the assassin. 

 Farther back than that, the dagger may have belonged to Aerys Targarian (passed down through their family), and Bran messed with him to make sure it got where it needed to go. (Maybe Jaime or Littlefinger picked it up after the Mad King was slain).

It’s possible the dagger was even forged originally for the purpose of killing the Night King thousands of years later.

Arya's training was also crucial/pre-planned. She would have never trained to kill without....1) Bran's assassination attempt being pinned on Tyrion (because of the dagger). And 2) King Robert's Death. 

We already know how he could have manipulated the assassination. He could have also been warged into the wild boar that killed King Robert, if it were for the good of the realm.

Melesandre told Arya last episode what Syrio Forel told her before he was killed, ""What do we say to the god of death? Not today"". Homage to the fact that her training was all destined from the beginning. 

All of the war and death that was sparked because of Bran. He knew it would happen, but he saw how the alternative story lines would play out, where the Night King wins. He sacrificed whoever he had to for the good of the realm. Much like lord Varys (who he spoke to through the flames after he was cut)

All of the ""magical Lord of Light moments"" that are supposedly the God's work, are actually Bran manipulating the past, resurrecting people and making sure Arya got the knife and made it to kill NK.

- Beric getting brought back to life so many times….it wasn't the shitty priest saying a prayer. Both he and Melesandre said he shouldn't have that power. In fact, it was Bran bringing him back to life so he could help Arya during the battle. 

- The hound surviving. Septon Ray told him he thought he was a corpse. He also told him that he pretty much died multiple times while he was recovering, but he kept coming back to life. After he comes back to life, he's fighting for good.  Again, hound ended up a key figure in getting Arya to the NK. 
	
- Jon coming back. No evidence again to suggest Melesandre's prayer did it. She completely gave up, and he didn't come back to life until a while after.

- The trench lighting on fire…again, it didn't seem to be Melesandre's words that did it. You could see she was getting frustrated/confused when it wasn't working at first. It was actually Bran summoning fire.

- Lord Varys hearing the voice in the flames after he was cut....which is said to be what lead to him ending up in King's Landing and rising to power. After that scene with the priestess in the Pyramid, it cut to Bran’s face. 

We know Bran is the most powerful living being other than the Night King. We know both he and the Lord of Light are working towards the same goal, and both manipulate the storyline. 

It makes sense that Bran is the Lord of light, and all past 3 Eyed Ravens were also the Lord of Light.  Or at the very least they’re representatives of him .

Where was Bran during the battle? Making shit happen. This would make the Night King's death wayyy less anticlimactic than it was. 

Some  interesting questions then come up if this all plays out. When the Whites die, their wights they turned die. 

If Bran dies, does Jon automatically die too?

Now that the Night King is dead, whos the Lord of Light's new opposite to balance out the dichotomy? (Cersei? Danny? perhaps)

**************************
**Further Evidence**

- Bran's powers are strongest by the Weirwood trees. Aka the ""Heart Trees"" The trees were worshiped by the First Men (and Children of the forest?) as gods.  They're known as ""Heart Trees"".   The lord of light is also known as the ""Heart of Fire"", with a symbolic heart.

- The Children of the Forest brought back Benjen as a fire-wielding fire wight. They're obviously the key to the power of both the NK and the Lord of Light. They could have created the 3 eyed raven/LoL the same as they created the NK as a counter balance

- Bran (or the OG 3 eyed raven) are likely who drove Aerys II Targaryen mad, whispering for him to ""Burn them all"". He's been fighting the future battle from the past for a long time. 
 
- In the episode followup commentary, they implied they randomly picked Arya to kill the NK at some point; and wove the episode to heighten the surprise. Its hard to believe that decision was really random",gameofthrones
932,"The Mad Queen descent was rushed, but I've seen a lot of people all over the Internet make fun of the bells and at Daenerys' mind breaking at the point of surrender but it made sense and was set up earlier in the episode.

Season 1 to 7 showed up a Daenerys that rose from the very lowest of lows to the height of power. In Season 1 and 2, we see Daenerys realize that without power, no one will respect her or take her claim seriously. She’s told repeatedly that she’s nothing without an army, and she’s nothing without ships. She gains those. We cheer for her.

**When Daenerys leaves Essos, she thinks she can rule through compassion and be** ***loved*** **by the people once she gets rid of Cersei.** She had her armies. She had dragons. She had powerful allies in Westeros. She had the strongest claim to the throne and finally had the chance to take King’s Landing.

Season 7 and Season 8 was about losing that power. First, her powerful allies are stripped away one by one. Olenna, Elliria, Yara. Tyrion mismanages them as Hand of the Queen and makes horrible tactical mistakes.

**In S08E01, Daenerys realizes she doesn’t have the love of the people.** In Essos, she broke their chains and earned their devotion and became their Mysha. She freed them from their oppressive masters and they were grateful to her and made her their queen. In the North, Sansa and Jon had already broken their chains. They defeated Ramsay. Sansa and Jon, as Starks, have earned their loyalty for a lifetime. Daenerys is faced with a smallfolk — her subjects — that don’t love her. It’s a harsh realization for her.

**In S08E02, she loses her claim.** Jon tells her his true identity, and suddenly she’s not the only Targaryen in the world. Even moreso, Jon’s claim is stronger. He’s a natural leader. She’s immediately threatened by his confession, and is shaken by it.

**In S08E03, she loses Jorah.** He was there for her since the beginning. He was devoted to her not because of her power, not because of her dragons, but because he loved her. He never would’ve betrayed her and she trusted him fully. He’s essentially been her rock through all her hardship. And then he dies protecting her.

**In S08E04, she loses her second child, and Missandei. O**ne by one, everyone she held close that was devoted to her and her alone was taken from her. Her dragons were a symbol of her power; with only one left, she was beginning to get desperate. Her only advisor from Essos was Grey Worm, and he was a soldier.

**In S08E05, she loses Varys, Tyrion, and Jon**. Through betrayal, no less. Jon betrays her by telling Sansa, and Sansa tells Tyrion, who tells Varys. Varys openly conspires against her and (presumably) tries to poison her and turn Jon against her. She kills him without a trial, without asking for his last words, and without a second thought. At that point, she’s on the brink.

And Jon goes to her, and she seeks one last bit of comfort from him. She tells him that people love him, and that’s something she’ll never have.

&gt;**”Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don’t have love here. I only have fear.”**

He counters by saying that he loves her, and that she’ll always be his queen. But when they kiss, Daenerys realizes that he’ll never truly love her again. And so, she says: **""Alright then. Let it be fear""**

When the bells ring, **Daenerys realizes that while the city has surrendered she’ll never be secure as queen as long as the people don’t truly, irrevocably fear her.** **She will never be loved by them.** She has lost everything she has gained and every friend she’s made, and she’s completely alone. King’s Landing becomes a symbol of everything she’s ever been through — her brother selling her like a brood mare, Drogo's death, being ridiculed and laughed at from Pentos to Slaver's Bay to Mereen, being threatened at every turn, losing her dragons, losing her loved ones. She’s on her dragon, she’s alone, she feels powerless, and she’s *angry*.

So what does she do when feels powerless? She reminds them all that she is still powerful. The people will never love her, so they will fear her.",gameofthrones

Also Euron does not deserve to kill a dragon. I get that he was pretty cool in the books, but he’s only fun as a foil character at best in the shows. I mean he’s kinda funny... but he’s not dragon killing material. Also wtf is wardrobe thinking, just dressing him like a steampunk?!

939,"As a disclaimer, I'm only here to talk about what this episode made me realize and why I loved the way it turned out. 

I loved that today they showed me that all my preconceptions were wrong. 

This story is about how us humans are the real threat. To our world and to ourselves, it's purpose was never to be a pure fantasy story. Sure the NK's arc needed better closure, but in the end he wasn't the real threat. 

Arya isn't a super killer girl. Today they showed us a powerless and scared Arya. all her training has no match to an insane tyrant. 

They showed us Cersei at her most vulnerable, we all thought this was going to be a showdown between Cersei and Dany. Cersei never stood a chance. 

Jon is supposed to be someone who knows what is right and always wants what's best for everyone. It was heartbreaking watching him realize he was wrong and what following his heart led to. 

I could go on with more examples but I'll close out by saying I'm just overwhelmed at how powerful this episode was at showing us the fear of what a tyrant that is thirsty for power is like.

Edit: Thank you everyone for sharing your views and for the gold! It was great to see everyone's thoughts on other characters such as Cersei (sorry for the spelling, fixed!), Grey worm, Varys, Dany and others.

...because he knows she’s lying. And her reaction shows that she *knows* he knows she’s lying. All she’s ever wanted is to use her strength and skill to serve and protect...AKA to be a knight. And Pod knows it. 

Then when Jaime tells her to kneel, she scoffs at first. But then she looks back at Pod, and this time he gives her that subtle smile that seems to say, “Yes my lady, this is right.” And that convinces her.

Before you debbie downers come and tell us all how it was garbage, I loved this episode, okay??!!

So these are my FRESH thoughts without anyone's influence on them and without thinking too much about it:

&amp;#x200B;

* Varys' death -&gt; Made perfect sense.  Made also sense for Tyrion to save himself by giving him up
* Mad Queen Dany -&gt; We've been telling you this for a while now.  Is anyone really surprised?
* Battle -&gt; Didn't make one lick of sense.  Basically before the bells she had already won without engaging a single one of her troups.  Drogon did it all.  Don't care.  Was fun to see just how much damage a dragon can do.
* Euron's end-&gt; Meh but don't care.  Cool last words and died with a fucker's smile on his face
* Jaime &amp; Cercie's end -&gt; Human.  Touching. Great acting.  Loved it
* CLEGANE BOWL -&gt; If one of you fuckers complain about finally getting glegane bowl...  Fitting how it was fire in the end
* Arya -&gt; I cried when she called him Sandor.  The shots of her trying to escape the city were REALLY intense.  Loved every bit of it.  The horse bit was a bit strange but I'm down to be okay with that.
* Jon -&gt; Good of Jon to realize just how mad everything is going
* Tyrion -&gt; Always good to have Tyrion/Jaime scenes.  I cried a lot.

960,"The only way what happened this episode can make any sense is if Sansa was behind it all.

We can see Sansa’s look of fear when she realizes that Dany started to play the game(Gendry’s scene)

After Bran reveals Jon’s identity She tries to convince Jon to take the iron throne but he wouldn’t listen. What would she do next? 

1 - First turn Dany’s people against her. By planting a seed of doubt in Tyrion’s head , it will either make him question her legitimacy or atleast talk about it to Varys. This could start a domino effect that will turn Dany into a full tyrant further illegitimatizing her claim to the iron throne.

2 - Second send a raven to Cersei that Dany is on her way to Dragonstone.

a - Dany’s fleet has no northerns on it.

b - Neither of them will grant the North its independence if they win, so to Sansa they’re both the same except one of them has two dragons.

c - If Cersei defeats Dany in the black water bay then the Northern army are all intact , Sansa can’t afford anymore losses in her armies.



3 - Third thing she does is to send her Assassin sister down to kings landing to kill Cersei. I don’t think Arya would wait for Sansa to tell her to go kill Cersei but i also don’t think she would leave without saying goodbye and i bet Sansa gave Arya alot of ideas as to how to kill Cersei because she knows Cersei better than her.


So in conclusion Sansa’s objective is to sabotage Dany, helping Cersei to win and end the war very quickly so the North doesn’t suffer any more losses and then assassinate Cersei. 

Jon will have no option but to step up and be the king of the seven kingdoms.

Sansa learned alot from little finger , she’s playing all the possibilities in her head and she expects the worst from anyone who’s not a Stark or a half Stark! 

She also learned alot from Cersei ! If you think about it , both their plans are very similar ,

964,"First off, I enjoyed S8E3. I understand the flaws with the battle tactics and the seemingly infinite plot armor of the major characters, but it’s a TV show. 

After the episode, several book reader friends were asking if this meant Arya was Azor Ahai. Their reasoning was that she killed the Night King, therefor she must be Azor Ahai. I saw several posts saying the same thing. Many redditors were angry about this, feeling that D&amp;D were straying from Martin’s outline just to subvert expectations. 

But this logic – whoever kills the Night King = Azor Ahai – stems from years of theory drift. Few have paid attention to what Azor Ahai actually did and what he/she is meant to do the second time around. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the original **legend** of Azor Ahai per Chapter 10, ACOK:

&amp;#x200B;

*“Darkness lay over the world and a hero, Azor Ahai, was chosen to fight against it. To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.*

*The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.* 

*The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes.”*

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, the purpose of this legend is to explain Valyrian Steel, but this isn’t too important. What is important is that this is a legend, not a prophecy. These events are not predicted to happen again. Jon Snow does not need to thrust his sword in Danny to turn Longclaw into Lightbringer. Gendry, being a blacksmith, is not any more likely to be the next Azor Ahai. This is all in the past. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is the **prophecy** of Azor Ahai, per Chapter 10, ACOK:

&amp;#x200B;

*“There will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed, and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.”*

&amp;#x200B;

A hero is meant to draw a sword from a fire and that sword will be Lightbringer. The warrior who draws it from the fire will be Azor Ahai, and the darkness will flee from him. It doesn’t read like Azor Ahai is a specific person chosen by destiny, but a role that will be filled. Azor Ahai will be whoever demonstrates to the darkness that it can be defeated. Whoever does this will cause darkness to flee. 

This is Jon Snow. It already happened. Not in S8E3 but in S5E8 – Hardhome.

At the end of Hardhome, Jon Snow drew Longclaw from a burning building and promptly killed a Wight Walker. In this moment, the Night King – the manifestation of darkness in the show, looks challenged for the first time. The episode ends with the Night King raising the dead while he stares down Jon. Jon has become a threat to him.

The end of the prophecy is realized at the end of S8E3. The Night King stands his ground with Drogon and Theon. He sees neither of them, nor anyone else, as threats. But when Jon comes chasing after him, what does the Night King do? He flees. He raises the dead and he runs (walks) away. He won’t face Jon. 

Jon Snow is Azor Ahai and fulfills the prophecy.",gameofthrones
965,"I think it's likely Bronn will switch sides and join Dany through Tyrion. He basically states this directly when he tells Jamie something along the lines of ""our relationship ends with dragons.""

However, Bronn is still a sell-sword and will likely call upon Tyrion's original promise to him in order to join his side - if anyone offers Bronn more money to betray him, Tyrion will double the fee. Bronn is owed a castle by the Jamie and Cersei so Tyrion would have to give Bronn two castles to honor the agreement.

##TL;DR: If Jon takes the North/Vale army to fight the Night King, he will ruin the checkmate that Littlefinger has spent years setting up... using that same army to install Sansa as his puppet on the Iron Throne once the Cersei/Daenerys war leaves his enemies too weakened to resist him. Littlefinger's current moves at Winterfell, including his murky interactions with Arya and Bran, serve his greater purpose of ousting Jon before the army moves out.
---

Littlefinger wants Sansa and the Iron Throne; Jon is the roadblock in the way of both goals.

Littlefinger’s already told us what his basic strategy is; he lets his enemies destroy each other for him while he acquires more territory and an ever-larger army. Adding the North to his pile is his next step, and while he seems to be sitting around Winterfell twiddling his thumbs, he’s actually positioned exactly where he wants to be, with a fantastic excuse for staying out of the fiery bloodbath to the south. 

While Littlefinger and his army are parked safely at Winterfell, his rivals are dropping like flies: the Martells and Tyrells are gone, half the Greyjoy fleet just sunk the other half, and Team Cersei and Team Daenerys are hacking away huge chunks of each other’s military might every time they clash.

In Littlefinger's plan, it doesn’t matter much whether it’s Cersei or Daenerys who wins; whichever one sits on the Iron Throne at the end will do so with heavy martial losses and a serious public relations problem. People hated Targaryens before one unleashed a Dothraki horde and burninated the countryside… and they hated Cersei before she blew up their religion and strutted around pregnant with her brother’s baby, thus proving the rumors true that Joffrey and Tommen were never legitimate kings.

And just imagine... into this mess rides the Queen in the North, trueborn supermodel daughter of the famously noble, recently vindicated Ned Stark, with the united armies (and food!) of the North, the Vale, and the Riverlands behind her, to be hailed as the liberator of the Seven Kingdoms. It would be sweet justice immortalized in a thousand songs. Once Littlefinger has Sansa installed, Littlefinger can either be the power behind the throne or marry her to claim it himself.

But then Jon threw a wrench in this plan by not dying during the Battle of the Bastards... and another by being so impressive that no one in the North cared that Sansa outranked him... and yet another when he crowned himself King of the Cockblock.

But to Littlefinger, there’s something even worse and more dangerous about Jon: if Jon isn’t stopped soon, Jon is going to completely destroy Littlefinger's throne-taking army by marching it north to die fighting magical snow zombies.

So when Bran shows up, Littlefinger tries to turn him into an asset. Bran is physically weak and seems like he might have some mental problems to boot; at first glance, he seems like he might be as easy to manipulate as Sweetrobin. That could even be a sweet shortcut for Littlefinger; instead of having to painstakingly chip away at Sansa’s defenses, he could just get Bran to *command* Sansa to marry him.

So Littlefinger gives Bran a neat present, tries to ingratiate himself, and starts working the “Hey, y’know, YOU’RE the rightful Lord of Winterfell, not that bastard brother of yours” angle. If he can get Bran to challenge Jon, either outcome is a win; even if Jon stays in power, Jon will take a massive hit to his reputation and the loyalty of his Stark-sworn bannermen.

But instead, of course, Bran looks right through Littlefinger and tells him that “chaos is a ladder”. And while it’s plenty unsettling on the “I know about shit you said to Varys in private” level, it also implies that Bran knows exactly what Littlefinger is trying to do at Winterfell… create chaos so that he can climb the ladder.

And now Arya shows up. And Arya is a problem. Not just because Littlefinger recognizes that fighting style, but because any of the folks currently at Winterfell who spent time around the Stark kids before the war could have told him that Arya and Jon were best buddies. That’d be dangerous to have around even before you threw Arya’s currently unknown badass capabilities into the mix.

But if Littlefinger can set up a situation where Sansa and Arya are at odds with each other, the potential benefits to him are huge: 

Right now, if Littlefinger tried to poison Sansa against Jon, Arya could talk some sense into her… but Arya will lose all her power to do that if Sansa no longer trusts her.

If Arya thinks Sansa is plotting against Jon, Arya would likely start undermining Sansa… and since Sansa is actually trying to *help* Jon, Arya will be making Jon’s situation worse. And if Sansa finds out, they’d be even madder at each other.

Moreover, if shit goes down before Jon returns, he’d be asked to choose sides… either pissing off a terrifying little No One, or the woman half his army are more loyal to than him. 

And maybe more importantly than any of that in Littlefinger's eyes, the situation has the potential to cause Sansa to feel utter despair. For years, Sansa has longed to go home, to escape backstabbing and intrigue and return to a place where she can truly feel safe, surrounded by love and honesty. If Sansa has *finally* gotten back to Winterfell, *finally* gotten back to the Starks, only to have the Bran-bot stare at a tree while Jon and Arya betray her... after everything Sansa's been through, *that* could be the thing that truly breaks her and sends her running into Littlefinger's arms.

So with all those potential benefits held in his mind, Littlefinger’s doing what he was already planning to do… exploit Jon’s absence to sow doubt among Jon’s bannermen and try to flip their loyalty over to Sansa… while attempting to set up Arya to believe that it was Sansa’s idea.

That scene we witnessed, with Littlefinger talking so earnestly to ~~the young Karstark heir~~ *the random young girl that totally wasn't Karstark, my bad*? I suspect he’s going to use her to frame Arya to Sansa just as he framed Sansa to Arya.

And then, please, PLEASE, let Littlefinger have underestimated one or all of them and die in some immensely satisfying, karmic retribution way.

P.S. Just to clarify, since I've gotten a lot of messages about this... this isn't what I think is actually going to happen on the show. This is just what I think Littlefinger is plotting. 

---

**Edited to add:** 

*Just realized that Littlefinger's under another deadline as well. He needs to depose Jon before Jon returns, because there's a chance that Jon has successfully allied with Daenerys, which would also screw up Littlefinger's plans.*

*It's possible that Littlefinger was betting that Daenerys would kill/imprison Jon. It's also possible that Littlefinger is hedging that bet; it's been strongly implied that Littlefinger has figured out who Jon's parents actually are. If Jon comes back allied with Daenerys, Littlefinger might choose that moment to spill those beans, expecting that the revelation will weaken the loyalty of Jon's bannermen and make them suspicious of Jon's motives.*

*And since a lot of folks have messaged to ask:*

**How could Littlefinger recognize Arya’s Braavosi fighting style?**

*House Baelish originated in Braavos, but even more than that, Littlefinger was Robert’s Master of Coin; he would have spent years with one of his primary duties being to negotiate with the Iron Bank of Braavos. He likely spent time there, or at least researched what he could expect if he pissed them off too much.*

**How could Littlefinger figure out that R + L = J?**

*The driving obsession of Littlefinger’s life has been his love for Catelyn. His #1 tactic for getting what he wants is finding weaknesses and exploiting them. The otherwise rock-solid marriage of Ned and Catelyn had one exploitable weakness that Littlefinger would certainly have known about through Lysa: Catelyn’s resentment over Jon.*

*It would be insanely out of character for Littlefinger not to dig up every speck of dirt about Jon’s origins that he could… especially when you consider that the #1 theory in Westeros about Jon’s mother (in the books, anyway) is that she was the insanely gorgeous Ashara Dayne, rumored to be the actual love of Ned’s life. If Littlefinger could have proved that was true, he would have had massive ammunition with which to poison Catelyn’s marriage.*

*Investigating the Daynes would have revealed that Ned showed up at Starfall with Lyanna’s corpse and a suspiciously newborn Jon to return Arthur Dayne’s sword. That would not have been difficult math for Littlefinger to do.*

*And Littlefinger would have excellent motive to keep the secret. The last thing he’d want to do is tell Catelyn that her husband didn’t cheat on her and was even more noble than she ever suspected.*

976,"during that Winterfell dining hall scene. A lot of people interpreted that as her feeling jealous of Jon and getting activated as the mad queen. Maybe there is some of that too. But I read that scene mostly as her feeling isolated and lonely in a room full of people. It's a sad sad feeling. She quietly watched Jon getting adored by the notherners and Lannister brothers bonding with Brienne and Pod. Everyone had somebody by their side - family or friend. Dany had no one by her side, she just sat there all alone feeling like she had no one to belong with.

I have not read the books, but her show arc has been about finding home, somewhere she truly belongs. That's what she was indoctrinated by her brother. Dany grew up in Essos, but always longed to go back home. She couldn't integrate there completely though she did really well with the Dothrakis by embracing (most of) their customs and language. She continuously failed to understand and accept the cultural differences in the other Essos cities she conquered. She struggled between pleasing people and sticking to her principles and that led to her making some very questionable decisions.

Now she's finally made it to  Westeros and does not feel at home here either. In S7, she said to Tyrion (IIRC) that Dragonstone does not feel like home. In the north she got (understandably) cold shouldered both before and after she fought alongside the northerners. Sansa had to reminded by Arya that Dany played an important role in this battle against the NK. Dany got a toast from Tormund, but eventually Jon was the one getting all the attention and accolades. She just wants to be loved by her people. This came up later in her conversation with Jon.

The girl has literally no support system left. She lost Jorah, and has most likely lost Jon as her partner. Her second child got murdered. Now Missandei who was like her soulmate was executed right in front of her. This was her final trigger to becoming the mad queen, but at least we are getting to see a legitimate set up to her transformation.

977,"This is a petition for Angela Tyrpak, my best friends (Derrick) Fiancé. She’s been diagnosed with colon cancer and has been given the next 2-3 months to live. 

Upon receiving her diagnosis and leaving the hospital she explained to Derrick, “I better live to see the end of GOT”. 
It broke my heart to hear someone get that short of a timeline and have her priorities be to just see the end of her favorite show. As the timeline she was given comes just short (I know the timelines are rough and people can make it a lot longer than what a  Dr can provide) of the premier, we are not sure if she’ll be able to see it. 

I don’t know if this will be of any use but I thought that maybe if this gets enough attention she will be able to get her final wish. 

Edit 1:Thank you all for the kind words, just be your comments you’ve made her day! 

Here is the petition to sign! https://www.change.org/p/hbo-woman-with-colon-cancer-to-see-final-season-of-got-early?recruiter=627873605&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=share_petition&amp;utm_term=tap_basic_sharehttps://

Edit 2: Angela, Derrick and I want to thank you all so much who have shared your kind words and generosity. She is absolutely thrilled with the progress of the petition and the growth of this post. You are all amazing. I tried to get to everyone today and I’ll pick up again tomorrow after some sleep. Thanks again from the bottom of our hearts. 

Edit 3: Wow you guys and gals, this thing has really taken off. Angela finds so much joy reading your comments. I will do my best to keep up with all the comments, I have work and other responsibilities I will try to balance but for Angela, I will keep responding any chance I can. 
She’s not getting her hopes up but we’re crossing our fingers. The petition is doing so well because of you guys and it’s so moving. You are all heroes. 

Also for the gold, thank you strangers. I will use it well. 

Edit 4: A message from Angela:

“Hi everyone, this is Angela Tyrpak. I’m sorry it’s taken me so long to respond, but this is all kind of new to me. Your overwhelming support for a total stranger has truly humbled me.  I know that we all know I have a slim to zero chance of seeing the ending, but having your support is almost better than that. 

So once again, I do thank you. I’m humbled by you, and appreciate you taking the time to participate.”

Edit 5: It is with a heavy heart that I have to inform you all Angela has past away. She got to see the first episode and enjoyed it but from that point on she would forget watching the episodes or just not have the energy too. She was moved to a hospital and shortly after she passed in the middle of the day. 

She was so incredibly moved by the outcry and support this post got and both her and Derrick were incredibly grateful for your kindness. Thank you all.",gameofthrones

979,"For Cersei, Jon not only is Ned's 'bastard' who became King in the North but much more and she doesn't even know that.

When Tywin Lannister was Hand of the King to Mad King Aerys, he wanted his daughter Cersei to be married to Prince Rhaegar but Aerys refused and married Rhaegar to Ellia Martell.

Cersei always fancied and wanted to marry Prince Rhaegar.
She even asked Maggy the witch ""will I marry the Prince?"". 
Maggy the witch replied ""No,You will marry the King"".

Now Cersei did marry the King and that King was Robert Baratheon. We know that he was to marry Lyanna Stark.He loved her even after her death and never loved Cersei.

So Jon is basically the son of the Prince she always wanted to marry and the woman her husband loved till his death.

980,"ASOIAF is an anti-war story. It's about the foolish and futile behaviour of man, fighting for power, while a real and existential threat looms.

No matter which King or Queen sits on the throne, nothing changes, and people die in the process.

And Death doesn't care what House a person belongs to, what their words are, or who their allegiance is to.

""It's all the same to the Many-Faced God"".

Every story has a point, and with last night's episode, we've arrived at ours.

In the face of certain death, our heroes are spending their last moments with each other, with their chosen families, with the people they love, because when you're dead, power and lands and titles and wealth don't matter.

Soon they will be fighting for the living. Not for the Starks, or the Lannisters, or the Targaryens.

So, in these final moments, it becomes clear that, perhaps, all along, they should have been sitting around fires, singing and drinking, making love, sharing a meal, telling stories, and enjoying each others company.

It wasn't fan service and it certainly wasn't filler. It was the story arriving at its point.

The way he was right away so invested in preparing the expedition North, doing a duty he actually believes in, even if it meant fighting alongside ennemies.

984,"I believe Varys has been poisoning Dany. This could have led to, well, you know. 

Varys: Nothing?
Girl: She won’t eat. 
Varys: We’ll try again at supper. 
Girl: I think they’re watching me. 
Varys: Who
Girl: Her soldiers 
Varys: Of course they are. That’s their job. 
Varys: What have I told you, Martha?
Girl: The greater the risk, the greater the reward.
Varys: Go on, they’ll be missing you in the kitchen. 

Edit: I wanted to add I believe she has recently been poisoned as she has been losing it (s8). This would have sewn the seeds of doubt Varys had been talking to everyone about. I believe Varys was going for a fatal dose this episode to prevent destruction.

My evidence:

My post after last week believing Varys to be poisoning Dany. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/blcdsq/spoilers_varys/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app

Also:
He possibly did the same with the mad king. 
We know of a poison that would make a “mouse fight a lion”. 
“beware the perfumed seneschal”. 
Ned: I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.
Pycelle: Yes. Women, cravens and eunuchs. Did you know Varys is a Eunuch.

Edit edit: I do believe she always had some madness. I do believe she wanted revenge. I do believe she always wanted fire and blood. I do believe the poisoning was part of that too. They “can live together”. lol

I also believe the rings were either a throwback to Olenna or the “reward” for Martha, the girl.

I loved everything about this episode and it truly felt like a final farewell to most of these amazing characters whose stories we have been following for so many years.  

&amp;#x200B;

But the fact that so many GOT fans calling it a needless filler episode and some even calling it outright boring plus it getting just an average rating of 8.9 on IMDb (avg acc to GOT's own standards), is all a bit disappointing for me..

988,"I mean holy shit, Lena Headey has been absolutely killing it as Cersei, basically every scene across 7 seasons, but there was something about her delivery on this line that gave me chills. It was the only time I recall her truly revealing any vulnerability, and suddenly, for just a moment, she sounded like a child crying ""it isn't fair"". It only lasts that one line before she gathers herself and returns to Darth Cersei, but there was so much in that moment. 

The most compelling villains are ones whose villainy is grounded in real pain or loss, and now that her pure, true love for her children is gone (one of her two redeeming qualities, along with her cheekbones) she is probably the most dangerous individual on the map who isn't commanding an army of the dead.

992,"tl;dr it took about 5 days for word to get to Dany and for her to get back to them. Which is about how long it would take for the ice to freeze enough to support  the army of wights.

Regarding Gendry, The Raven, and the timing of it all, it makes sense. I'm going to assume since they were looking for a lone White that they were not going in a straight line from East watch, they were probably going back and forth in a zigzag (rip rickon) so Gendry running at full speed back to the wall, let's say that took about 4 hours. The trip from Castle black to Winterfell is about 600 miles (a little farther from East watch), a raven going full speed (28mph) could probably make that trip in a little over a day. From Winterfell to King's Landing is about A Thousand Miles according to Cersei in S5E6, so it would be about the same maybe a little more from Winterfell to Dragonstone. So let's say it takes the raven 4 days to get to Dragonstone. Dragons on the other hand, I couldn't find much info about how fast they can go. So for the sake of argument let's say they top out with a rider at about 175 mph. So that's about a 12-hour flight straight to Snow Team 6. So the overall time it takes Danny to get to Jon, is about 5 days. This makes sense considering that they had to wait for the ice to freeze over the lake again. Considering that the ice had to support a huge hoard of wights, the ice would have to be around 8 inches thick. Assuming an average temperature of 10 °F (they're not that far north) the ice would be growing at 1.5 inches per day. This works out to 7.5 inches of ice. Guys, the math works out.

994,"The Free Folk are a culture that respects strength and courage above all else, and have a strong oral tradition. After everything that's happened so far, Jon Snow will definitely be one of the most important characters in Free Folk lore for the children of the survivors. 

For one, he killed Qhorin Halfhand, one of the most feared Night's Watch rangers among the Free Folk. Even though he let Jon kill him, nobody knows that but Jon. He's killed some of the most dangerous fighters among the Free Folk as well including Styr. Speaking of Styr, Jon successfully led the defense of Castle Black from Tormund and Styr's war party, which was likely composed of some of the Free Folk's best warriors whom he also racked up a pretty solid kill count against.

At Hardhome, not only did he convince the leaders of the Free Folk to join forces with him and come south of the wall, but he stayed to fight and buy them time to get onto the ships when the wight army attacked. On top of that, he carried out one of his greatest feats in killing a fucking White Walker, a mythical creature that nobody had seen in thousands of years, let alone killed. The thing that killed another great Thenn warrior. And not only did Jon stand and fight it to buy his people time to get the Free Folk to the ships, but he killed the damn thing without even knowing he could do it. 

After all this, he was murdered by the Night's Watch, and then revived without being a wight. Tormund says that some of the men think he's some sort of god. Speaking of Tormund, he's one of the most respected leaders of the Free Folk, and he supports Jon which goes a long way towards earning him their support in general, both at Hardhome and in the buildup to the Second Battle of Winterfell. Then came the battle itself.

For one, after making the mistake of falling into Ramsay's trap with charging to save Rickon, Jon makes the stupid to us but brave to the Free Folk decision to charge the enemy on his own. Not long after, they follow him into the fray, and despite being walled in and pinned down, they fight ferociously for King Crow. Once the Knights of the Vale break the Bolton wall and free them, they watch as he follows Ramsay on foot along with Wun Wun and Tormund.

Then his biggest and craziest feat that they actually witness comes in his dealing with Ramsay Bolton. The Free Folk follow him into Winterfell, hastily dealing with the remaining Bolton forces before training their bows on Ramsay himself. Instead of giving the command for them to loose, Jon picks up the shield and calmly walks towards Ramsay, blocking each arrow as he goes. There's a brief moment when one of the wildling bowmen looks at Jon like ""is he really fucking doing this right now?"" Then Jon proceeds to beat the stuffing out of Ramsay before their very eyes. Think about how crazy that must have been to a wildling to watch: a man with nothing but a sword and later a shield walked up to a bowman, who would have the advantage at that distance, blocked every arrow, and just wrecked him with his fists. They must have been like ""is this really happening?""

Even if he isn't the greatest swordsman in the North, which he very well may be after everything that's happened, he has to be probably the most impressive martial figure to the Free Folk in their history. Even aside from the massive action of letting them south of the wall, there's no doubt he's made his mark on Free Folk history, and stories and songs of the great King Crow will likely be told and sung for hundreds of years after he's dead.",gameofthrones
995,"A lot of people complain that the shifts in a lot of characters' arcs felt too sudden in this episode.  They're not wrong.  Because they also did for the characters themselves, as the entire episode is about **who we all are, or what we reveal ourselves to be the moment fear takes control of us**.  It's sudden and dramatic by fear's very nature.  The episode's title, ""The Bells"", even calls to attention the *precise instant* this happens for most of our key characters.

We see it in the war scene itself.  It's not so much ""one good side versus one bad side"" as much as it is just one collective mass of people scared shitless fighting for their lives, and all it takes is one catalyst to bring that collective fear all the way to the forefront and, amidst pure chaos, for everyone to find out who they truly are.

Dany is that catalyst.  As we know, she is already afraid.  But once she hears the bells of surrender in King's Landing, that's the moment the fear fully takes hold of her.  The throne, the one thing she's always wanted is now finally hers for the taking.  The people of King's Landing do not love her, and she will not lose the product of her life's work the way she did everything else, so she does the only other thing she sees she can do: ""**Let it be fear**"".  She torches the city.

So, motivated by fear, **this is the very moment she puts the fear in everyone else**.  The walls break down completely.  All masks come off.  Everyone's true selves and desires rush to the forefront.

Grey Worm, feeling only wrath from the love taken from him, seizes this opportunity to massacre innocent surrendering forces.

Formerly surrendering forces fight for their lives.  They want only to survive.

Some of the victorious forces of the North do the same, while others seize the opportunity to wreak savagery upon innocents.  It's who they were all along, and we've taken their good will for granted.

We've all seen Jon Snow's face of realization: ""**This is wrong.  This was wrong all along.**""  From that point on, he can only make futile attempts to correct what can't be undone.

Knowing it's all over, Cersei's thoughts turn entirely to her unborn child.  It's not about ""who wins"" the throne anymore.  To her, the throne was merely her and her family's refuge, a refuge she held by committing countless evils in the name of protecting herself and those she loved.  Now, all she knows is that she cannot let her unborn baby die, not here.  She flees.  She weeps for her child.

And even among all of this, the sound of the bells was only the moment the fear hit *most* of our characters.  Others had fear take control of them slightly prior, but the bells served as the crossroads for those very fears nonetheless.

The moment fear took control of Jaime was one episode prior.  By every observable metric, he was a changed man that had every intention of atoning for his past.  But the moment Sansa told him that Cersei would be executed without him, that's when his fear took hold.  **He could not let the woman he'd loved his entire life, from the moment of their birth, die without him there**.  It was not a ""reversal"" or ""squandering"" of his character arc.  He had indeed become a better man.  But he was the only person to *ever* see that side of Cersei, and he was afraid to let it die.  Even at the moment of he and Cersei's death, he tells her ""it’s just us, that's all that matters"".  The fear made him realize that his memory of that love is all he would have been content with, and given familial love being the sole motivator for all of Cersei's sociopathy, it was literally his answer to her lifelong struggle.

Obviously, The Hound fears his brother.  He knows this crossroads at King's Landing is his chance.  He fears *NOT* getting revenge, and Arya thinks she shares this in common with him.  So as a litmus test, he makes it as clear as he can to Arya: if you follow me down this path, **you will die**.

And despite all her talk, *that* is the moment the fear hits Arya.  She doesn't want to die.  She runs through the streets trying to escape, and in doing so finds that she doesn't want *the people* to die as well.  Fear triggers her survival impulses, not just for herself, but for others as well.  She's afraid to die.  There's more she needs to do.  There's more everyone needs to do.

And lastly, or firstly rather, seeing the crisis of ""the bells"" coming days in advance in true character fashion, Varys remains the person he's always been.  He fears the wrong person being seated on the throne, one that leads by instilling this very fear in them at all, the fear that arises from fire and blood.

And that, my friends, is why this episode is brilliant.  It is *pure* Game of Thrones.  We're nothing but sacks of meat and blood, and some bone to keep it all standing.  When life-or-death fear hits, we become our basest, most elemental selves, and no one is invulnerable. 

**TL;DR: Characters' arcs shift fast because the whole episode is about fear and who we reveal ourselves to be once that fear is put in us.**

EDIT: Since this blew up more than I thought it would, let me add one more little thing: Thank you so much to everyone putting thought and passion into both their approval and disapproval of this episode, as discussion is all I wanted to spark here.  Additionally, I can’t help but notice that a good 80% of the comments disapproving of this post are either personal insults or just repeating “NO. WRITING BAD” and nothing else.
