0,Just read this in AGOT. I figured the oldest one the Targaryens lined the throne room with would be Balerion whose would’ve been around 400-500 years old if you count life and post mortem? I suppose there may have been skulls on Dragonstone older than Balerion that they had brought to KL. Also kind of disappointed that there was no mention in F&amp;amp;B or AWOIAF of which Targaryen king started this custom.,asoiaf
1,") for an instant it looked as though he might cut his way free. Then the Hound was on him. Sandor Clegane’s first cut took off Cayn’s sword hand at the wrist; his second drove him to his knees and opened him from shoulder to breastbone.

2,"IIRC either varys or littlefinger suggested to ned that Stannis was told about the incest by someone rather than him suddenly having suspicions, stannis then went to jon arryn which led to the events of the first book. Do you think he was told and if so by whom? 

I would suspect littlefinger as he definitely wanted war although he couldn’t have been certain that Stannis wouldn’t go straight to robert. It seems that all of the small council knew except robert and barristan, pycelle obviously knew as he let jon arryn die and im fairly certain renly knew otherwise his plan to wed margery to robert was completely nonsensical. Any other ideas?",asoiaf
3,"As we all know, in asoiaf it is commonly believed that Harrenhal had a great curse placed on it when Aegon roast Harren and his sons alive with Balerion the Black Dread. However, I think I have a far more earthly and reasonable explanation for the curse of Harrenhal. Specifically it's location, the castle is strategically located in an incredibly important area caught between 3 of the 7 kingdoms (Riverlands, Westerlands, &amp; The Vale of Arryn), and the Crownlands. Combined with that it functions as an incredibly important strategic obstacle for any Northern army trying to march southwards. Meaning that nearly every major or middling conflict that happens Harrenhal is almost certain to be wrapped up in due to it's strategic location. Similarly, for all Harrenhal's scale and ghostly grandeur, the territory that comes with it would be suitable to maintain only a minor fiefdom nothing needed to maintain such a strategic chokehold without significant outside help. Which forces the current owner to seek outside help from one of the various Kingdoms (largely depending on the conflict in question). 

This all leads to the natural conclusion that Harrenhal is ""cursed"" because it is exists in a strategically untenable situation that forces the owner to constantly make compromises. Where your household is the front line in the vast majority of minor disputes between great houses. Leading what would otherwise be a blip on the radar to the rest of the kingdom, to be a disaster waiting to happen for you.",asoiaf
4,"So we're all aware at this point of how Bronn and Jaime's stories diverge over the course of the show: after Dorne, Bronn rescues Jaime from Daenerys' forces at the Reach but is employed by Cersei to kill her brothers after Jaime leaves her.

I didn't necessarily dislike that plot in and of itself, but the way it played out was just corny and felt like misguided fan-service towards people who like Bronn. 

If we know anything about him it's that he's a cutthroat through and through. While he did share quite a few important moments with Tyrion, the fact that both he and Jaime had screwed him out of his plunder multiple times should have been enough for him to take up Cersei on his offer. What's worse is that he specifically tells the two of them that if anything about Daenerys' chances changes, he WILL in fact kill them.

And then Daenerys' chances do change. They murder Rhaegal in spectacular fashion, leaving her with only one dragon and a measly force of arms. Obviously we know how that mess turned out, but the point still stands. 

So my pitch is: instead of randomly having Euron be the one to fight Jaime on the beach, why not have it be Bronn? Set their battle right before Daenerys blows away the Golden Company, and you could use it as an opportunity to come full circle with the fact that Bronn is the one who taught Jaime how to fight again after losing his hand.

You could even have their respective deaths play out in the same way. Jaime could still die in Cersei's arms, I just feel like having Bronn actually attempt to fulfill his contract would make way more sense than Euron having such a weird personal vendetta against Jaime for no reason other than...them both having fucked the queen?

Or I dunno, maybe this is equally stupid. Either way, Bronn as Lord Paramount of the Reach? Lol what?",asoiaf
5,"Boiled Leather is definitely my favourite ASOIAF/GoT podcast -- Sean T. Collins has been a part of the podcast less and less over the past 12 months, but in their hay-day Sean &amp; Stefan were powering through quality episode after quality episode.

It was with great anticipation that I saw they released their ""season 8 review"" episode, with the duo back together again.

Personally, I am very much in the camp of ""season 8 killed me"" -- it was 80% utter disaster, that 20% being mostly made up of 2 relatively decent episodes to kick off the season. That said, the dialogue had gone, the realism had gone, outrageously self-defeating fan-service was here in force. These three things were pretty terrible to sit through.

I was shocked, then -- genuinely shocked -- [to hear Sean &amp; Stefan speak positively of season 8.
](https://ia601502.us.archive.org/18/items/stefan_sasse_gmx_BLAH_201906/BLAH.mp3)

And yet, while I did not end up agreeing with the two boys, it was oddly refreshing to hear two very informed watchers/readers of ASOIAF/GoT come out and speak positively of season 8. In particular, they made some very good points about how the fandom essentially created a chain reaction of hatred, suggesting the show wasn't quite as terrible as the hive-mind's extreme reaction suggested.

They talked about visual story-telling, arguing that while the dialogue dried up, actors did more lifting with body language, facial expression, etc. They specifically pointed to Dany here -- her turn to evil might not have been foreshadowed in the same way that foreshadowing worked in the early seasons, but in terms of visual story-telling it's hard to argue that there were no signs she might go cray-cray.

Personally, while I have some time for these points, they don't make up for the shoddy writing of season 8 (&amp;7&amp;6), the role of Euron, the mechanisms used to progress the story like Dany ""forgetting"" about the Iron Fleet (possibly the worst decision of the entire season was utterance of that sentence in that interview).

But still, as I say it was oddly refreshing to hear people who are bone fide experts on ASOIAF speak positively about season 8. Worth a listen!",asoiaf
6,"Re-Reading A Game of Thrones right now. I was gathering that Illyrio's final conversation with Viserys was Illyrio more or less bemusedly abandoning Viserys to his obvious fate. Also on the re-read it becomes clear (and almost funny) that Illyrio begs Varys to delay the Starks and Lannister's fighting and Varys immediately reveals Daenerys is pregnant in the next chapter knowing that Ned will never accept Robert's predictable response. My bigger question though, is what exactly were Varys and Illyrio hoping to gain with Viserys? Obviously they always intended to reveal fAegon as their ""one true heir"", and have Dany with her Dothraki horde as support, but what of Viserys? Had he lived, what would they have done to deal with this incredibly vain and jealous prince?",asoiaf
7,"Rereading the series I noticed something that hadn't popped out to me before. I did a quick search on here and hadn't seen anybody point it out before. I am almost certainly reading way too much into this.   


Robert Baratheon relates a story about getting into a food fight with a squire while he and Eddard were fostering at the Eyrie. The food they were fighting with, of course, was oranges. Oranges are a symbol of death, and of course Robert would die a few chapters later in the book.   


I'm sure there are lots of other times oranges are mentioned and the characters don't die, but it still stuck out to me. Anybody else notice?",asoiaf

9,"Ned made many mistakes in AGOT, but one I haven’t seen discussed much is his selection of Ser Beric Dondarrion to bring the Mountain to justice. Or to be more specific, his selection of Dondarrion over the enthusiastic volunteering of the young Knight of Flowers, Ser Loras Tyrell.   
   
&gt; “Lord Eddard!” The shout came from the west side of the hall as a handsome stripling of a boy strode forth boldly. Out of his armor, Ser Loras Tyrell looked even younger than his sixteen years. He wore pale blue silk, his belt a linked chain of golden roses, the sigil of his House. “I beg you the honor of acting in your place. Give this task to me, my lord, and I swear I shall not fail you.”   - AGOT, Eddard XI
   
After selecting Dondarrion instead, Ned explained to Ser Loras:   
   
&gt; “When the echo of his words had died away, the Knight of Flowers seemed perplexed. “Lord Eddard, what of me?”
Ned looked down on him. From on high, Loras Tyrell seemed almost as young as Robb. “No one doubts your valor, Ser Loras, but we are about justice here, and what you seek is vengeance.”  - AGOT, Eddard XI
   
As soon as he dismissed the court, Varys privately questioned the wisdom of this decision. But Ned remained firm:   
   
&gt; “You are a bolder man than I, my lord,” the eunuch said softly.
“How so, Lord Varys?” Ned asked brusquely. His leg was “was throbbing, and he was in no mood for word games.
“Had it been me up there, I should have sent Ser Loras. He so wanted to go … and a man who has the Lannisters for his enemies would do well to make the Tyrells his friends.”
“Ser Loras is young,” said Ned. “I daresay he will outgrow the disappointment.”   - AGOT, Eddard XI
   
Ned does not seem to understand the political ramifications of what Varys suggested. He merely saw Loras as an inexperienced and vainglorious “stripling” of a knight, as green and inexperienced as his son Robb, perhaps not understanding how accomplished the “boy” actually was. More importantly he failed to take the opportunity to potentially unite the Tyrells, one of the most powerful houses in the land, with his own cause.   
   
I think this is a huge butterfly effect moment in the series. Had Ned chosen otherwise, Ser Loras would have ridden out into the Riverlands with a host likely including a high measure of his father’s own bannermen, Reachmen, under the King’s banner to face the Mountain and Tywin Lannister’s cronies. If Loras succeeded then the Reach would be at war with the Lannister’s. If he lost and died the Tyrells would essentially be in the same position as the Starks after Ned’s death, ie unable to come to terms with the Lannister’s due to blood being spilled. Additionally had Ned sent Loras into the field then Loras would not have been able to flee Kings Landing with Renly and orchestrate his crowning and marriage to Maergery. So perhaps Ned lost the chance to have Renly on his side with this action too.   
   
There are many ironies here, and I want to point out one: Sansa’s reaction in her next chapter:   
   
&gt; “Her father’s decision still bewildered her. When the Knight of Flowers had spoken up, she’d been sure she was about to see one of Old Nan’s stories come to life. Ser Gregor was the monster and Ser Loras the true hero who would slay him. He even looked a true hero, so slim and beautiful, with golden roses around his slender waist and his rich brown hair tumbling down into his eyes. And then Father had refused him! It had upset her more than she could tell. She had said as much to Septa Mordane as they descended the stairs from the gallery, but the septa had only told her it was not her place to question her lord father’s decisions.” - AGOT, Sansa III.   
   
Sansa is vexated with her father for this decision, though perhaps for the wrong reason. Regardless she is absolutely right that her father made the wrong call, a point which Littlefinger confirms to her:   
   
&gt; “That was when Lord Baelish had said, “Oh, I don’t know, Septa. Some of her lord father’s decisions could do with a bit of questioning. The young lady is as wise as she is lovely.” - AGOT, Sansa III.  
   
As far as Ned’s mistakes go this might have been the biggest. Even his utterly naive daughter knew it. What a fool.",asoiaf

11,"In an early Arya POV in SoS, an old woman at High Heart describes her prophetic dreams that foreshadow later events.

12,"Edit: I of course mean Sansa, not Sandra. Stupid autocorrect.

This is almost certainly out there already, and I should probably use the search function better, but at the moment it seems to me that the consensus on the sub is that Sansa *probably won't* wind up as Queen in the North (it raises too many thorny political issues) but *probably will* end up Lady of Winterfell.

I tend to be a bit more circumspect, and have never been totally convinced that she'll make it to the end of the series.

Thinking about it in more detail, though, I'm beginning to suspect that not only will she die, but that she might die at the hands of her own mother.

I don't have a lot of deep book quotes and foreshadowing to back this up, but I do think it's been a long time since the shocking death of a sympathetic character, and I don't really see how Lady Stoneheart's story can end if not by killing one of her own children.

LSH's whole deal is vengeance, and the tragic vengeance quest has as fairly set arc: something you care about is harmed, your swear vengeance on those responsible, you wind up harming the very thing you cared about. Catelyn's entire deal is trying to protect her children. LSH's entire deal is avenging herself on the people she blames for the deaths of her children. *Surely* it has to end with her killing one of her children.

And of the five, which? Robb is dead already. Bran is slated for the throne. Rickon is *possible* but would feel like a bit of a cop out since he's barely in the book and isn't PoV.

That leaves Arya and Sansa. And I don't think it'll be Arya.

This isn't necessarily something I *want* to happen, I'm not a Sansa hater, it just feels a bit tragically inevitable.",asoiaf

14,"Jon's Winterfell crypt dreams have always fascinated me. I wrote another post on them earlier, talking about how the limp in his leg indicated that these dreams were sent to him via weirwood or through some other supernatural entity. I was thinking recently about all the theories about what's in the crypt for Jon to figure out or confirm his parentage or whatever, and they all leave me a bit dissatisfied. Seems a little... unlike Martin to have Ned do something like bury Rhaegar's harp down with Lyanna, or something of that nature. 

The crypts in Jon's dream, however... 

I believe that the thing that's in the crypts which will prove Jon's identity to himself is Dream Lyanna. I think come Winds or Dance we are going to get another dream chapter where Jon is freaking out down in the crypts, calling out the names for all his family members... and then finally, maybe, he'll call out for his mother. Because he's never called out for his mother in his crypt dream; why should he? And yet who do we know is buried in the crypt, established super early on in ASOIAF? Lyanna. 

Jon will have his own little intervention from his mother via dream just like Jaime had one with Joanna. Their dreams share other similarities as well. It might seem a little repetitive, but maybe there's some special mama magic happening which allows them to see their sons through dreams (probably not, but it'd be cute though).  

I can only speculate the events which would lead Jon to refocus on the identity of his mother, since in Dance he spares approximately one thought about her potential identity with that fishwife comment from Stannis. I think something will pull him back to think of her though, especially since he brooded over her for so much of the first three books in comparison. 

Shout out to u/DaoDeDickinson for prompting this thought back then, but my mind exploded and I'm personally convinced that this will happen. I've been stewing on it for a while and I think it's thematically consistent with Jaime and Jon parallels.",asoiaf

16,"I was a huge fantasy fan as a kid, read and re-read LoTR, Harry Potter, and an assortment of more kid oriented series. Recently I got hooked on the Game of Thrones TV show, and wanted to read the books as well and get back into the genre with Asoiaf. I've heard many say that George RR Martin is one of the best world builders along side Tolkien, and I was wondering, what would I read to go deeper and learn more about his world? 

I've already committed to reading the 5 mains series books, but would love to learn more about the lore if there is. I've heard of Fire and Blood, but nothing past that. If anyone has a definitive order to read GRRM's works in this world, outside the main series, please let me know!

17,"""He looked south, and saw the great blue-green rush of the Trident. He saw his father pleading with the king, his face etched with grief. He saw Sansa crying herself to sleep at night, and he saw Arya watching in silence and holding her secrets hard in her heart. There were shadows all around them. One shadow was dark as ash, with the terrible face of a hound. Another was armored like the sun, golden and beautiful. Over them both loomed a giant in armor made of stone, but when he opened his visor, there was nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood""

Was discussing the idetentity of these three shadows with a few friends and came up with a decent theory I haven't seen purposed before. 

""There were shadows all around them (referring to the Starks). One shadow was dark as ash, with the terrible face of a hound.

I think this one is correctly believed to be The Hound. Not only does it directly say the hound but his armor has been described as the color of ash later on and it could be a reference to his burned face - fire leads to ash 

""Another was armored like the sun, golden and beautiful.""

This one is popularly believed to be Jamie, which I think is a viable options. But I think that it could also represent Cersei. Jamie and Cersei are one in the same at times and both can be armored like the sun, golden, and beautiful. And why I believe it to be Cersei will make sense in a moment. 

""Over them both loomed a giant in armor made of stone, but when he opened his visor, there was nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood""

So this shadow is commonly believed to be the mountain after his resurrection by Qyburn, but it just wasn't clicking very well. Not only did this feel out of sync as The Mountains ressurection doesn't happen too much later, but the hound and Jamie/Cersei are two character that are shadows that haunt the Starks and have an impact on their lives. But than we realized that it says ""over them"" and i was trying to decide if that them mean that the third shadow was looming over the Starks or over the other two shadows 

So in short. 

Shadow 1 is the hound

Shadow 2 is Cersei 

These two are looking over the Starks 

Shadow 3 is the Mountain 

This shadow is looking over the other two shadows, which the mountain does torment the hound and literally looks over Cersei as her protector.",asoiaf
18,"I've been rewatching Breaking Bad, and I remembered GRRM giving the show heavy praise back when it aired. He particularly commented on how ""Walter White is a bigger monster than anyone in Westeros"" and said ""I need to do something about that."" Here is the blog post: https://grrm.livejournal.com/337511.html

We were assuming GRRM would make the already evil characters even more evil (Ramsay, Cersei, etc.), but now I think it's clear that he was actually talking about turning Dany into the monster she becomes.

Walter White in Breaking Bad seems to be what GRRM planned for Dany. The show is 6 seasons highlighting a man's transition from a quiet pushover to a drug kingpin. Keeping in line with GRRM's stance that we are all capable of good and evil, Walter White, a man who seemingly never hurt a fly in his 50+ years of life, gradually finds it within himself to lie, cheat, steal, and murder. He finds enormous satisfaction in the transition from weak to powerful. He is incredibly natural at it, too. He finds his calling, and it leads to his demise.

I believe the Breaking Bad writers nailed what George is trying to write for Dany, and they vastly out-performed D&amp;D. Breaking Bad had 6 seasons to show Walter's evolution, GoT tried doing it in 6 episodes. GRRM probably hyped Breaking Bad up as much as he did because he understands firsthand how hard it can be to successfully and satisfyingly write a person's descent into madness.

Anyway, this was just a little observation I made during my rewatch of Breaking Bad. Maybe D&amp;D should have consulted the writers of Breaking Bad before wrapping up GoT.",asoiaf

23,"Lesson 1 of story telling (even before ""show, don't tell"" and ""leave out the parts the reader's going to skip"") is that stories are inherently about conflict. *Someone wanted something, and then they got it* -- that's not a story at all. There has to be an obstacle there, something creating conflict for the characters.

What I'll discuss in this post is a special sort of though, but first a quick tip of the cup to [Lindybeige](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wES5ufXETdE&amp;fbclid=IwAR16WFHMXKt6Ph5xBlx0SMmi3waU61zVBITte2B20hZbm8lbTFj0O-iwgGA) who had a video about creating drama in role playing games which inspired this post. The specific conflict I have in mind is when a character has a deeply personal, emotional or psychological need, call this a sort of ""core-self need."" An element of that core-self is that they need to get something from someone else, and of course since we're talking about conflict, that other person isn't giving it to them. (There's internal conflicts as well, but this post is about the interpersonal ones.)

Typically in fantasy and scifi adventure series, the conflicts focus around big dramatic action. The guy needs to get the MacGuffin, but the evil thing is in the way and so he has to destroy it. Robb Stark wants independence for the North and vengeance for his father's murder, but there's a pesky Lannister army in the way that needs destroying. With some good pacing and quippy dialogue and a couple clever turns, this kind of conflict can be engaging, but on its own it ends up being a bit more history lesson than engaging story. Throwing in lots of details about the smallfolk and food and farming and the dangers of simply walking down the road makes the story more vibrant, but if that's all it's got then it's just a history book with the history of average folk added in.

What really gets an audience engaged is when there's an emotional goal as well. Miles Morales (Into the Spiderverse) wants his father to be proud of him, but his father's attitude about Spiderman gets in the way. To use Lindybeige's example, Walter White (Breaking Bad) wants respect from his wife Skyler, but instead a sense of pity (and later a lack of trust) gets in the way. Harold Crick (Stranger Than Fiction) wants his life to amount to more than just being a IRS functionary, and Karen Eiffle offers that to him, but at a terrible price.

In A Song of Ice and Fire, of course lots of the conflicts are the sort where a person wants a rather tangible thing, an enemy stands in the way, and the resolution to the conflict is a sword, or perhaps a very large number of swords, or maybe just a single dagger carefully placed. That's all well and good; if we wanted to read Pride and Prejudice, we'd read just Pride and Prejudice (and you should *also* read Pride and Prejudice, nothing wrong with it). But, the plot lines that really stand out in ASOIAF are often those where a character needs some emotional thing from someone else who is unable to give it to them. If that sounds like sappy romance stuff, consider just how complex and unique the emotional needs and barriers are in the series with these examples (obviously just a few of many):

**Brienne and Renly**

We learn about this mostly after Renly's death, but Brienne loved him and wanted his love in return -- not necessarily a romantic love (she'd be too insecure even if she got it), but a sort of loving respect and acceptance. Why can't Renly give her that? Because of a deep personality clash between the two. Brienne is serious, stern, and humorless, while Renly is joyous and carefree. Brienne offers rebukes for not calling Renly ""Your Grace."" Renly offers peaches. She wants to be taken seriously, and her flaw is that she takes herself too seriously. He will value her sword, but never her friendship. Later, she will find what she's looking for, but it comes from unlikely sources, Jaime and Podrick, and here the conflict is ironic. Instead of seeking psychological fulfillment from people she respects, she has to learn to respect the people who can offer her fulfillment.

**Ned and Robert**

At the surface level, this friendship seems to run roughshod over the rule of ""show, don't tell."" We're mostly told that Ned and Robert are great friends, but we're shown a deep conflict in personalities and intense arguments. What makes the relationship come to life on the page though is that they both need something from the other, and neither of them is getting it. What King Robert wants is to roll back time and reclaim the glory of his youth, and he's hoping bringing Ned to King's Landing will give him that. But, Ned can't do it. He's a family man now, and can't just pack up, move across the Narrow Sea and join the Sellsword King on some grand adventure. From Robert, Ned wants the rebellion and the vengeance for his sister, brother and father not to have been in vain; he wants Robert to honor their sacrifice by being a better king. But, Robert can't give him that. He was made to fight, not to rule, and beyond that, the crown makes moral demands of Robert that Ned cannot accept.

**The Hound and the Little Bird**

Sandor's hatred of his brother runs deep, but I think there's something he hates even more than Gregor, and it's the society that failed to protect him while elevating Gregor. Fearing death at his brother's hand, he fled into the service of the Lannisters who treat him like a dog. So why does he reveal to Sansa what happened to his face after the first day of the Hand's tourney, why try to shield her from Joffrey, why rescue her in the riots and try to help her escape King's Landing? What the hell is it that the Hound wants from the little bird that only repeats the pretty songs it was taught to sing?

I think what he wants is the romanticized version of the world Sansa imagines, where knights protect the weak and defend the innocent, and brutes who put their brother's face to the coals and murder their father are brought to justice. And of course Sansa can't give that to him. It's not in her power. The best she can do is say Ser Gregor is no true knight, but she can't give him justice. Then, during Stannis's assault on King's Landing, Sandor offers to help Sansa flee the city:

&gt;""Why did you come here?""

&gt;""You promised me a song, little bird. Have you forgotten?""

Sandor doesn't want to hear her sing, he wants her to make the song real, to let him be the valiant knight who rescues the beautiful princess from the evil king and his wicked mother. Sansa can't give him what he wants because she doesn't believe in it any more.

Of course when stories delve into these emotional conflicts, they often do so poorly. We've all seen the bumbling rom-com where He needs to be loved and accepted and She needs the same thing, but oh no, He saw Her with Cousin but thought it was another Him! Aside from just being hack cliches, that kind of conflict also suffers from the needs being too simplistic and the obstacles too trivial.

This is why while A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms stands out as a great moment from Game of Thrones, much of the final seasons feels lifeless (among many other reasons, of course).

**Sansa and Arya**

Reuinted back at Winterfell, Arya needs to know that Sansa is loyal to the family and especially to Jon. (Sansa doesn't have a strong emotional need from Arya; she mostly just wants to continue ruling without interference.) What's the obstacle to Sansa providing Arya with that reassurance? Well, there's hearing Joffrey say that Sansa begged for Ned's life but he's going to ignore her... And I guess there's the letter asking Robb to bend the knee which proves that when captured by the Lannisters Sansa was scared what'd happen if she fought back? Not a convincing obstacle. A single evening going back and forth about what they've been through would be enough to get the sisters on the same team, but to create (faux) drama the show had to resort to the ""what if they just don't talk for no good reason?"" cliche.

**Euron and Literally Any Queen Will Do**

Euron may be a clownish, cartoon character on the show, but at least we do know what he's after. He's a great adventurer, and wants his next adventure to be bedding the queen. First he wants the Dragon queen, but then just decides a Lion will do fine instead. He doesn't just want sex or a high station, he actually does have a fundamental (if shallow) psychological need, which is to Be The Fucking Man. Initially Cersei has a really good reason not to give him what he wants, and that reason is called Jaime. Fair enough. But then Jaime leaves Cersei, Euron returns with the Iron Fleet, makes his advances again and after a bit of ""let me say something Badass^TM that Twitter can quote"" Cersei gives him what he wants. Euron captured the Sandsnakes in a zero-effort surprise raid and then Jaime noped off while Euron was in Essos. He doesn't overcome any obstacle, it's just Euron wants a queen, then Euron gets a queen. That's not a story at all.

29,"For example, splitting them chronologically, having Feast be bigger in order to fit the climaxes into Dance, or even splitting them into three parallel books fully telling the stories in the South/East/North?

I think I'd have appreciated any of these approaches if it meant being able to fit whichever battles George had intended to, probably giving preference to a chronological split. That way we have a ""breather"" book in Feast dealing with aftermath, character development and buildup, followed by another action-packed installment in Dance where things start kicking into motion almost immediately and climax in some big battles.

The reason for this is that cutting off the end of Dance has led to people seeing both volumes as uneventful, and I strongly suspect created problems with writing Winds.",asoiaf
30,"I’m quite sure this has been mentioned before if I caught it, and I should have seen it before. But it occurs to me that in ADWD 38 The Prince of Winterfell Wyman Manderly, playing his role as the drunken fat oaf, served the Lords assembled for Ramsay’s wedding the flesh of his former Frey guests in meat pies.

The Freys were present during the mummer’s farce of a hearing Davos received but then went missing when they rode ahead of Wyman’s party’s ponderous pace to meet up with Roose’s host in the Barrowlands (IIRC). Roose and Ramsay suspect betrayal by Lord Too Fat but have no proof.

Then at the marriage feast at Winterfell Lady Dustin remarks to Theon about Wyman’s boasts regarding the meat pies he brought to serve the assembled guests. As Roose calls the Lords to the solar to discuss Stannis’ movements, Wyman (who I think is pretending to be drunk) calls to the singer “Abel” for a song about the Rat Cook. I’m sure we all remember the Rat Cook tale.

31,"I'm only about a quarter through the second book, but I'm interested in others thoughts on this anyway. I'd prefer if people don't give major spoilers please, even though I've read a lot of what happens before reading the books.. there are some things I've forgotten or don't know, one thing was spoiled for me on a sparkle quiz recently. My fault really. I've only put Spoilers Main in case simply which characters have POV chapters (all of which I know) might constitute spoilers.

So anyway, in the first book my favourite to read was Eddard. His chapters were soooo good.. sort of like an accidental detective or a PI kinda' feel which was cool. The ambiguity and the betrayal and ultimate tragedy, all that from Ned's perspective.. amazing!

I also really enjoy Jon and Tyrion's chapters. Jon is my favourite now in the second book. I love the Night's Watch anyway, the camaraderie n' all, kind of a Band of Brothers feel. Now that they've gone out looking for Benjen though, gets better. Only read one chapter since they've gone out thus far but I dig it much. Also Arya has become more one of my favourites to read in book 2, her travels with Yoren, Gendry, Hot Pie and Lommy are enjoyable.. a time in the show that I enjoyed very much as well.

As for my least favourite. Daenerys. Never liked her. In season 3 of the show is when it occurred to me that she was morally corrupt. In the books I think it's much clearer, from very early on, Mirri at the earliest for me.. maybe earlier for others. Mirri Maz Duur did a good thing. Daenerys' people raped and butchered and enslaved masses, Daenerys was with the king of those people, and was to have his son who would do the same.. and Daenerys brought dragons into the world, essentially weapons of war somewhat equivalent to napalm dropping aircraft. Dragons are the WMD's of GRRM's fantasy world. It is at times interesting and eye opening to read Daenerys, but as with the show I just don't find her all that interesting really. When it's a Daenerys chapter I'm just ""awww.. I want more of Westeros"". Might be that's it. Might be I'm so invested in what's happening in Westeros that I don't really want to go away to Essos.

Catelyn is becoming increasingly interesting to read, seeing Robb's war from her perspective is great.. and it almost has a tandem feeling to it where it kinda' feels like Robb's POV as well. Enjoyed the one Theon I read thus far. Cressen felt laborious to me, just the prologue though so not a big deal.",asoiaf
32," 

Firstly let me just say that I've watched the TV series and am halfway through ACOK, so am not exactly an expert on the topic, but I believe GRRM has no plans for including Howland Reed in his books. He is completely absent during various key events in which he should be present if he were an important character.

1. We hear nothing from him when Ned Stark is beheaded, yet he is supposed to be one of his greatest friends.
2. When the North rises in rebellion under Robb, not only do no crannogmen join the army (to the best of my knowledge), but he is also not at Winterfell when Robb call his banners. Furthermore, when Robb's army marches through the neck, which it must have, we hear nothing from Howland Reed.
3. Even though the north is being torn apart post-Red Wedding by the ironborn and the Boltons, he does nothing to defend the Starks. Arguably any resistance would have been futile, but it's just as if he does not exist.

33,"After the last season of GOT I have doubts about Daenerys fate and what is she gonna do when she arrives at Westeros and want to take KL. Personally I think that she won't burn KL like she does in the show. I believe that in the battle vs Fake Aegon something will happen (maybe she's losing the battle) that will make her decide to ride Drogon and spread fire and blood (I don't know if Rhaegal and Viserion will be alive) over KL at the possibility of losing what she has been fighting for all her life. Daenerys wouldn't do this to kill civilians, that would be the great consequence of his decision, because I believe that the battle will happen in part inside KL and I don't know why but I think Jon Connington will have left the civilians inside the city. I think Jon Connington won't want to commit the mistakes he made in the Battle of the Bells (coincidence with 8x05 title) and this time for him the civilians won't matter.

About the death of Daenerys I have no doubt that Jon will kill her as a sacrifice in the face of the war against the Others (like Azor Ahai and Nissa Nissa).

House Blackwood. This house is the furthest south that still worships the old gods. And they are the origins of the ever mysterious Bloodraven.

House Mallister. This family is criminally underrated for their importance to Westeros, imho.

**AFFC: Cersei, Dorne**

Cersei's utter incompetence as a ruler makes for great entertainment.  Dorne's chapters are mostly exposition.

**ADWD: Reek/Theon, Tyrion**

Jon's struggles as Lord Commander are a close second, but Theon's personal growth is the most compelling plotline for me.

More of a deep-seated subconsious preference that I think could have played a big part in her release of the Kingslayer. This isn't 100% proof or anything, so prepare yourselves for tinfoil.

**1)**

&gt;""She must be dead too"" - ACoK, Catelyn VII

She learns about the death of Bran and Rickon in this chapter and immediately gives up hope for Arya. This doesn't seem right considering that she spent a month waiting beside Bran's bed, believing so strongly that he would wake up.

It's also strange that she considers it feasible for Jaime (a man who is talking about how he'd like to rape her in the exact same conversation where she frees him from Riverrun) to somehow get Sansa back to her across the war-torn Riverlands, but not feasible for Arya to survive on her own? In the very same paragraph as the quote she talks about various traits and skills that make Arya probably the best Stark child in terms of fending for herself.

**2)**

When Tion Frey and Willem Lannister are killed my Lord Karstark and brought before Robb, she has a vision of Sansa being dead, but not Arya, even though there has been no indication that Arya is dead, and the Lannisters at least claimed they possessed her.

&gt;""*Will they lay Sansa down naked before the Iron Throne after they have killed her?"" -* ASoS, Catelyn III

No mention of Arya.

**3)**

Here is some real crackpot theorising: hair colour. We all know how important it is in this series. Now Robb, Rickon, Bran and Sansa have varying degrees of Auburn hair (Sansa is the reddest out of them all). Jon and Arya have Ned-like brown hair. Maybe Catelyn has a preference for those she believes to be more 'her children'?

I know this sounds ridiculous, but think about how much she hates Jon Snow. In the time between Ned's arrival from the South and Arya's birth, one of the main differentiating factors between Jon and her other children would have been his lack of inherited Auburn hair. Arya has this trait, the thing that symbolised the worst thing Ned ever did to her.

**4)**

It could be even deeper: characters have remarked on how similar Arya looks to Lyanna. Lyanna was pretty much the reason that Catelyn ever got involved in Robert's Rebellion, and why her betrothed (Brandon) was executed horribly. And if Catelyn suspected anything other than the official story about her being kidnapped, it would make Lyanna into a rather selfish and thoughtless person. Eloping with her lover while causing absolute turmoil and suffering, a bit like how Arya runs off and does whatever she wants without thinking about how it might affect other people.

**EDIT:**  **Some people havetaken this to be a 'Cat hate' post. That's inaccurate, I'm merely pointing out another possible layer to her character, and one that actually makes her more realistic, as well as giving another reason why the Jaime release happened.**

However, after the fight the kids decide that they are better of without consoles (Kings) and go off to do their own thing. 

It’s a bittersweet peaceful ending where people learn that fighting isn’t worth it and that peace will reign.

59,"Stannis' arc is often misunderstood in my opinion. It's pretty well believed that Stannis will burn Shireen in the books like in the show. Here is why that makes him such a tragic character.

He loved his daughter and never stopped loving her. It wasn't an easy thing for him to do, it was perhaps the hardest thing he's ever had to do. Stannis however though is the King in his mind, and as such he has a responsibility to protect the realm of men. He didn't kill his only daughter who he clearly loved to win honour or glory, he did it because in his mind it was his responsibility. He genuinely thought that killing his daughter was the only way to save the realm. That's why he did it. He didn't do it because he hated her, he sacrificed his only child in an attempt to save the realm. Hell why wouldn't he, every other time Mel had used blood magic it had worked. This is entirely in Stannis' character as well. He is a hard, unyeilding man who will do his duty. He sees being king as his duty, and as such he must rise to all sacrifice for the good of the realm without question. He killed his last brother with blood magic for the same reason.

It's also not the first time he's shown he cares more about being king, justice, and duty. He killed his own brother in blood magic because he saw him as a would be usurper and as such gave him the punishment required. He also kidnapped his own nephew with the intent of sacrificing him. It's clearly within his character to put his beliefs above his family.

If anything the burning of Shireen highlights his flaws in the perfect way. Here is a man who has been manipulated who genuinely believes what he is doing is the only way, and his responsibility to do. He must kill his own daughter in a horrific way, and if he does not then the realm will fail. Like a true King, he took the burden upon himself and made the sacrifice he had been lead to believe was the only option.",asoiaf
60,"In Fire and Blood as Good Queen Alysanne visits the wall, she tries to get her dragon Silverwing to fly beyond the Wall but the dragon refuses: 

“Thrice I flew Silverwing high above Castle Black, and thrice I tried to take her north beyond the Wall,” Alysanne wrote to Jaehaerys, “but every time she veered back south again and refused to go. Never before has she refused to take me where I wished to go. I laughed about it when I came down again, so the black brothers would not realize anything was amiss, but it troubled me then and it troubles me still.” 

Could that mean that just as the Wall keeps ice magic (the others) from crossing over to the south, it also keeps fire magic (dragons) from crossing over to the north?
This could play into the theory that the wall was erected as part of a treaty between the first men and the others. According to some theorists, that treaty strived to keep the realms of men and the realms of the others seperate. Maybe the white walkers simply want to enforce that treaty and men to leave their lands.

Just as Ned Stark wasn’t the hero of the books, nor Robb the young hero ready to avenge his father and save his sisters and the kingdom, so Jon is neither the savior nor rightful heir secreted into humble and abused beginnings. 

When I was watching the last season recently too, I just could not shake the fact that what we as the audience were witnessing in regards to Jon’s parentage was pure Benioffian Hollywood fan fiction, rather than a (poor, haphazard) adaptation of GRRM’s canonical outline. 

Jon Snow is the natural born son of Ned Stark, rather than the son of Lyanna. I find this the most realistic and interesting path. We already have an heir hidden in the rough in Gendry. 

I also think there’s a reason Ned is haunted by Lyanna’s promise, and it has nothing to do with hiding Jon as a secret Targaryen heir (which I personally find puzzling when Rhaegar and Aerys had a deliberate hand in his family’s demise.) I think he actually broke or was unable to keep Lyanna’s promise.",asoiaf

First, Catelyn had to ask for bread and salt rather than having it offered to them. This leads me to think that Walder was hoping that he could betray them without breaking the laws of hospitality. This is supported by the fact that Walder had servants and trays of food ready to be served as soon as Catelyn asked for it. Why would all that food be made ready if Walder did not plan on offering it?

Second, Walder gets annoyed when Robb wants to personally lead his men across the bridge to where his men are encamped. Perhaps he was hoping on splitting Robb's army from their commanders and thus securing the lords at the twins, and leaving their men without supervision (thus making them easier to kill).",asoiaf

So there was Jocelyn Baratheon married to Aemon Targaryen (son of Jaeherys I) and their daughter Rhaenys Targaryen was actually black haired (in the earlier works she was actually silver haired but was changed to black in WoI&amp;F and F&amp;B). But then she marries Corlys Velaryon and suddenly seed is not so strong and her children are silver haired. It makes sense with real world genetics and stuff, but wasn't the whole point of the Baratheon seed that it doesn't care about genetics. Even if Rhaenys was a Targaryen, she still was half Baratheon and black haired, so her children should be to. The main point why this matters is that her son Laenor was married to Rhaenyra and her three 'Strong' boys had dark hair and that's why they are considered to be bastards. Well their father wouldn't change if Leanor Velaryon had black hair considering his homosexuality, but bastardness of 'Strongs' wouldn't be so obvious and possibly one less reason for the Dance.",asoiaf

78,"Why was Garlan Tyrell given Brightwater Keep? I like him, but this seems a poor political decision on Mace’s part when Randyll Tarly and Leyton Hightower are married to Florents (and probably other Reach families are as well). Wouldn’t it have made more sense to give it to Randyll Tarly not only because he is married to a Florent but also as a reward for him doing the heavy lifting while letting Mace take credit for it? For Mace to take it for himself just seems greedy and grasping. 

I would also like to point out that by Andal custom and law, Brightwater Keep should pass to Melessa Florent and her children, and if not Melessa, then her sister Rhea and her children. Andal custom and law recognizes female inheritance in the absence of eligible male inheritors, in which case Alester and Alekyne are ineligible due to being deemed traitors. But Melessa, Randyll's wife, and Rhea, Leyton's wife, are not traitors, so there is no reason that the land should have been stolen from them and given to Garlan Tyrell. Even during the Dance of Dragons, in the case that a lord is deemed a traitor and stripped of his lands and titles and/or executed, their land and titles pass to their children, whether they be male or female (see House Rosby, for example).

So what Mace did is against custom and law. Illegal. Of course the Lannister regime, and Tyrell as their allies, has no respect for laws. 

People point out Leyton Hightower is Garlan's grandfather, but at the same time, his wife and likely youngest children are also Florents. I doubt he wants his grandson to become a lord at the expense of his wife and children being robbed of their rights. Same for Randyll, and indeed Leyton Hightower provides refuge to Florents from Tyrells. 

Sure, most of the Florents we meet are strange assholes, but they did nothing wrong in bending the knee to Stannis when everyone knows that Cersei’s children are bastards and that the Lannister’s regime is illegitimate. Stannis is the rightful heir because Robert had no trueborn children and so it passes to his eldest brother. Mace knows this.  

I am somewhat sure Tarly, Rowan, etc. are going to betray the Tyrells, and that if fAegon becomes king, the Tyrells might be stripped of their Lord Paramount position, which many Reach families have wanted for a long time. Sure, fAegon is probably a Blackfyre and I am sure many people would suspect him of being so, but the Blackfyres got most, or at least a significant amount, of their support from the Reach, hence the “friends in the Reach,” so I think even if he was a Blackfyre, they wouldn’t care because he would surely be better than Cersei’s dumb and cruel self. Also, I think a significant amount of the Golden Company are exiles from the Reach.",asoiaf
79,"With the introduction of Young Griff in Dance, it is pretty safe to assume that him and Dany are heading for an epic clash. A Dance of Dragons 2.0 and I believe that Young Griff will have one of Dany’s dragons. 

The Targaryen civil war split Westeros into rival factions, between Princess Rhaenyra supporters and her brother’s Prince Aegon. The Blacks and the Greens. 

And what color are Dany’s dragons? Viserion is cream. Drogon is black. Rhaegal is green. 

Someway, somehow Dany is going to lose Rhaegal to Young Griff. 

I know there is a lot of debate on whether Young Griff is a Targaryen or a Blackfyre, or just some random with Valyrian features. I believe that he is dragonseed, whether he’s the real deal or not we’ll never know. But he will become Rhaegal’s rider. 

If Young Griff is actually Rhaegar’s son it’s rather fitting that he will ride the dragon named after his father.  

If history will indeed repeat itself we’d have another civil war split between the Blacks and the Greens. 

Either way, I don’t think the fight between Dany and Young Griff is gonna be a curbstomp in her favor. 

Young Griff getting Rhaegal would be catastrophic for Dany’s psyche, even more so if she ends up having to fight and kill her own child. 

I think it would be a perfect setup/contribution for her madness descent.

84,"What do you think will be the name of Walder Frey's next baby? Yes, as you may already know, as of A Feast for Crows, Lord Walder's eighth wife, Joyeuse Erenford, is ""presently with child"". This new baby will be Walder's 30th trueborn child, and I'm willing to bet they will have an interesting name. After all, the Freys have always liked to name children after people in more powerful families, like:  
  
-Targaryen names: Most already remember of Stevron's son Aegon ""Jinglebell"" (born 249 AC, during Aegon V's reign), but Lord Walder also had a son called Aenys Frey. Aenys also happened to have two sons named after Targaryens, Aegon and Rhaegar (the latter of which was born during the reign of Aerys II, father of Prince Rhaegar).  
  
-Lannister names: Though we don't know when exactly they were born, Tytos and Tyta Frey were born either during of shortly after Tytos Lannister's lordship of Casterly Rock. Years later, as the power balance changes, Cleos Frey (son of Genna Lannister) names his son Tywin at 287 AC. Even later, Raymund Frey seems to be an even bigger fan of the lions, as he has a daughter named Cersei and twin boys named Jaime and Tywin. As a bonus, Lame Lothar's daughter Tysane may or may not have a typical Lannister name.  
  
-Roberts: That same Raymund Frey also had a son called Robert, at *the same year* Robert Baratheon became king. That guy is quick to pander. Later we have another Robert Frey, son of Rhaegar (oh, the irony), and a Robert Brax, son of Morya Frey.  
  
So, with that in mind, who do you guys think will be Joyeuse Erenford's first baby? Who will be the next powerful person the Freys will want to pander to? A Petyr? Yet another Aegon? A Daenerys, perhaps? A Stannis, if the Mannis gets south of the Neck? (he won't) All guesses and speculations are welcome.",asoiaf

&gt;And when Lord Umber, who was called the Greatjon by his men and stood as tall as Hodor and twice as wide, threatened to take his forces home if he was placed behind the Hornwoods or the Cerwyns in the order of march, Robb told him he was welcome to do so. ""And when we are done with the Lannisters,"" he promised, scratching Grey Wind behind the ear, ""we will march back north, root you out of your keep, and hang you for an oathbreaker."" Cursing, the Greatjon flung a flagon of ale into the fire and bellowed that Robb was so green he must piss grass. When Hallis Mollen moved to restrain him, he knocked him to the floor, kicked over a table, and **unsheathed the biggest, ugliest greatsword that Bran had ever seen.** All along the benches, his sons and brothers and sworn swords leapt to their feet, grabbing for their steel.

&gt;Yet Robb only said a quiet word, and in a snarl and the blink of an eye Lord Umber was on his back, his sword spinning on the floor three feet away and his hand dripping blood where Grey Wind had bitten off two fingers. **""My lord father taught me that it was death to bare steel against your liege lord,""** Robb said, ""but doubtless you only meant to cut my meat."" Bran's bowels went to water as the Greatjon struggled to rise, sucking at the red stumps of fingers … but then, astonishingly, the huge man laughed. ""Your meat,"" he roared, ""is bloody tough."" -- AGOT Bran VI

So here we have this great scene where Robb is challenged by Greatjon Umber, and quickly meets that challenge. It's widely understood that Robb's handling of this situation did wonders to cement faith and loyalty from most of the Northern Lords. All in all, it's an awesome moment.

My question is: What was Greatjon's plan here? If Robb's line is true, he (and those sworn swords who went for their steel as well) were all committing a crime punishable by death just by grabbing their swords - and this all against a rash boy Lord whose personality they don't really now. And what does grabbing his sword do for him anyway? It's not like he was going to physically attack and kill Robb, because that makes no sense and would put the Umbers into civil war with the rest of the north.Threatening him with physical violence also seems nonsensical, as everyone there would know that it couldn't be backed up for the aforementioned reason. Was he just going to kill Hallis Mollen, and then sheathe his sword and ask for a place of honor again? Or, was he going to ask for a duel as a result of that slight? I didn't think duels were much of a thing up North, although Brandon asked one of Rhaegar, so perhaps they have some place in the North anyways. Still, though, you win a duel against a 15 year old, how much does that do for your honor anyway?

TL;DR: Greatjon Umber's ""tough meat"" scene was a really dumb move on his part, and it feels like Robb's handling of the situation was the only way for everyone to get out of their with their honor intact",asoiaf
94,"The title says it all, I finished Feast a few days ago and, after reading lots of articles and Reddit comments about how it was the weakest of the series, it really surprised me with how good it was.

I think the Cersei and Jaime chapters were easily the best, getting to see into their thoughts and adventures. Cersei's descent into madness was very well done and Jaime has quickly become one of my favorite characters. Though few and far between, the Arya and Sansa chapters really delivered. Arya joining the Faceless Men and Sansa (along with Littlefinger) starting their political schemes were both high points as well. The ironborn plotline was awesome, the Kingsmoot was one of my favorite moments of the books so far and I this non-show Euron is so much more menacing and interesting. 

The Brienne chapters had many highs but they also seemed to drag on a lot. I loved the look into the state of the Riverlands and how her story reconnected with much of the characters and plots from the past three books but the chapters could have been condensed or shortened in my opinion. 

The only storyline I had a real issue with was Dorne. It seemed very slow building and uninteresting with characters that weren't super well developed. Doran refusing to do anything the whole time particularly bugged me but his speech at the end of the final Arianne chapter makes me more hopeful for Dorne to go somewhere in ADWD.

Overall, I think the slower paced and more developed story and world in Feast did the book wonders after the nonstop action of ASOS. I loved getting a glimpse into Cersei's mind, the common folk of the Riverlands, and exactly where the show went off the rails in terms of characters and plots. Super excited for ADWD now!",asoiaf

96,Is this an actual thing that happened in the middle ages? Or is this just one of those things George RR Martin likes to use?,asoiaf
97,"George RR Martin has said in the past that he is a ""gardener"" in that he does not come in with a big concrete plan for his books and series. Instead he comes up with an idea and runs with it, which develops into something that he may not have originally expected or anticipated. That does not mean that Martin does not have some set plans, as he knew the Red Wedding was happening in ASoS and made that the last chapter he wrote in the book. But there are other things that he admitted he never planned, the best example being Bronn, [a character who evolved from Martin needing someone to save Tyrion in a trial by combat and Bronn was the funny sellsword so he ended up being the one who saved Tyrion.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS75oRUx-4M)

The biggest, and in my opinion best, example of a character and story developing into something much more for Martin is Maester Aemon. I think from early on, Martin was planning to reveal that the old blind Maester of Castle Black was the ""last"" and forgotten survivor of the Targaryens. But by Martin's gardening-style, I think that as Martin was writing chapters for what was originally AGOT that became ACOK he grew more captivated by a story of this one Targaryen by adding that Aemon turned down the throne when offered, which led to the fourth son of a fourth son, Aegon the Unlikely, becoming King. Martin suddenly realized that he wanted to tell this incredibly story of the most unlikely of Kings and to add a magnificent twist, decided to make this King be the squire of the lowliest of knights and live a peasants life before becoming King.

We do know from publication dates that Martin worked on the Hedge Knight at the same time as ACoK. So probably a few lines of backstory in ACoK prompted the Tales of Dunk and Egg. 

Later on, thanks to History of Westeros research, we know that Martin came up with the idea of the Golden Company and the Blackfyres during writing the Sworn Sword, which came to factor into Young Griff and ADWD. Furthermore, and later as Martin wrote and re-wrote the super-book ADwD that became two books, he suddenly came to the idea of the fate of Dunk and Egg and started torturing/teasing readers with the cryptic stories of the Tragedy of Summerhall, which depending on your theory for what happened, may suggest that Martin came to decide that his prequel series would end up secretly set-up everything that happens in ASOIAF.

**TL;DR: I think that Martin writing Aemon's backstory interested him enough to write the spinoff stories of the life of Aegon the Unlikely, and he created Dunk and Egg.**",asoiaf

From the first time I put before my eyes the map of Westeros, I notice a similarity to the human body. Starting with the head (the north) and its similarity to the head of a witch.

Below the digestive system in its entirety (The Reach) and if you use your imagination accurately you can see well below to your left the sausage and chickpeas (Antigua?).

99,"Asha's in a pretty interesting position right now in the books. She's a prisoner of Stannis, she's just been re-united with Theon, and she's going to get caught up in the Battle of Ice.

And one of the theories I saw from time to time about where her story could go from here is that she would in fact be sacrificed. Clayton Suggs and a fair few of the Queen's men want to see her burn, and the theory is that, at some point in the winter, Stannis will allow her to be sacrificed to R'hllor. I've never been a fan of this theory, it doesn't feel right to me as a narrative beat. 

But I think the show has made this sequence of events a lot less likely. Asha's show counterpart, Yara, survives the series. Even though after she gets captured by Euron she basically disappears from the story. I think, if Asha died in the books, Yara wouldn't still be alive. They'd have had Euron take her out, to give Theon something to feel bad about and cut a loose narrative thread.

But they didn't. They chose to keep the character alive. Maybe they even had plans for the character, I know the actress was pregnant and they might have trimmed the character's screentime for her benefit, and that's why she has like, three lines of dialogue in Season Eight.

101,"There are reasons to believe that Season 8, Episode 6 is *not the ending*. See [https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/c5wb21/spoilers\_extended\_many\_questions\_one\_answer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/c5wb21/spoilers_extended_many_questions_one_answer/) for instance. Or watch Alt-Shift-X. He is quite subtle unlike this poster. He is not stating something so bold as “there is more”. He makes observations. Then you think about them, like why it is even mentioned that Drogon takes Daenerys – where? It doesn’t even have to be reasons – you might just have a *feeling* that there is something after Episode 6. Let’s take this assumption as a premise and discuss what shape that extra footage might take and when it might be released. 

## Is it an extra episode, an entire season (Season 9), or a movie?

My guess: It’s unlikely to be an entire season. After careful consideration, I can see how the remaining storyline can be resolved in 1.5-2 hours. 

An episode? When I finished watching Episode 6, my eyes were blinking the sign “What was that?”. Then my brain essentially without my guidance formed a simple beautiful explanation for what happened in Season 8. I predicted an episode. The prediction failed spectacularly but no less painfully for me. I expected it on May 26th. It didn’t come. Then I thought: it must be on the Memorial Day: 

People will have their *memories back* on the Memorial Day – beautiful theory, isn’t it?

Never materialized. Sundays after that? They came and gone. 

## A Christmas special? 

The format of that, whatever ‘that’ might be, is still mysterious, but we may try our luck with timing. I suspect it could be a Christmas special on HBO. Later, when I argue that it is done in a movie format, I don’t necessarily mean it is released in movie theaters. It could be an HBO-only movie. What is a movie, anyway? Releasing Christmas specials, which are often quite different in tone, worked for Dr Who. Why can’t it work for Game of Thrones? 

## New Year Day?

Not being very social myself, I wouldn’t know it firsthand, but I heard people were watching Game of Thrones with friends. In UK they were doing that to avoid accidental spoilers as the show was broadcast later than it was shown in the US. Again, secondhand knowledge. People get together with friends on a New Year Day. You probably wouldn’t watch Game of Thrones on your big family Christmas gathering. But you might be excited when that gathering is over to learn that something special is planned for January 1 on HBO. 

## 2020 before Bloodmoon? 

Not impossible, but an unpleasant thought as it means long wait. Can HBO handle fans’ frustration for almost a year? I canceled my subscription 20 minutes after Season 8, Episode 6. Then for two weeks I have been dreaming of happily resuming it the moment HBO announces: There is more! The moment never came, and I am still dreaming unsubbed. 

Releasing it in 2020 will give George a chance to publish The Winds of Winter. (Yeah, I know.) Before true extent of Bran’s tragedy and the cave travesty is revealed. 

Just to clarify: the prevalent mood seems to be that Season 8 is far from perfect, D&amp;D are useless without GRRM, and the show was rushed. And made no sense. I choose to believe that the show is quite brilliant – as soon as they show the final ending and everything would suddenly, almost improbably, make sense. 

## Why movie?

HBO publicly discussed a possibility of a film three years ago or so. Then the conversation strangely died down. It coincided with choosing direction for Seasons 7 and 8. I would argue that the decision to make a movie was done at the same time Seasons 7 and 8 were *ordered* to look like as written by idiots. Seem less than perfect, to put it mildly. The key word being ‘seem’, though. 

## Released in theaters? 

Releasing a movie will make HBO more money than an extra month of subscription. At the cost of taking just a little bit of extra footage, HBO stood to make millions. Season 8 was to be produced anyway. (I understand how some might feel that ‘produced’ is a *bit generous* for what we have witnessed in Season 8.) Why not invest 20% more in its production, to have both: a *show* and a *movie*? 

To clarify: I am not suggesting that HBO *will* make a movie or *will* shoot an extra footage. That would be impossible. I suspect that all the footage they need for a movie, they *already have*. Actors were asked to do an additional dialogue or a scene. Later they were told that it didn’t make the cut. Well, they were not on *the show* – they went into *the movie* instead. Some actors might not have a clue. I suspect Maisie Williams does, though, she is good with convincingly lying. That April Fool piece with – forgot, Jimmy Fallon? It was convincing. Like her line: 

&gt;I am going west of Westeros.

If HBO is ever going to release a movie on Game of Thrones, this year seems like the best time. The name has enough publicity and due to Season 8 it gained some controversy. The two you need to generate buzz. 

Aren’t D&amp;D going to make movies soon? It would make perfect sense to challenge themselves in a big screen format on the material that made them famous: Game of Thrones. HBO begged them to make more GoT – this is known. A movie was considered – that is also known. Logical resolution? D&amp;D might have said: Sure, but instead of seven episodes let’s make six and a movie. 

## Can a standalone GoT movie even work?

I would argue that ultimately no, it can’t. That’s why I favor HBO-subscribers-only movie theory. But an argument or two why it *might* work. 

Is it even possible to resolve all the nonsense of Season 8? And make it in a movie format accessible to general audience? Not knowing Theon from Tyrion and Bran the Builder from Bran the Broken? That can be resolved by having a *narrator* informing the audience of the crucial bits. Sam, I suspect. More on that next week, I hope. 

## The Title?

How do you think the movie would be called? Game of Thrones: The Endgame? Would Marvel/Disney approve? Given that Disney hired D&amp;D, I can see how they would. Much has been said on this hiring and how could it be justified after, apparently disastrous, Season 8. 

*Hey, Disney, you need specialists on how to ruin franchises and alienate fans? You think you have enough in Ryan Johnson? You have seen nothing yet. Wait till we release Season 8.* 

Seriously, though, the following is what Disney’s motives could be. If you *can* make a *great* movie, make a great movie. But it is getting increasingly hard nowadays. So, what if you can only make a *good* movie, but you need it to *feel* like a *great* one? Simple: make a mediocre one first. Whatever happens in Episode 9 of Star Wars, people would feel much better towards it simply because it is not Episode 8. Episode 8 had to be *bad*, but not too bad. Redeemingly bad if there is such a word. Meaning: many of what hardcore fans didn’t like about it should be fixable in Episode 9. 

This is how I imagine D&amp;D’s pitch to Disney: we are going to do something special with Season 8. We are going to make an exciting and outstanding product. With a *twist*. But release it *without* the twist. Yes, it will make the entire season look like we had no idea what we were doing. Fans will hate us for it. We’ll take it. And then – the redemption. The Endgame is released in 2019/2020/…2091 and everybody says: Wow. How is it relevant for Star Wars? Because you could find yourself in a situation when a movie or two turn out to be bad. Intentionally or not. But with us on board, your fans will believe that the faults of a movie can be fixed in a *next* one. So it would *only look like* things don’t make any sense, but in fact they make *perfect* sense. If indeed their pitch sounded a bit like it, I’ll let you figure out why Disney felt this kind of expertise is needed.

Here are the Seven questions to discuss if the Seven Kingdoms are to be redeemed:

1. Do you feel like there is more to the story after Episode 6? Without details on why – just a brief reason or a feeling. Nonsense, Episode 6 is the one and only ending that makes sense! 
2. Will the show ever do that extra or they left it to George to reveal the *true ending*? Isn’t the latter a bit… optimistic, if noble? 
3. Does HBO already have extra footage? If yes, how is it going to be released? As a season? An episode? A movie?
4. When is it going to be released? When is it going to be announced? 
5. Will you forgive HBO? If our speculations are remotely justified and there is *more* to the story, will you ever reconcile with HBO’s pretending that Episode 6 is the end? Basically, will HBO get away with playing with our hearts and pretending not just for a day, a week, a month, but for what now looks like a long time? 
6. Will you forgive *intentional* ruining of Seasons 7 and 8 if in the end we learn that it was on purpose to create a feeling of absurd and explain in the True Ending? It didn’t make sense, but now, do you see how it makes perfect sense – that sort of thing? Will this explanation fly? 
7. Some question of your choice?

103,"I'm currently reading the series for the second time. This time though, I noticed that after the attack on the Brothers at the Fist of the First Men, they talk about how the force that Commander Mormont took with him consisted of the bulk of the Night's Watch's forces that are capable of fighting. Most of them die, with only a few making it back after the attack and the betrayal at Craster's.

After Jon gets back to the Wall, he asks Donal Noye how many men remain, and he says ""something like 40-odd men."" Yet somehow they survive the attack from behind as well as from the front. At the end of the fighting, they say something like a hundred or more Brothers and common folk from Moles Town die during the fighting.

Since then, there are occasional comments about there still being something like hundreds of Brothers still active in the Watch. There are still man manning East Watch. In particular, in the beginning of Feast, Jon tells Sam that there are hundreds of man that can wield a bow, but only a handful who can read and write.

Am I missing something? Where are all these men coming from? How did the Watch regain so much manpower after the attack on the Fist? As far as we know, the stream of men coming from KL and the rest of Westeros has all but stopped during the war.",asoiaf

108,"Let me explain.

Show Euron bears almost no resemblance to the character whatsoever. He's a violent, somewhat insane pirate king of the Iron Islands... and that's it. Everything else is different.

Which means nothing about book Euron was really spoiled.

We learned absolutely nothing about what book Euron really wants, unless anyone is buying for a second that book Euron's entire ambition is to fuck a queen.

We learned absolutely nothing about his future allies because the nature of his alliance with Cersei (where cunning Cersei effortlessly manipulates loyal dog Euron) was so counter to book characterization that there's no compelling reason to believe it happens at all.

We learned absolutely nothing about what's going to happen when he faces the Redwyne fleet, or whether he's going to sack Oldtown, or whether he rides a dragon or brings down the Wall.

We learned absolutely nothing about Dragonbinder, or the Valyrian steel armor, or what shade-of-the-evening really does, or whether he was in Qarth pretending to be Urrathon Nightwalker, or whether Silence is a weirwood ship, or whether he has the greensight, or whether he skinchanges into his mutes, or any of the intense arcane mysteries surrounding the book character.

Hell, we didn't even learn for sure that Euron=Daario is false yet (it is though) because the show obviously had no idea what to do with Daario either.

While all our discussions about Bran and Daenerys and Jon are now dictated by trying to justify what happened to their show counterparts, literally no one I've seen has been dumb enough to say ""actually, Euron isn't going to do _______, the show says he's going to 360 no scope Rhaegal with a scorpion, inexplicably swim 5 miles to the exact same beach as Jaime, and then die in a swordfight with him, you're just in denial.""

So, thank you D&amp;D. I might have been momentarily hyped seeing Euron summon one CGI kraken under Yara's fleet (because WTF is a Redwyne?) but it wouldn't have been worth having all the theorycrafting and the maybe possibly eventually TBA release of TWOW spoiled.

2 Why didnt Benjen told the things he saw beyond the wall to Ned? He says to Tyrion ""dont tell me whats out there"", which means he might at least fought some wights, right? Why not tell Ned?


3 Euron rapes &amp; tortures his brothers , nephews etc. He is a monster. And he mocks Aeron when he tells him ""you cant kill me you'll be a kinslayer"" , and says ""i already am"" etc. But he gives away a fricking dragon egg so that he wouldnt kill a brother with his own hands?


4 Why does Mance hates the NW? He says this in Dance: ""I’ll even fight for you. Just don’t ask me to wear your cloak""


5 I am wondering how literal the word ""spat"" is on some context. ""spat back"" is usually doesnt mean spitting probably. But is spat in ""Turned his head and spat"" used literally? Do a character really turns his head and spits?


6 IIRC Haldon says JonCon conquered Storm's End to Arienne, but Preston says Arienne will help them take it. I didnt understand whats going on.


7 Did Jon offer Weeper a peace? If so, why doesnt Weeper accept it? And whats his answer? If its no, why not send Tormund and Val to him to convince him, why doesnt Jon at least consider about it?


Questions 8 9 10 are just about predictions.


8 What do you guys think will happen to Young Griff/Aegon until the long night? If he takes Cercei's place, he wont fight against the Others, which doesnt make sense. Who do you think will hold KL when Dany fights against the Others, or you think it will be completely different from the show?


9 What do you guys think will happen to Sam/Alleras/Jaqen at Citadel if Euron sacks it ?

116,"&gt;A Feast for Crows - Jaime VII  
&gt;  
&gt;That night he dreamt that he was back in the Great Sept of Baelor, still standing vigil over his father’s corpse. The sept was still and dark, until a woman emerged from the shadows and walked slowly to the bier. “Sister?” he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;But it was not Cersei. She was all in grey, a silent sister. A hood and veil concealed her features, but he could see the candles burning in the green pools of her eyes. “Sister,” he said, “what would you have of me?” His last word echoed up and down the sept, *mememememememememememe*.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I am not your sister, Jaime.” She raised a pale soft hand and pushed her hood back. “Have you forgotten me?”  
&gt;  
&gt;*Can I forget someone I never knew?* The words caught in his throat. He did know her, but it had been so long . . .  
&gt;  
&gt;“Will you forget **your own lord father** too? I wonder if you ever knew him, truly.” Her eyes were green, her hair spun gold. He could not tell how old she was. *Fifteen*, he thought, *or fifty*. She climbed the steps to stand above the bier. “He could never abide being laughed at. That was the thing he hated most.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Who are you?” He had to hear her say it.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The question is, who are you?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“This is a dream.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Is it?” She smiled sadly. “Count your hands, child.”  
&gt;  
&gt;*One*. One hand, clasped tight around the sword hilt. Only one. “In my dreams I always have two hands.” He raised his right arm and stared uncomprehending at the ugliness of his stump.  
&gt;  
&gt;**“We all dream of things we cannot have. Tywin dreamed that his son would be a great knight, that his daughter would be a queen. He dreamed they would be so strong and brave and beautiful that no one would ever laugh at them.”**  
&gt;  
&gt;**“I am a knight,” he told her, “and Cersei is a queen.”**  
&gt;  
&gt;**A tear rolled down her cheek.** The woman raised her hood again and turned her back on him. Jaime called after her, but already she was moving away, her skirt whispering lullabies as it brushed across the floor. *Don’t leave me*, he wanted to call, but of course she’d left them long ago.  
&gt;  
&gt;He woke in darkness, shivering. The room had grown cold as ice. Jaime flung aside the covers with the stump of his sword hand. The fire in the hearth had died, he saw, and the window had blown open.

Jaime had this dream at Riverrun, in his last chapter of AFfC. In the dream, he was back at the Great Sept of Baelor, standing vigil over the body of his father, which happened in his first chapter from the same book. A woman approached and Jaime mistook her for a silent sister. The woman was obviously Joanna Lannister but Jaime did not recognize her. Not long after he woke up, Cersei’s letter of plea came and Jaime ignored it as the last thing he did in AFfC. 

This comes as a sudden and surprising decision by Jaime, which is preceded by a cryptic dream sequence. We know this pattern from before. On a weirwood stump, Jaime had a strange dream with Brienne and when he woke up, he coerced his escort to go back to Harrenhal and save Brienne. We observed the growth of his interest in Brienne throughout ASoS just like we observed the growth of his estrangement with Cersei throughout AFfC. The pressure was building up but there needed to be a catalyst to make it go, which happened to be the cryptic dream sequences. As for the dream itself with Joanna, there is not much to discuss. We know that Tywin hated being laughed at. We know that he had higher hopes for his golden twins. Can this simple explanation justify the inclusion of such a dream sequence? Should we expect more meat from it?

Now let us get to the really interesting tidbits about this dream sequence, starting with the fact that it was not written as a dream at the beginning. As I discussed in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9s3f5j/spoilers_extended_early_affc_chapter_reading_from/), there is a report from the reading of Jaime’s first chapter in AFfC dating to January 2002. According to that report, this dream sequence with Joanna takes place in that first chapter of Jaime from AFfC where he stood vigil at the Great Sept of Baelor; whereas in the published version, it happens at Riverrun while Jaime *dreamt* of standing vigil at the sept. For some reason, GRRM moved this sequence from the first Jaime chapter to the last in AFfC and in the process, it turned into a dream.

Another thing to consider is that some of the Cersei/Jaime stuff taking place after ASoS was meant to be given as flashbacks and recollections from the 5 year gap. While GRRM was trying to make the gap work, he wrote the bare bones of the Cersei/Jaime centered storylines. He did not like so many things happening in flashbacks for some characters or nothing happening for others during the gap. Finally, he decided to remove the gap and created an extra book. At its conception, this new book was named as AFfC which was meant to cover all the POVs and 5 years of story time to make up for the gap. The book kept growing but the time kept slowing down. At one point, the manuscript passed 1600 MS pages, which was the threshold for binding a single book. Some characters had their arcs complete but many others had incomplete arcs and some of them (like Bran) had not even started yet. GRRM made the famous split and AFfC was published as it is today. It was meant to cover 5 years of story time at the beginning but the time span in the book ended up being around 6 months.

I recapped above detail to emphasize another important point. Just like the early version of this Jaime chapter as mentioned above, we have similar early readings of the first 2 Cersei chapters from AFfC. From those reports, we know for a fact that Maggy’s prophecy did not exist in those chapters, nor was there any mention of the old Gardener coins found by Qyburn. This means GRRM introduced Maggy’s prophecy and the Gardener coins subplot after he read these chapters in 2002. These details show that as the flashbacks and recollections conceived for the 5 year gap were fed into AFfC, there was a lot of expansion going on (which is kind of expected). Removing the dream sequence with Joanna from the first Jaime chapter to the last one might be part of this AFfC expansion during the writing.

Then there is the one and only Jaime chapter in ADwD, which is where he meets Brienne and they go missing. It is possible that this chapter was among the 22 full chapters that GRRM reserved to ADwD after he made the split. Or perhaps GRRM had not written this chapter yet when he published AFfC. I think this chapter would have worked well for the final chapter of Jaime in AFfC. We could have done just fine with no Brienne cliffhanger in AFfC.

&gt;A Dance with Dragons - Daenerys VII  
&gt;  
&gt;The old knight inclined his head. “The queen your mother was always mindful of her duty.” He was handsome in his gold-and-silver armor, his white cloak streaming from his shoulders, but he sounded like a man in pain, as if every word were a stone he had to pass. “As a girl, though … she was once smitten with a young knight from the stormlands who wore her favor at a tourney and named her queen of love and beauty. A brief thing.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“What happened to this knight?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“He put away his lance the day your lady mother wed your father. Afterward he became most pious, and was heard to say that only the Maiden could replace Queen Rhaella in his heart. His passion was impossible, of course. A landed knight is no fit consort for a princess of royal blood.”  
&gt;  
&gt;*And Daario Naharis is only a sellsword, not fit to buckle on the golden spurs of even a landed knight*. “And my father? Was there some woman he loved better than his queen?”  
&gt;  
&gt;Ser Barristan shifted in the saddle. “Not … not loved. Mayhaps *wanted* is a better word, but … it was only kitchen gossip, the whispers of washerwomen and stableboys …”  
&gt;  
&gt;“I want to know. I never knew my father. I want to know everything about him. The good and … the rest.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“As you command.” The white knight chose his words with care. “Prince Aerys … as a youth, he was taken with a certain lady of Casterly Rock, a cousin of Tywin Lannister. When she and Tywin wed, your father drank too much wine at the wedding feast and was heard to say that it was a great pity that the lord’s right to the first night had been abolished. A drunken jape, no more, but Tywin Lannister was not a man to forget such words, or the … the liberties your father took during the bedding.” His face reddened. “I have said too much, Your Grace. I—”

The context is important. Dany was about to get married to Hizdahr for peace and she was wondering whether her parents married for duty and what they would do if they were free to marry for love. It is important to know that when GRRM split AFfC and ADwD, Dany’s entire storyline was more or less complete as we have it in ADwD. The only matter was to arrange the timing of the POVs arriving to Meereen, which we now know as the Meereenese Knot. This makes it extremely likely that GRRM wrote Barristan’s historical accounts along with the AFfC chapters. For example, Jaime meets Ser Bonifer Hasty in AFfC and he was the knight Dany’s mother had a crush on as we learn from Barristan in Dany’s POV. There is an intended connection between these Jaime and Dany chapters, which would be contrasted right next to each other if AFfC and ADwD were not split. 

Similarly, there seems to be a connection between the curious dream sequence with Joanna and Barristan’s account of Aerys in her wedding knight. Yes, Joanna mentions Tywin as “your lord father” to Jaime, which might rule out the Lannisgaryen theory for the twins. But at the same time, her other words about Tywin dreaming of things he cannot have regarding his son and daughter might fan the flames of Lannisgaryen theory for the twins. And this would have come right as we learn from Barristan that Aerys wanted Joanna and he took some “liberties” during the bedding after complaining about the lord’s right to first night. Also it is important to remember that at this point, we did not know the date of the wedding. The ongoing assumption was that the twins were conceived during the bedding. 

Plus, there were other clues from ASoS like Jaime thinking of and even suggesting to Cersei that they should openly marry like Targaryens did before; Genna Lannister telling Jaime that he is not the son Tywin left behind; Cersei’s growing pyromania and madness like Aerys; lots of Cersei-wildfire connotations throughout AFfC; a very direct parallel intended between Naerys-Aemon the Dragonknight and Cersei-Jaime; the valonqar prophecy introduced in AFfC which suggests that Jaime will kill another crazy person trying to burn King’s Landing etc.

Only in TWOIAF which came years later, we would learn that the twins were conceived several years after the wedding ceremony, where we would also learn that GRRM brought Joanna and Aerys together within a reasonable distance from Tyrion’s conception. Why he decided to rule out A+J=C&amp;J like this while fanning the flames of A+J=T is anyone’s guess. But before TWOIAF was published, the evidence for the Lannisgaryen twins was much stronger than Tyrion Targaryen yet the latter has always been the popular one among the fandom. 

Finally, why should we care about A+J theories? What is the point of these theories, if it was ever in the plans (or maybe still is)? Truly, there is no reason to introduce some secret Targaryens to the story, especially from the Lannister siblings, unless GRRM has specific purpose for them to play a part in the future. This is where a host of other theories come in. In and of itself, there is no value of A+J. It has to have an application in the story. It cannot simply be “By the way, Aerys was the father of Cersei/Jaime and/or Tyrion” and then nothing comes out of it. There needs to be a purpose. This is where we should ask the question: 

*“Whatever this purpose is, can GRRM make it work without having Jaime, Cersei or Tyrion as the bastards of Aerys; or if it is essential that any of them should have Targaryen blood, does it have to come from Aerys; why can’t an unrevealed, distant Targaryen ancestry for the Lannisters in the female line satisfy whatever the purpose is?*

I think the answer is that at a certain late point in the writing, GRRM realized that the “purpose” is not worth the trouble of introducing more secret Targaryens to the story and he dropped these A+J theories. That does not necessarily mean he dropped the “purpose” as well. Maybe he figured out other ways to have it without jeopardizing the structure of the story with A+J.",asoiaf

And besides that, why did he even let him into the gates with Ned Stark approaching only miles away? Just send him out to attack the Northern army while your own troops hold the city.

Euron delivers a badass line where he says he is the storm.   
  
However, there is a certain castle in Westeros. It is called Storm's End. The end of the storm. AKA Euron's end.  
  
So Storm's End will be the place where Euron (Storm) dies.     
  
I don't know under what circumstances he will be at Storm's End though. Euron is a sorcerer pirate king and Storm's End has an ancient history (spells woven in its walls by the CoTF/Bran the Builder). Maybe this might interest him. Or maybe a Euron-Cersei alliance is formed, and Cersei sends Euron to attack Dany at Storm's End (After she's captured it from fAegon) ?

124,"I've been listening to and reading a lot of stuff about fAegon in the last few years and it seems to me, that most of the conversations focus on either *is he fake or really Rhaegars Son* or *how will his relationship to Daenerys play out*.

Most predictions go into the direction of another ""Dance of the Dragons"" with Dany and Aegon fighting over Westeros and presumably Aegons end through Danys hand / dragons.

&amp;#x200B;

**Actually, I don't think he will get a fiery death!**

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, to get things unclear, I am not quite sure if he is Elias and Rhaegars son. Illyrio Mopatis affection for young Gryff keeps me insecure, but for this part let's go with him as Rhaegars trueborn (and I think it wouldn't even be that important if or if not, for the circumstances of his death). On the other hand, Connington sees in him his old ""friend"" Rheagar and I don't think either that he is that easy to trick in this regard, so who knows!?

&amp;#x200B;

Aegon is described in the books as the perfect prince. Groomed to rule wisely, capable and trained militarily, he is the perfect prince. And so he is praised to a dying Kevan Lannister by Varys.

Currently he is taking the Stormlands and will probabbly march on Kingslanding after taking or defending Storms End - which is at the moment still unclear if he holds it or not. I assume he will take it and establish his rule over the seven kingdoms.

&amp;#x200B;

**The perfect prince will become the perfect king - for a sadly short time.**

&amp;#x200B;

He will heal the wounds of the war of the five kings. He will be loved by the smallfolk, hailed by the nobility, maybe even take the threat in the north seriously and start to raise arms against the Others. But his demise will come. Not from treachery and not from war with Daenerys.

The true tragedy will come from the love of his truest lieutenant - Jon Connington - who wantet nothing more than to set the son of Rhaegar on the iron throne. Abord the Shy Maid Jon got infected with a highly contagious disease and I fear he will pass this illness on to his friends son.

125," In [a recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/c8p1dg/spoilers_adwd_is_the_consensus_among_the/) on Cersei’s Walk of Atonement, a   

number of posts referenced ‘real world’ or ‘modern’ sensibilities and ideas of gender and gender politics. Is it inappropriate for a reader to judge the way women are treated in Westeros as sexist because *we* find it sexist? Is it wrong to view Robert Baratheon as a bad husband because he rapes his wife, when marital rape has only in recent decades become a crime? 

I would argue that, in fact, it is *exactly* how we’re supposed to interpret ASOIAF. 

First, there’s the **textual encouragement to read gender relations in Westeros as problematic**. We have a range of female POV characters who all express different aspects of the prison that stereotypes of ‘women’s roles’ creates. Sansa’s naïve embrace of gendered expectations blinds her to reality in AGOT; Arya dislikes ‘feminine’ activities but is still unhappy and resentful that Sansa masters them and she can’t; Catelyn has been raised to rely on the men in her household to protect her when it comes to war and politics, and she’s out of her depth when those men aren’t there to do so; Cersei has resented being treated differently because of her gender since childhood and in response, has internalised her society’s misogyny to a truly horrifying degree; Brienne’s deepest feelings of failure and humiliation come not from defeat in combat, but from failing to meet the expectation that she will marry.  Both the women who fit in, and the women who don’t, are harmed by the gendered expectations of their society.

We also have men reflecting (occasionally) on the demands their society places on them *as men*. Jaime can’t cry for his father’s death, because his father was the one who told him “tears were a mark of weakness in a man.” Poison is the weapon of women, cowards and eunuchs, according to Pycelle, and according to Victarion, no true man kills with poison.  Robert Baratheon, as a “manly man”, is (according to Varys) ashamed of using the Master of Whisper’s services. 

So we have a range of POV and non-POV characters describing, and at times judging, the gendered roles of their society, and we have a range of female POV characters whose narratives show the problematic nature of those strict gender roles. 

Are we, as readers, still supposed to avoid passing our own judgement on Westerosi gender politics and stereotyping? 

These are not historical texts, they’re books written *in* our time, intended for readers *of* our time. They’re written by **an author who has the same modern sensibilities as his readers**. 

If they *were* historical texts, the men and women in them would behave differently, and this, for me, is the key argument for using a modern lens to look at gender in ASOIAF. 

**The gendered stereotypes in Westeros** ***aren’t*** **historical, they are very modern**. When tears are described as a weakness for men, that’s the 20th century talking. 17th-century English parliamentarians were described as crying too hard to continue their speeches; the Bible and Christian religious documents are littered with references to ‘floods of tears’; medieval epics and historical records are filled with men crying. Poison as a woman’s weapon that real men wouldn’t use? Someone should tell the historical Macbeth and Duncan who poisoned a whole army of Danes rather than meet them in the field. 

Similarly**, Sansa’s naivety, Catelyn’s lack of preparedness, and Cersei’s highly segregated educational experience are 19th or 20th-century gender norms**, not the norms of a society where people wear plate armour and carry crossbows. When Henry VIII went to France on campaign, he made Catherine of Aragorn the “Governor of the Realm and Captain General”, in which capacity she waged a very successful war against the Scots. Cecily Neville travelled with her husband Richard Plantagenet on many of his military campaigns and when he fled England during the War of the Roses she remained behind, successfully furthering the Yorkist cause through her wit, political acumen and persuasive abilities. Noblewomen, or ‘highborn ladies’ in Westerosi terms, were raised and educated to rule, including to defend the castle, during their husband’s absences – which could be frequent and extended. 

Another modern sensibility in ASOIAF is Brienne’s inability to ‘fit in’ and marry because of her size and looks. You know who else was freakishly tall and notably plain of face? Margaret of York, sister of Edward IV, who married the Duke of Burgundy. She didn’t even bring a whole island to the marriage, just better relations with England. The idea that a landed knight like Ronnet Connington would have the slightest hesitation at marrying Brienne of Tarth just over what she looked like only makes sense in a world where ideas of love and marriage are taken from *after* the 19th-century changes to societal views of marriage.   

So is it a modern, external sensibility to see sexism in a woman stripped naked and pelted with refuse for having extra-marital sex? Yes, but also, **it’s the same modern sensibility that everyone in Westeros shares.** 

Cersei doesn’t lie there and do her duty when Robert assaults her: even in the first year of their marriage, she complains, and when he doesn’t take responsibility, she hits him in the face hard enough to chip his tooth. 

We see rapists on their way to the Wall, given a choice between castration and exile, and later Jaime executes a man for attempted rape. Well, medieval times had a variety of severe punishments for rape, but they were hardly ever enforced. The Statute of Westminster declared rape punishable by death, but in the 45 years after it was promulgated, not a single conviction led to execution. More common punishments in medieval Europe that were actually meted out were a year in jail, or a fine. And that’s if there was a conviction: a variety of places imposed restrictions on accusations designed to make it as difficult as possible for women to bring charges, such as requiring them to walk through the town shouting out the details of the assault. Unlike historical times, in Westeros rape is not only against the law, it’s against *a law that is actually enforced*. 

When Brienne is in Renly’s camp, the landed knights pretend to court her, but they’re only trying to win a bet, because who would marry a tall ugly woman who is the sole heir to an island? *All of them*, in medieval times. Would her wearing armour and fighting like a man be deal-breaker? Medieval romances are crowded with women doing just that, to fight on behalf of their fathers or brothers. By medieval standards, Brienne of Tarth is a fairy-tale come to life, not a joke. She’s only a big ugly freak that no man wants to wed viewed through modern expectations of femininity, female beauty, and romantic marriage. 

So yes, it is appropriate to look at Cersei’s Walk of Atonement, Pia’s brutal rape, Baelish’s creepy grooming of Sansa, Tyrion’s murder of Shae, etc etc, through a modern lens of gender politics, sexism and stereotyping, *because Westeros has modern, not historical, gender standards and expectations.* 

TL;DR: Westeros gender norms aren’t historical, they’re modern.",asoiaf
126,"I was re-reading *A Feast for Crows*, and I found her to be entitled, spoiled, and even a little dumb. Yes, her recklessness  is in part due to Doran being secretive about his plans for her, but I was surprised to learn that she is around 24-years-old. She has the emotional and intellectual maturity of a 15-year-old and has shown no interest in actually being a good leader. With the qualities that she was shown to have, she would, in fact, make a terrible ruler. Her plots are a disaster that end up getting people killed.

128,"Here's something that has always bugged me about Cersei - when Jon Arryn was investigating her, she made no move to get rid of him or safeguard herself despite knowing that he was onto her. Now, ofcourse, Cersei isn't the sharpest sword in the armory, but given her paranoia, this complacence doesn't exactly suit her. According to what Pycelle told Tyrion:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Yes,” he whimpered, “yes, Colemon was purging, so I sent him away. **The queen needed Lord Arryn dead, she did not say so, could not, Varys was listening, always listening, but when I looked at her I knew.** It was not me who gave him the poison, though, I swear it.” 

&amp;#x200B;

She clearly got incredibly lucky here. Not only did LF poison Arryn independently, even Pycelle simply read between the lines and made sure that Jon wouldn't survive long enough to tell anyone the truth. She was similarly complacent with Ned and got incredibly lucky once more - but there, atleast she was being somewhat proactive in trying to kill Robert. Her lack of any activity in regards to Jon Arryn seems too stupid to be true. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then I stumbled upon this little gem from AGoT:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“You have been most courteous,” Ned told him. Then, almost as an afterthought, he said, “One last question, if you would be so kind. You mentioned that the king was at Lord Arryn’s bedside when he died. **I wonder, was the queen with him?”**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“Why, no,” Pycelle said. “**She and the children were making the journey to Casterly Rock, in company with her father.** Lord Tywin had brought a retinue to the city for the tourney on Prince Joffrey’s name day, no doubt hoping to see his son Jaime win the champion’s crown. In that he was sadly disappointed. It fell to me to send the queen word of Lord Arryn’s sudden death. Never have I sent off a bird with a heavier heart.”

&amp;#x200B;

Interesting. So just as Jon Arryn was concluding his investigation and getting ready to tell Robert, Cersei found an excuse to ""visit"" the Lannister Stronghold. Presumably for an extended stay. I doubt Pycelle has any reason to lie here, since this alibi is easily verified. So it looks like she was taking some measures to safeguard herself and her children after all. Not the surest way, but I guess its something after all. 

&amp;#x200B;

It might also explain why Cersei doesn't run when Ned gives her the chance. She felt like she had to run once before and it turned out that she didn't need to. ""Fate"" intervened on her behalf to take care of the problem for her. That kind of lucky escape can make someone overconfident. Maybe she believed that she had a mysterious benefactor or maybe she thought that gods were on her side - but still, she felt confident enough that she'd win this round with Ned Stark and guess what - she got incredibly lucky once more.

129,"What do the Others represent in your mind?
I like the Others the show bit about the goal behind them being to wipe out the collective memory of humanity, which Bran represented, and could see that being apart of the books explanation.

I really like to look at the Others starting from the name first.

The Other's is such a great title for a villain faction.
It immediately seperates the White Walkers from ""us,"" the humans, and mirrors our tendency to otherize groups and villainize them, i.e the Wildings, but the Other's are moreso a glitched out analogue to humanity, making them closer to us than not in an exaggerated fashion.

With their inhuman ""human"" laughs/way of battle/brutality/wight slavery, just mismatched parts and all consuming death.

That's one reason I believe has so many characters morally compromised, to beg the quesiton of what humanity is worth and then show the stark difference between the two in how Westeros's warmth overcomes the cold.

Surely cersei wouldn’t be so stupid as to just let it unfold, we know for sure they (cersei/jaime/pycelle) had some knowledge of jon and stannis actions since pycelle lets him die so do you think she would have tried to kill him eventually anyway or would she just let the events unfold as she originally did?",asoiaf
132,"It's been pointed out by Youtuber 'The Dragon Demands' that D&amp;D seem to be fixated on close ups of the main actors emoting without dialogue. As the series progressed from GRRM's material to their own this became more and more prevalent, with the absolute extreme scenario occuring in the final episode (which they directed). We see Tyrion looking at things, crying, shocked and saddened, all with barely any talking whatsoever. In 'The Bells' there was meant to be a 7-minute long take just following Arya and her reactions as the city is destroyed.

The scenes will be full of Cersei smirks, Jon Snow brooding, Arya stares, Tyrion worried faces - so much time dedicated to moments with barely any dialogue at all. with  Why do you think everyone was raving about the acting this season? Don't get me wrong, they're all incredibly talented, but so much of the focus is on non-verbal emoting that all we have to talk about is the performances. Here's a video of S08E06 with all spoken dialogue removed. Almost the entire bloody runtime has no talking. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B44d9QqAqyw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B44d9QqAqyw)

So we come to the strange irony of the last few seasons....they would actually work better as a **book** than as a **show**.  We can't always figure out what's going on in the character's heads from performance alone. Sometimes we need dialogue and actions to help us out. If the internal monologue was written on a page it would be simple, but often it was impossible to tell what was going on.

I point to season 7 episode 7 as an example. Jaime has just informed Cersei that he wishes to desert and ride to winterfell. She looks at The Mountain as some sort of threat that she'll unleash him against her brother(?). Jaime looks back at her horrified. Then she gives a kind of evil stare, he walks towards the mountain (I legit thought he was gonna die at this point) and then just walks past him and out the courtyard, with no consequence. If Cersei had *said* something I would better understand just what the hell Cersei &amp; Ser Gregor were playing at.

134,"The Trident scenes are very important for our understanding several characters (Robert, Joffrey, Arya, Sansa, Sandor Clegane), but we don't often pay much attention to Ned's perspective. What was his game plan?

The dialog when they find Arya shows Ned knows the Lannisters are dangerous to children:

&gt;""They've found her, my lord.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Ned rose quickly. ""Our men or Lannister's?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""It was Jory,"" his steward Vayon Poole replied. ""She's not been harmed.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Thank the gods,"" Ned said. His men had been searching for Arya for four days now, but the queen's men had been out hunting as well. ""Where is she? Tell Jory to bring her here at once.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""I am sorry, my lord,"" Poole told him. ""The guards on the gate were Lannister men, and they informed the queen when Jory brought her in. She's being taken directly before the king …""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Damn that woman!"" Ned said, striding to the door. ""Find Sansa and bring her to the audience chamber. Her voice may be needed."" He descended the tower steps in a red rage. He had led searches himself for the first three days, and had scarcely slept an hour since Arya had disappeared. This morning he had been so heartsick and weary he could scarcely stand, but now his fury was on him, filling him with strength.

&amp;#x200B;

Arya has been gone for four harrowing days, which I think we tend to forget. Arya gives her version of the story, and then Joffrey gives his. Ned calls for Sansa to speak.

&gt;When his son was done talking, the king rose heavily from his seat, looking like a man who wanted to be anywhere but here. ""What in all the seven hells am I supposed to make of this? He says one thing, she says another.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""They were not the only ones present,"" Ned said. ""Sansa, come here."" Ned had heard her version of the story the night Arya had vanished. He knew the truth. ""Tell us what happened.""

&amp;#x200B;

As we all know, Sansa says she doesn't remember.

&gt;His eldest daughter stepped forward hesitantly. She was dressed in blue velvets trimmed with white, a silver chain around her neck. Her thick auburn hair had been brushed until it shone. She blinked at her sister, then at the young prince. ""I don't know,"" she said tearfully, looking as though she wanted to bolt. ""I don't remember. Everything happened so fast, I didn't see …""  
&gt;  
&gt;""You rotten!"" Arya shrieked. She flew at her sister like an arrow, knocking Sansa down to the ground, pummeling her. ""Liar, liar, liar, liar.""

&amp;#x200B;

Jory pulls Arya off Sansa, and then Cersei says she wants Arya punished. Robert refuses. Cersei mentions Joffrey's scars. Robert and Ned agree to punish their own children, and Ned is vastly relieved until Cersei demands Lady be killed. You all know the rest.

Before we think about Ned's decisionmaking, it's important to know two things:

1. Sansa saw Arya hit Joffrey with a stick in the back of the head after Joffrey had cut Mycah's face and threatened him but before Joffrey had done anything else. Joffrey then savagely attacks Arya, and Nymeria intervenes.
2. The Lannisters were far more dangerous than anyone even thought when we get Jaime's later POV. Cersei wanted him to kill Arya or cut off her hand and fought with Robert over it.

&amp;#x200B;

Given all of this, what was Ned's strategy?

Obviously, I understand why Sansa had to be there in case the court turned against Arya, but why have Sansa speak when Robert was at an impasse? It raises some questions.

Is Ned just treating this like a children's fight?

Did Ned really want Sansa to say she saw Arya hit Joffrey on the back of the head after he cut Mycah? How would the court have reacted to that? Arya was essentially (in the court's view) attacking a crown prince for chastising a small folk boy.

Was Ned really okay with his daughter speaking against her future husband, who would have the power of life and death over her? Did he intend to continue the betrothal? Did he not realize it was a big deal? As it is, I think Joffrey is probably crueler to Sansa because of what happened on the Trident.

What would have happened if Sansa had said what she saw?

What would have happened if Ned never asked Sansa to speak? Would other people have tried to get her to talk about the situation.

Was it a better or worse outcome that there was no confirmation of Joffrey's or Arya's stories either way?

141,"Stannis acquired 4/5 of Renly's twenty thousand strong cavalry to make his 21k host. That means he got 16, 000 men from Renly. One assumes that these were the Florents and the Storm lords; who joined Stannis as their new leige lord. House florent fields 2000 men meaning Stannis got 14000 Stormlanders.

We learn that Stannis loses his men due to defections and the fact that he had to leave them behind at the Blackwater. 

Dontos tells Sansa of that the city how the city has been delivered:

&gt;“They came up through the ashes while the river was burning. The river, Stannis was neck deep in the river, and they took him from the rear. Oh, to be a knight again, to have been part of it! **His own men hardly fought, they say. Some ran but more bent the knee and went over, shouting for Lord Renly!** What must Stannis have thought when he heard that? I had it from Osney Kettleblack who had it from Ser Osmund, but Ser Balon’s back now and his men say the same, and the gold cloaks as well.

Captain Khorane told Davos of the war.

&gt;Captain Khorane had told him of the end of Stannis’s hopes, on the night the river burned. The Lannisters had taken him from the flank, and **his fickle bannermen had abandoned him by the hundreds in the hour of his greatest need.** “King Renly’s shade was seen as well,” the captain said, “slaying right and left as he led the lion lord’s van. It’s said his green armor took a ghostly glow from the wildfire, and his antlers ran with golden flames.”

Here we see that hundreds of Stannis vassals turned coat when Renly's ghost shows up.

And we later see that Stannis is left with only fifteen hundred men.

&gt;Ser Axell proposed to use Salladhor Saan’s fleet and the men who had escaped the Blackwater—Stannis still had some fifteen hundred on Dragonstone, more than half of them Florents—to exact retribution for Lord Celtigar’s defection.

So Stannis strength goes down from 21,000 to 1500. That should mean that Stannis lost most of his 14000 Stormlanders as well. Later in AFfC we see that Jaime leads a small host of less than a thousand men half of whom are lannister men and the rest being recent foes turned friends; the Stormlords like Red Ronnet, Dermot of the Rainwood and Bonnifer Hasty joining him. 

&gt;Forty knights and as many esquires awaited him outside the Red Keep’s stables. Half were westermen sworn to House Lannister, the others recent foes turned doubtful friends. Ser Dermot of the Rainwood would carry Tommen’s standard, Red Ronnet Connington the white banner of the Kingsguard.

And 

&gt;The greater part of his command awaited him beyond the city walls; Ser Addam Marbrand with his outriders, Ser Steffon Swyft and the baggage train, the Holy Hundred of old Ser Bonifer the Good, Sarsfield’s mounted archers, Maester Gulian with four cages full of ravens, two hundred heavy horse under Ser Flement Brax. Not a great host, all in all; fewer than a thousand men in total. Numbers were the last thing needed at Riverrun.

Jaime III.

So that accounts for only about five hundred Stormlanders. We know that Stannis should have a few(less than 750) of the Stormlands horse in his 1500. We also know that the Stormland infantry remained with the sixty thousand that Loras takes for his own host. We however don't see what becomes of rest of them.

&gt;We had come late to Robert's cause. It was necessary to demonstrate our loyalty. When I laid those bodies before the throne, no man could doubt that we had forsaken House Targaryen forever.

Its hard to fault this reasoning from a practical standpoint. House Lannister had come late, the babes were a problem, and Robert would only cement himself as the evil Usurper had he bloodied his own hands. Of course, Robert should have publicly condemned the brutal killing rather than saying 'dragonspawn' whilst privately rewarding Tywin (i feel ill talking about this).

But Tywin even highlights himself:

&gt;I grant you, it was done too brutally. Elia need not have been harmed at all, that was sheer folly. By herself she was nothing.

Again this makes pragmatic sense. Elia by herself doesnt exactly have a strong claim to kingship and if anything she would prove a useful hostage as Dorne was not yet subdued. Yet he completely omits her when giving orders.

Thus far i see two possibilities, one is that he didnt actually expect Elia to be in the Nursery. This makes no sense as Elia was all but confirmed to be in Maegor's holdfast and Tywin served under Aerys for years, he would understand that Aerys in his paranoid nature would want to keep Elia close as a 'hostage' guaranteeing future Dornish loyalty.

The other is he 'trusted' Gregor not to do her harm. This is supported by:

&gt;Nor did I yet grasp what I had in Gregor Clegane, only that he was huge and terrible in battle.

I dont get this, Tywin handpicked two men to go murder children. How could he not understand what he had with them? Not just ordinary children, but two very valuable ones. Think about it, the Rebellion is not yet finished. The Reach and Dorne remain loyal to the Targaryens, as interrogation would soon tell them Viserys and Rhaella had fled to Dragonstone. Kings Landing is in chaos. The two children could be slipped out or replaced with others and sold to the loyalists without too much trouble. Rhaenys in particular as she has Dornish looks. So clearly he knew two things, that they were cruel and stupid. Stupid enough not to see the potential value in the children, and cruel enough to murder children with no questions asked. How can he rightly be 'surprised' when Gregor does something both stupid and cruel? Those are the two character traits you were counting on.

But why omit Elia completely? Even with the other 'pressing' concerns of Jaime's safety and Ned Stark's van, Elia remains an extremely valuable hostage. Sure she has no claim to the Iron Throne, but she is highly valuable to the Dornish and could very easily help secure Robert's throne as the Rebellion's victory is not yet a sure thing. All it takes is a cursory mention of 'take Elia hostage'. If proving loyalty to Robert was a concern, taking Elia as a hostage is hardly a detriment.

In some ways I'm inclined to believe Oberyn's reasoning. Tywin Lannister 'is not a man to forget such slights.' The Reynes, Tarbecks, Aerys, even Tyrion all learnt this. I think Tywin omitted Elia not out of forgetfulness, but out of spite. He didn't care what happened to her. The omission was intentional, he may even have given the orders for her to be killed. In omitted Elia in his orders, he intentionally signed her death warrant knowing full well what he had in his men.",asoiaf

147,"One of the things I was sorry not to get more than a brief flashback of was the end of Robert's Rebellion: Jaime Lannister killing Aerys, and Ned Stark riding into the Great Hall to find him on the Iron Throne. 

There are two main POV descriptions of it, one from Ned Stark in AGOT and one from Jaime in ASOS and I find it fascinating to read them in light of each other (especially given these are recollections fourteen years later by two men who were 19 and 17 respectively at the time).

&amp;#x200B;

AGOT Eddard II

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""I cannot answer for the gods, Your Grace … only for what I found when I rode into the throne room that day,"" Ned said. ""Aerys was dead on the floor, **drowned in his own blood**. His dragon skulls stared down from the walls. **Lannister's men were everywhere. Jaime wore the white cloak of the Kingsguard over his golden armor. I can see him still. Even his sword was gilded. He was seated on the Iron Throne, high above his knights, wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lion's head. How he glittered**!""  
&gt;  
&gt;""This is well known,"" the king complained.  
&gt;  
&gt; ""I was still mounted. **I rode the length of the hall in silence, between the long rows of dragon skulls**. It felt as though they were watching me, somehow. I stopped in front of the throne, looking up at him. **His golden sword was across his legs, its edge red with a king's blood.** My men were filling the room behind me. Lannister's men drew back. **I never said a word. I looked at him seated there on the throne, and I waited. At last Jaime laughed and got up. He took off his helm, and he said to me, 'Have no fear, Stark. I was only keeping it warm for our friend Robert. It's not a very comfortable seat, I'm afraid.'""**  
&gt;  
&gt;The king threw back his head and roared. His laughter startled a flight of crows from the tall brown grass. They took to the air in a wild beating of wings. ""You think I should mistrust Lannister because he sat on my throne for a few moments?"" He shook with laughter again. ""Jaime was all of seventeen, Ned. Scarce more than a boy.""  
&gt;  
&gt; **""Boy or man, he had no right to that throne.""**   
&gt;  
&gt; ""Perhaps he was tired,"" Robert suggested. ""**Killing kings is weary work. Gods know, there's no place else to rest your ass in that damnable room.** And he spoke truly, it is a monstrous uncomfortable chair. In more ways than one."" The king shook his head. ""Well, now I know Jaime's dark sin, and the matter can be forgotten.""  

&amp;#x200B;

What I find interesting about this is that Ned remembers the dead king using a poetic, noble cliche of being drowned in his own blood. He clearly remembers Jaime wearing his golden, Lannister armour, including a helm in the shape of his house sigil, as well as his white Kingsguard cloak, and the detail of Jaime's sword being red with the king's blood tells us that Jaime's sword was *unsheathed* across his knees, the traditional posture of a lord preparing to refuse guest right to a visitor. Also, he's surrounded by Lannister forces, while Ned's men are still arriving behind him. 

From this perspective, Ned's silence is very much that of a man who knows the situation is on a knife's edge. Has Jaime taken the throne for himself? The bared blade is a sign he's prepared to refuse it. And Ned, unlike Robert who wasn't there, has carried this as Jaime's worst offence, the ultimate reason Robert shouldn't trust him. Robert absolutely doesn't take it seriously: Jaime was just a kid, maybe he wanted to sit down, who cares after all this time? But Ned, at the time, absolutely thought Jaime was seriously considering refusing the throne to Robert, and took his silence (until he broke the tension with a joke) as a threat.  

Then we come, several books later, to how Jaime remembers it:

ASOS Jaime II

 

&gt; Jaime had slipped in through the king's door, clad in his golden armor, sword in hand. ***The golden armor, not the white, but no one ever remembers that. Would that I had taken off that damned cloak as well.***  
&gt;  
&gt;When Aerys saw the blood on his blade, he demanded to know if it was Lord Tywin's. ""I want him dead, the traitor. I want his head, you'll bring me his head, or you'll burn with all the rest. All the traitors. Rossart says they are inside the walls! He's gone to make them a warm welcome. Whose blood? Whose?""  
&gt;  
&gt; ""Rossart's,"" answered Jaime.   
&gt;  
&gt; Those purple eyes grew huge then, and the royal mouth drooped open in shock. He lost control of his bowels, turned, and ran for the Iron Throne. **Beneath the empty eyes of the skulls on the walls, Jaime hauled the last dragonking bodily off the steps, squealing like a pig and smelling like a privy. A single slash across his throat was all it took to end it.** So easy, he remembered thinking. A king should die harder than this. Rossart at least had tried to make a fight of it, though if truth be told he fought like an alchemist. Queer that they never ask who killed Rossart . . . but of course, he was no one, lowborn, Hand for a fortnight, just another mad fancy of the Mad King.   
&gt;  
&gt; Ser Elys Westerling and Lord Crakehall and others of his father's knights burst into the hall in time to see the last of it, so **there was no way for Jaime to vanish and let some braggart steal the praise or blame.** It would be blame, he knew at once when he saw the way they looked at him . . . though perhaps that was fear. Lannister or no, he was one of Aerys's seven.   
&gt;  
&gt; ""The castle is ours, ser, and the city,"" Roland Crakehall told him, which was half true. Targaryen loyalists were still dying on the serpentine steps and in the armory, Gregor Clegane and Amory Lorch were scaling the walls of Maegor's Holdfast, and Ned Stark was leading his northmen through the King's Gate even then, but Crakehall could not have known that. He had not seemed surprised to find Aerys slain; Jaime had been Lord Tywin's son long before he had been named to the Kingsguard.   
&gt;  
&gt; ""Tell them the Mad King is dead,"" he commanded. ""**Spare all those who yield and hold them captive.""**   
&gt;  
&gt; ""Shall I proclaim a new king as well?"" Crakehall asked, and Jaime read the question plain: Shall it be your father, or Robert Baratheon, or do you mean to try to make a new dragonking? **He thought for a moment of the boy Viserys, fled to Dragonstone, and of Rhaegar's infant son Aegon**, still in Maegor's with his mother. *A new Targaryen king, and my father as Hand. How the wolves will howl, and the storm lord choke with rage.* For a moment he was tempted, until he glanced down again at the body on the floor, in its spreading pool of blood. **His blood is in both of them, he thought. ""Proclaim who you bloody well like**,"" he told Crakehall. Then he climbed the Iron Throne and seated himself with his sword across his knees, to see who would come to claim the kingdom. **As it happened, it had been Eddard Stark.** 

ASOS Jaime VI

&gt; He remembered Eddard Stark, riding the length of Aerys's throne room **wrapped in silence. Only his eyes had spoken; a lord's eyes, cold and grey and full of judgment.** 

&amp;#x200B;

So for Jaime, the detail that he'd worn his golden armour and not the white should, he thinks, go some way towards mitigating people's opinions of what he did. He even thinks that if he'd taken the Kingsguard cloak off, people wouldn't view him as being quite so bad. Ned judged Jaime on his *acts*, but Jaime thinks *appearances* are as key. 

When he reflects on killing Aerys, it's distinctly *not* romanticised. (They never tell you how they all shit themselves). I don't think the 'pig' in the sentence before Jaime cutting the Mad King's throat is an accident: he slaughtered his king with as much ceremony and honour as a farmer slaughtering a hog. Of course, at this point, we don't know as readers the full catalogue of the Mad King's atrocities, or that Jaime has spent two years being forced to witness them, but this is an early sign that to Jaime, by then, Aerys was no longer king or even really human. (You could argue that this was a mechanism for Jaime to depersonalise the man he was about to murder, but nothing in Jaime's POV chapters indicates he needs to do that in order to kill people).  For Ned, the Mad King was still king, dying drowning in blood. For Jaime, he's an animal to be put down. 

Then we have Jaime discovered with Aerys still bleeding out, and an indication that he'd least considered the possibility he might get away with it undiscovered. He doesn't seem to have a plan, other than that, so now he has to wing his way through brazening it out. He takes charge, giving orders that might end the fighting without two much more bloodshed; he considers fucking everything up for the sheer fun of it by claiming the Iron Throne for one of the last two Targareyans, but ""his blood is in both of them"" - another early indication that Aerys is much, much worse than we know, because Aegon is the son of a man Jaime likes and not the product of Targareyan incest, so quite possibly a safe bet. Finally, he washes his hands of the decision verbally at precisely the moment he *acts* to make it his decision unilaterally, by sitting on the throne with his sword across his knees. But being Jaime, he doesn't think about that *at all*, or even vaguely reflect on how that's going to look to anyone else. 

Finally, from a different chapter, we have Jaime's POV of Ned's silent ride. That recollection comes in the middle of a dream in which the dead ride silently - without even a hoofbeat or the clink of a bridle - and that it's what occurs to Jaime *immediately* gives more weight to the silence. There's no way Ned rode a horse over a stone floor in utter silence, but Jaime felt *Ned's* silence so heavily it was the only thing that mattered. And while Ned, in his recollection, seems to me to have been unsure of how things would play out (and very reasonably not wanting to have to fight Jaime Lannister and a bunch of Lannister men), Jaime *immediately* takes Ned's silence as judgement, just as he immediately sees 'blame' in the faces of the Lannister men who discover him killing the king. And he resents it: Ned's eyes aren't just 'grey and full of judgement' but '*cold* and grey'

As we know from Ned's POV, he responds after a moment by cracking a joke. 

And he's going to go on cracking jokes as a defence mechanism for the next fourteen years - as Tyrion tells us, ""There was very little that Jaime took seriously. Tyrion knew that about his brother, and forgave it.""

Ned, however, takes everything seriously, and holds onto that moment for the rest of his life. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR The differences in Ned's recollection of the Mad King's death and Jaime's illustrate their different priorities and also, Jaime's lack of awareness at the age of 17 as to how others might interpret his actions.",asoiaf
148,"&gt;She heard a *crack*, the sound of shattering stone. The platform of wood and brush and grass began to shift and collapse in upon itself. Bits of burning wood slid down at her, and Dany was showered with ash and cinders. And something else came crashing down, bouncing and rolling, to land at her feet; a chunk of curved rock, **pale** and veined with **gold**, broken and smoking. The **roaring** filled the world, yet dimly through the firefall Dany heard women shriek and children cry out in wonder.  
&gt;  
&gt;…  
&gt;  
&gt;The dragon came down between the Dornishmen and the door with a **roar** that would have sent a **hundred lions** running.

Viserion’s scales are cream, but his horns, wing bones and spinal crest are gold colored; both colors (gold and pale cream) can be associated with Tyrion’s Lannister background and pale blonde hair. Viserion’s flame is pale gold shot through with red and orange, which looks very similar to the colors of House Lannister (gold and crimson). Following his hatching, roaring filled the world. Viserion’s roar was described to be loud enough to scare a hundred lions. Roaring is highly associated with the lion of Lannister (*Hear me roar*).

&gt;*The fool* was all that he had time to think as the quarrel caromed off Viserion’s neck to vanish in the gloom. A line of fire gleamed in its wake—dragon’s blood, glowing **gold** and **red**.  
&gt;  
&gt;The **crossbowman** was fumbling for another quarrel as the dragon’s teeth closed around his neck.

Viserion’s blood is described using the colors of House Lannister. This occurs when Viserion is fired at with a crossbow, something Tyrion has used and relates to using often throughout ADwD.

&gt;“Your asked it of me. And I have a tender spot in my heart for **cripples** and **bastards** and **broken things**.” Tyrion Lannister placed a hand over his heart and grinned.

Tyrion helped the *bastard* (Jon) and the *cripple* (Bran). Now the only thing remains is a *broken thing*. I believe Viserion will be wounded in the Battle of Meereen and Tyrion will take care of him. That is how he will bond with his dragon.

&gt;“This one understands.” Missandei turned as if to go, then paused a moment and said, “It is said that the Yunkai’i have ringed the city all about with **scorpions**, to loose **iron bolts** into the sky should Drogon return.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Ser Barristan had heard that too. “It is no simple thing to slay a dragon in the sky. In Westeros, many tried to bring down Aegon and his sisters. None succeeded.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Missandei nodded. **It was hard to tell if she was reassured.**  
&gt;  
&gt;...   
&gt;  
&gt;**Scorpions** were cranked upwards to loose **iron bolts** of the sort that had once felled Meraxes in Dorne.

Dorne is a hot and dry place full of sand. Meereen is much the same. The correct account for the death of Meraxes is that an iron bolt loosed by a scorpion slew the dragon. We don’t know much about this particular event but that must be a lucky shot. I think Viserion will get wounded by one of those iron bolts. His condition might also get worse by eating the bodies of the plague victims. This will be the time for Tyrion. He will feed mutton to the dragon, help him recover and finally bond with him similar to Nettles and Sheepstealer.

&gt;**The white** ***cyvasse*** **dragon ended up at Tyrion's feet.** He scooped it off the carpet and wiped it on his sleeve, but some of the Yunkish blood had collected in the fine grooves of the carving, so the pale wood seemed veined with red.   
&gt;  
&gt;“All hail our beloved queen, Daenerys.” *Be she alive or be she dead.* **He tossed the bloody dragon in the air**, caught it, grinned.   
&gt;  
&gt;…  
&gt;  
&gt;He moved his catapult again, closed his hand around **Tyrion’s alabaster dragon**, removed it from the board.

Viserion is the only dragon in the story that can be represented by an alabaster/white dragon cyvasse piece. Note the symbolism of Tyrion taking the bloody dragon piece from the ground, wiping it clean and tossing it to the air. It is a symbolic way of taking care of a wounded dragon and making it fly again. Not only the white dragon is said to belong to Tyrion but also it is implied that Tyrion will lose the mount at one point.",asoiaf
149,"This is something that has been on my mind for a while and I'd like to hear other's thoughts. They obviously cut and changed a large portion of Jaime's story for the show, while Cersei's, and Tyrion's to some extent, have followed the books much more closely. But they cut the valonqar prophecy (and left the other parts of the prophecy in), which is pretty integral to the dynamic between the three Lannister siblings.

So does this mean something? Is the valonqar prophecy ultimately so meaningless in the books that it wasn't in the show? Or is it going to end up being *very* important in the books and couldn't be properly explained in the show's shortened time frame (not that they cared about properly explaining everything else)?

I lean more toward it being important because, again, it so heavily influences Cersei's choices. You could argue that almost everything she's done has been about preventing that prophecy from coming true.

Prior to season 8 I would have said that it was omitted because GRRM wanted to have it be one ""oh shit"" moment that wasn't in the show first. However, Jon killing Dany was an ""oh shit"" moment (or it was supposed to be had it been properly executed) that is just as big, if not bigger, than someone strangling Cersei. So it doesn't really make sense that Jon killing Dany would be included but Jaime (or Tyrion or whoever) killing Cersei wouldn't be.

In ADWD, at the House of Black and White, Arya is tasked to kill an old man in Braavos who swindles ship captains by selling them “insurance”. She notices that he bites each coin to make sure it’s real and kills him by coating a gold coin in poison and switching it out with one from one of his buyers.

&gt; “The golden dragon of Westeros,” said the kindly man. “And how did you come by this? We are no thieves.”

&gt; “It wasn’t stealing. I took one of his, but I left him one of ours.” 

&gt; The kindly man understood. “And with that coin and the others in his purse, he paid a certain man. Soon after that man’s heart gave out. Is that the way of it? Very sad.”
&gt; (The Ugly Little Girl, ADWD)

In the prologue of AFFC, Pate trades “the alchemist” (who is a Faceless Man) a Citadel master key for a golden dragon.

&gt; “Pate grabbed it from his hand. The gold felt warm against his palm. He brought it to his mouth and bit down on it the way he’d seen men do. If truth be told, he wasn’t sure what gold should taste like, but he did not want to look a fool.”

&gt; [Pate] was halfway down the alley when the cobblestones began to move beneath his feet. The stones are slick and wet, he thought, but that was not it. He could feel his heart hammering in his chest. “What’s happening?” he said. His legs had turned to water. “I don’t understand.”
&gt; (Prologue, AFFC)

The Faceless Man uses the same poison on Pate as Arya does on the salesman in ADWD.

This is such a small detail and has very little actual impact on the narrative (besides confirming the fact that it is a Faceless Man in Oldtown), but I’ve reread ASOIAF so many times and have never caught it until now. It blows my mind how intricate and detailed this worldbuilding is. 

GRRM is a genius.",asoiaf
154,"In book 1-5 and show season 1-6, there are always 2 distinct and parallel storylines: Westeros and Essos. The former involved majority of characters and the latter is just about Dany/different people's journey to find her.  
  
However, the last scene in the show about Essos was in S6E10, when Dany appointed Tyrion as her Hand. Then they left Meereen, not a single mention of Essos, Essosi characters at all in S7 and S8.  
  
My issue with that setting is, it single-handed made Dany's character discontinuous. We can even see the ""Essos Dany plotline"" and ""Westeros Dany plotline"" as two separate TV shows, without having any significant impact to both stories. We never know what is her legacy left in the history of Slaver's Bay, Volantis, and the religion of Lord of Light. The short term effect seemed negative, given the ""living hell"" situation of Astapor and the entire siege and plague subplot, but what about long-term?  
  
When we look back at all the 3 season of Meereen plot, we may ask ourselves: ""what's the point of this? We saw no consequences of how society changed after season 6 battle, so we supposed to believe everlasting peace and harmony in Bay of Dragons for a thousand years? I don't think so, if not, why not show how Meereen returned into turmoil, after all, season 8 need something to paint Dany in bad light for her villain plot, the aftermath of Meereen is a golden opportunity and the show missed it.  
  
It is obvious now Samwell Tarly's history book since death of king Robert, A song of Ice and Fire will record the truth of Queen Daenerys Targaryen as a ruthless mass murderer. Westerosi historians in the Citadel will not be kind to her, as she will be remembered as such for generations to come, and rightfully so.  
  
But what about the historical memory in the East?  
  
Take examples from how history textbooks are written in the real world, I predict another biased side of narrators. Large statues and monuments will be built (maybe on top of the Meereen Pyramids? That sounds cool) and historical narratives describe Daenerys as a flawless heroine died in mystery/betrayed by evil Westerosi lords. How would those people in the eastern continent react to Dany's death and her so-called ""mad queen"" reputation in the west? I'm very curious to know. They may just dismiss burning of King's landing as unreliable rumours and Westerosi propaganda, consider how information was perceived in such far away locations, most of the commoners will never know what happened to their queen and how did her die.  
  
There are endless possibilities, unfortunately, the show never provided a satisfying conclusion to that. My question is, will GRRM mention the “aftermath” of Essos, since the Essos plot line is much more complex in the books.  
  
Bu the end of ADWD, millions the salves across the continent already heard the name of Daenerys Targaryen, what she had done in Meereen, and the long-time ""butterfly effect"" is much more than just a few red priests preaching to the crowd. All details indicate those slave cities are on the edge of rebellion. Remember the widow of the waterfront of Volantis, in ADWD: Tyrion VII?  
  
&gt; ""Oh, I think it will be war as well, but not the war they want."" The old woman leaned forward, her black eyes gleaming. ""I think that red R'hllor has more worshipers in this city than all the other gods together. Have you heard Benerro preach?""  
  
&gt; ""Last night.""
  
&gt; ""Benerro can see the morrow in his flames,"" the widow said. ""Triarch Malaquo tried to hire the Golden Company, did you know? He meant to clean out the red temple and put Benerro to the sword. He dare not use tiger cloaks. Half of them worship the Lord of Light as well. Oh, these are dire days in Old Volantis, even for wrinkled old widows. But not half so dire as in Meereen, I think. So tell me, ser … why do you seek the silver queen?""  
  
&gt; ""That is my concern. I can pay for our passage and pay well. I have the silver.""  
  
&gt; Fool, thought Tyrion. It's not coin she wants, it's respect. Haven't you heard a word she's said?  
  
&gt; ""Should you reach your queen, give her a message from the slaves of Old Volantis."" She touched the faded scar upon her wrinkled cheek, where her tears had been cut away. **""Tell her we are waiting. Tell her to come soon.""**  
  
Since we all know how the whole story ends, I simply cannot forget this chapter. It is straight up depressing, **The slaves of Volantis will never saw their long-waited imagery liberator to come**. According to the show season 7-8, it turns out all the build up in the east didn't matter at all, Daenerys will become what she would end up with or without the ""learning how to rule"" plot in Meereen, defeating the whole point of Meereenese Knot.",asoiaf

156,"There are so many wonderful characters in The World of Ice and Fire (not the book but the universe itself). I’m curious as to some of the community’s favorite minor or overlooked characters and why.

Rereading the series I’ve realized how I’d overlooked Rodrick Harlaw, The Reader. Among some delusional and many shortsighted Ironmen Rodrick is quite unique as a lover of the written word. He gives probably the most sage political advice of any of the Ironborn I’ve seen. He rightly told Asha she would fail at the Kingsmoot and defines the need of the Ironborn in practical terms, that is to say land and not Kings. He counsels taking advantage of the political turmoil on the mainland to bring benefit to the Islands, instead of further fruitless attempts at bringing back the Old Ways. Of course it remains to be seen what Euron or Vic will achieve, but this struck me as a uniquely wise viewpoint among the otherwise mostly predictable Ironborn.

With regards to Daenerys IX - Chapter 68. The fact that I already know, by the series and reading as such, knowing how Kal Drogo dies, it still felt so fucking real on the page. But, and I don't know how much it's been talked about(probably ad nauseum) all the dreams and hallucinations of her son and the other dead Targeryens. The fact she sees herself flying on a dragon and burning what can only be King's Landing,(I know there were a few more but forgot, should have reread that chapter before hand) does none of this bare or contradict the visions she has in the House Of the Undying? I always hear and read about those visions and almost never these ones. I'll just say that was one of my favourite chapters thus far in the book. As a caveat, I'll say the last Catelyn chapter(71, Catelyn XI) had me so fucking pumped up when the Greatjon stood there, great sword raised and proclaims Robb, ""King In The North"". (p.s. for some reason, I know she's a smaller character, but I'm loving Maege Mormont. Loving Jeor &amp; Jorah! Goddman are the Mormont's fucking spectacularly written!).   

Now, as with the finale chapter - Daenerys X. I don't know how the rest of you read but, it was if she wasn't sure about stepping into the fire at first, but when she did it was such a great read.

- Will she burn civilians before or after they’ve surrendered? It seems like an oddly specific detail to include in the show, but I really don’t think she has been developed enough in the books to do this after they’ve surrendered. 
- How much of King’s Landing do you think she is going to burn? Perhaps fAegon will hide in the crowd of innocents? 
- Do you think the wildfire will have anything to do with it? As in, will the wildfire caches set off and cause a lot more collateral damage, making her *look* at fault? 
-  Will she burn Meereen in the books? Will those at Volantis convince her that she must “purify non believers” and let the Lord of Light deal with their problems? 
- Will Dany be monstrous enough by the time she gets to Westeros? Will she *want* to burn King’s Landing or will it be something she is conflicted on?",asoiaf
159,"Some excerpts from AWOIAF:

&gt;Casterly Rock, the ancient seat of House Lannister, is no ordinary castle. Although crowned with towers and turrets and watchtowers, with stone walls and oaken gates and iron portcullises guarding its every means of egress, this ancient fortress is in truth a colossal rock beside the Sunset Sea, a rock that some say looks like a lion in repose when the sun sets and the shadows fall.

&gt;The Rock has been measured as **thrice the height of the Wall or the Hightower of Oldtown.** Almost two leagues long from west to east, it is riddled throughout with tunnels, dungeons, storerooms, barracks, halls, stables, stairways, courtyards, balconies, and gardens. There is even a godswood of sorts, though the weirwood that grows there is a queer, twisted thing whose tangled roots have all but filled the cave where it stands, choking out all other growth.

&gt;Casterly Rock has never been taken by storm or siege. No castle in the Seven Kingdoms is larger, richer, or better defended. Legends says that Visenya Targaryen, upon seeing it, thanked the gods that King Loren rode forth to face her brother Aegon on the Field of Fire, for if he had remained within the Rock, **even dragonflame would not have daunted him.**

Hopefully Cersei makes it there after her trial and Tyrion eventually has to put his plumbing knowledge to work Lann the Clever-ing her out of it.",asoiaf

161,"Just officially finished my first re-read. All in all, much more satisfying than the first read, after having read tons of external material from the fandom. It gave me a better appreciation for storylines that just didn't interest me the first time through.

Getting to the Epilogue, wow. I think there's tons of stuff hidden in here, but I enjoyed it so much that I immediately read it again as soon as I finished. So, I'd like to comment about a few of the notes I took on this chapter the 2nd time around.

One thing I noticed was how similar Cersei and Kevan's inner dialogue is about other characters. Not similar in that they think the same things, but that they think other things about these people, but then say something else aloud. The difference being, Cersei's inner dialogue is usually very hateful towards the person. I think it gives a nice contrast between two characters who aimed to be just like Tywin, with neither being an accurate depiction.

&gt;Mace Tyrell was no more than ten years older than Cersei, yet she thought of him as her father’s age, not her own. He was not quite so tall as Lord Tywin had been, but elsewise he was bigger, with a thick chest and a gut grown even thicker. His hair was chestnut-colored, but there were specks of white and grey in his beard. His face was often red. “Lord Tywin was a great man, an *extraordinary* man,” he declared ponderously after he had kissed both her cheeks. “We shall never see his like again, I fear.” 

&gt;*You are looking at his like, fool*, Cersei thought. *It is his daughter standing here before you*. But she needed Tyrell and the strength of Highgarden to keep Tommen on his throne, so all she said was, “He will be greatly missed.”**-Cersei AFFC**

&gt;Tyrell gave a grudging nod. “As you say. My Margaery prefers to be tried by the Faith, so the whole realm can bear witness to her innocence.”

&gt;*If your daughter is as innocent as you’d have us believe, why must you have your army present when she faces her accusers*? Ser Kevan might have asked. “Soon, I hope,” he said instead, before turning to Grand Maester Pycelle. “Is there aught else?” **-Epilogue ADWD**

There's numerous instances of this, mostly about Mace Tyrell, in the Epilogue.

&gt;""...And now we have reports that Connington is moving on Storm’s End.” 

&gt;“If it is Jon Connington,” said Randyll Tarly.

Numerous times Randall Tarly brings up the question of Aegon's legitimacy. I think this is a subtle nod to the fact that Randall will likely support Aegon when he lands, especially after everything in KL has gone to shit. One thing to look out for is when a character tries to write off someone or something, as if to get the other characters to doubt it and just ignore it. I think Tarly is trying to do that here.

&gt;Behind the table where the five members of the king’s small council were seated, **the Iron Throne crouched like some great black beast, its barbs and claws and blades half-shrouded in shadow**. Kevan Lannister could feel it at his back, an itch between the shoulder blades.

I just think this is an interesting description of the Iron Throne. Could it point to anything?

&gt;“At the far end of the world,” said Mace Tyrell. “Queen of Slaver’s Bay, aye. She is welcome to it.”

&gt;“On that we can agree,” Ser Kevan said, “but the girl is of the blood of Aegon the Conqueror, and I do not think she will be content to remain in Meereen forever. If she should reach these shores and join her strength to Lord Connington and this prince of his, feigned or no … **we must destroy Connington and his pretender now, before Daenerys Stormborn can come west.”**

I was asking myself, why Varys would want Kevan and Pycelle dead. Sure, Pycelle gives him ""for the good of the realm/children"" speech as he is dying, but numerous people have questioned Varys' motives in that regard.

I can't help but think one of the main reasons Varys throws a wrench into the system is because he does not think Aegon can outright win against the Iron Throne as it stands. Kevan was going to wipe the plate with him.

&gt;he would have no choice but to pay the crown’s debts with Lannister gold. He dare not resort to new taxes, not with the Seven Kingdoms crawling with rebellion.

This mirrors what Tywin Lannister did when he was Hand off the King to Aerys. Though, probably for very different reasons.

&gt;The Grand Maester consulted his papers. “We should address the **Rosby inheritance. Six claims have been put forth**—”

I'm sure this has been discussed in detail, but who are the claimants?

The next thing I noticed is how differently Kevan notes Cersei is acting.

&gt;His niece had been subdued and submissive since her walk of atonement, thank the gods.

Then,

&gt;...she spent a third of her waking hours with her son, another third in prayer, and the rest in her tub. **She was bathing four or five times a day, scrubbing herself with horsehair brushes and strong lye soap**, as if she meant to scrape her skin off.

That's a peculiar act.

But let's not forget what her appearance is like now.

&gt;The queen was dressed as modestly as any matron, in a dark brown gown that buttoned up to her throat and a hooded green mantle that covered her shaved head.

[Well then.](https://youtu.be/wSJSWy2o_1I)

&gt;Ser Boros Blount was in attendance on the boy king and his mother when Ser Kevan entered the royal chambers. Blount wore enameled scale, white cloak, and halfhelm. He did not look well. Of late Boros had grown notably heavier about the face and belly, and his color was not good. And he was leaning against the wall behind him, as if standing had become too great an effort for him.

Then we have the obvious, slow poisoning of Ser Boros Blount.... Or he's just gaining weight and becoming unhealthy because he has to taste all of Tommen's food, which is mostly sweets?

&gt;“The bad cat was outside my window last night,” he informed Kevan at one point, “but Ser Pounce hissed at him and he ran off across the roofs.” 

&gt;“The bad cat?” Ser Kevan said, amused. He is a sweet boy. 

&gt;“An old black tomcat with a torn ear,” Cersei told him. “A filthy thing, and foul-tempered. He clawed Joff’s hand once.” She made a face. “The cats keep the rats down, I know, but that one … **he’s been known to attack ravens in the rookery.”**

Here, the famous black cat, Baleron, shows up once again. I know there's theories about the cat having been skin-changed by someone, but I also wonder if that someone mistrusted the Maesters? Who could that be? And on that note, is Ser Pounce also skin-changed by someone, or are these cats metaphorical foreshadowing of some future event?

&gt;“Your wife … do you mean to bring her to court?”

Cersei is interested if Kevan's wife will join them at court. Why is this?

After his supper with Cersei, they are interrupted by a page informing him that Pycelle has a message for him. The first thing Kevan sees is the large, white raven of the Citadel. Intended to announce the changing of the seasons.

However, it donned on me, that no one at KL, besides Varys and his Little Birds, knows that it is now Winter. Just a little tidbit I was wondering if it would mean anything.

&gt;He stood in a pool of shadow by a bookcase, plump, pale-faced, round-shouldered, clutching a crossbow in soft powdered hands. Silk slippers swaddled his feet.

This description of Varys gave me chills. What a truly terrifying sight. You've just been shot in the chest, and here stands the plump former Master of Whispers, who couldn't hurt a fly, wielding the crossbow that hit you. With powdered hands and slippered feet. 

&gt;Someone somewhere will find a way to blame the Dornishmen.

During his King Aegon speech, Varys says this line about what will happen as a result of Kevan's death. I wonder who will blame the Dornish and what it will mean?

Anyway, this chapter was an absolute delight on my second time around. At a time where I was just trying to finish my re-read, this chapter really made me stop and slow down again, and look at the details.

Tldr: A few tidbits of information that I thought may be suspect in the Epilogue. Feel free to address any or all of them. No real angle.",asoiaf
162,"The following quote is from his farewell letter of TWD comic issue #193:

*""Some of the BEST episodes of Game of Thrones are when they're structured in such a way and paced to perfection that your brain can't tell if it's been watching for 15 minutes of 50... and when the end comes... you're STUNNED.""*",asoiaf
163,"Daenerys will burn King's Landing. It is know. Is a event that has a lot of chances to happen in the books. 

However, a sector of the fandom created a theory that such a tragedy would be...a accident caused for Dany's recklessness and lack of knowledge about the Wildfire rather than a conscious choice. 

I dislike that theory, strongly. 

The arguments used for it is that Dany wouldn't be able to kill so many innocents, but this is the same girl that sacrificed a woman that just got revenge on the warlord that killed her town and whose men raped her and her loved ones. The girl that ends Dance by embracing Fire and Blood and is tempted for it. 

Dany will burn King's landing and it would be a totally her choice. Likely a choice that she would regret right after the fact, but it would be HER choice. Honestly, I theorize that the show events will happen and that losing her loved ones, especially stuff as Missandei being executed, which would make a Daenerys that is already willing to use violence go even further. 

Danerys will burn all those people, she might even know about the Wildfire catches and don't care, but ultimately, Daenerys Targaryen would be willing to burn thousands. 

But, why Daenerys killing so many civilians SHOULD NOT be a accident? What if the point of the story is that Dany was always a well meaning heroine that is seen as a new Mad King for the --fundies-- I mean, Westerosi Lords?

Well, I will be blunt, that's lame. 

Daenerys killing thousands serves a purpose in the narrative. Is the moment where she being so distant from all other characters serves a purpose. We saw Dany being a heroine that takes down slavery and tries her best to free people.

But Daenerys' invasion of Westeros is a invasion. Is a foreign army coming to attack a land that is under the biggest crisis of their generation to put the daughter of a dynasty that fell due to their own stupidity and cruelty.  

Daenerys' burning of Westeros is the moment where you have to sit down and think ""Holy Shit, this little girl become the new Maegor the Cruel?"". Makes even more sense when you think in the Five Years Gap, where Daenerys would look even more like a fantasy evil queen. 

Not that Dany would lose all redeeming traits, she would have done her best in Essos, she would have fought against the Others and their Long Night and nevernding winter. Dany would be a heroine. But remember this quote and apply it to Daenerys. 
 
&gt;A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. You were a hero and a smuggler.”

Daenerys would be a heroine in Essos, but in Westeros, she would be the fearsome Daenerys The Cruel, the worst threat that the Seven Kingdom have faced, the biggest single mass murderer of her generation. 

Also, a corolary. What about Jon?

Jon will kill Dany, the Ship Tease (...ship, Har!) between the two is strong in both book and show, being outright canonical in the later. However, the ending of the couple in the show was pretty grim, Jon killing Daenerys, thus stopping the Stallion That Mounts The World and her burning crusade. 

Now, I agree with /u/YezenIRL and his that Book!Jon will do it not due to a purely altruist desire, but rather doing it thinking mostly or uniquely on his family. (Also, I expect that Jon's story  would become a myth that would make ""him"" a new Azor Ahai-like figure, a Altruist Hero that killer her Beloved, moved for his Honor to save the world. Bonus point if Dany also embraces a Azor Ahai role after meeting Red Priests. Oh the Irony would be big). But this is the think, Jon's story ends with him killing someone that he loves and suffering emotionally for it. 

If Daenerys' killed so many people as a accident...Jon comes off as a idiot that don't listen the truth. 

Add Cersei too. I expect her to be killed in Dany's rampage, she wouldn't be Queen when that happens, but she might try to escape during the burning of King's Landing. Add Jon Con who I also expect to die during the Burning.

Daenerys killing King's Landing as a accident don't creates a tragedy. It makes everyone look like unlucky idiots.",asoiaf

&gt;GRRM had no problem with Elio's design of House Vance heraldry, where the dragons have four legs, instead of two legs like the Targ dragons. He might even come up with the suggestion that possibly there had once been a breed of dragon that had four legs. Though Elio didn't remember clearly that's George or his own suggestion.

* CCCB Kosmopolis Interview [July 2012](https://vimeo.com/51124293)

&gt;*The meaning of ice and fire?*  
&gt;  
&gt;Well, ice is frozen water. And fire, fire is the result of combustion when a substance unites with oxygen and gives off heat and energy. But are they hate and love and these other things? Yeah of course. I'm working on a number of levels there and I've always loved a certain amount of ambiguity words or scenes or sequences, and books that can be read in many different ways, that have several meanings when you look at them, that mean one thing when you look at them this way, and another thing when you're looking them the other way. Ice and fire course are also opposites, they're a duality and there's a lot in my books that are about duality. Certainly the religion of Melisandre, one of the most important characters, I think is basically a dualist religion with the premise that there are two gods. It's somewhat based on Zoroastrianism, and a little bit based on Catharism, Albigenses heresy who I know had some roots here in Spain once upon a time, before they were all killed. The idea of a world divided between good and evil war between the two, which is so basic to so many fantasy starting with Tolkien, but much more so in the case of Tolkien imitators, was something that I wanted to recast and think about and maybe subvert a little. But I'm still using kind of the language of it, and some of the symbols associated with it. So all of these are grist for the mill, it's not something as simple as saying ice is this and fire is that. They're both many things. **And one of the most important things is that both of them, ice and fire will kill you dead.** So they're both dangerous in their own ways, hate, love, desire, coldness, they can both be deadly.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Game is one of the themes central to the song of ice and fire, and I would like you to talk about that idea of ​​playing and also playing with readers*  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes it's true. I've played games all my life from when I was a child growing up in Bayonne New Jersey. I played checkers and Monopoly and later on chess. I got to be quite good at chess or relatively good at chess and so much so that I was captain of the chess team in college, and then for few years when I got out of college I made my living directing chess tournaments. In more recent decades I got involved with role-playing games and had a whole group in in Albuquerque New Mexico once had to say where I live of other writers that I did bro playing games with Melinda Snodgrass, Walter John Williams, Victor Milan, the late great Roger Zelazny, all of them were were part of my gaming group at various points . I mean you haven't lived until you've role played with Roger Zelazny. And the wild card series that I've edited for more than 20 years grew out of that. Games have figured in much of my fiction, I've written a couple of chess stories, and of course I have titled *A Game of Thrones* ""A Game of Thrones"". I've also titled the overall series of course *A Song of Ice and Fire.* Song is another motif that's occurred in a lot of my titles, going all the way back to *A Song for Lya*and *Songs of Stars and Shadows* and etc etc. We played a lot of games as human beings. Politics, I think, is. Someone once described it as the most exciting game there is. Speaking of chess, there used to be a fashion among the royalty of Europe to have chess games with living pieces, where the French kings, and perhaps the Spanish kings for all I knew, would dress up their courtiers as kings and queens, and have a huge chess board set up on a lawn and move the pieces around, and have a living chess game. I actually did that myself. My fans put together one of those at the worldcon in California a few years ago, and they dressed it up as one side was the Dornish and the other side was the Tyrells of Highgarden. And Daniel Abraham and I were the two players, and we moved the pieces around, and I won. But that's almost a metaphor, I mean, the truth is that kings and presidents and premiers and prime ministers and all of our leaders from time immemorial have played real games, games of power in which the stakes are human lives and the destiny of nations. And you know, games are sort of formalized competition, but our lives are a competition. and I certainly try to reflect that in in my writing and in something like Ice and Fire. Tyrion is acutely aware of it, you know, he despite being born to a position of power and and wealth, he's aware that, he's competing for everything there is, and he has to be on his toes at all time. and I see that in life too, so I do try to reflect it in my in my books.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Why choose love as the topic of* Dying of the Light *to start your career?*  
&gt;  
&gt;I think it does have something to do with who we are or who I am, and the experiences that a writer undergoes in his own life. There may be some aspiring writers in this group who wanted to do novels or short stories of your own. One of the things that you will probably hear from a lot of teachers and people who give advice to aspiring writers is, write what you know. At least in in the United States, in English literature, this is something always said to aspiring writers: write what you know. When I was a young writer I hated hearing that, because I didn't know anything really. I was this kid from the projects in Bayonne New Jersey. I had never gone anywhere, and didn't have any money. I wanted to write fantasy and science fiction, but I had certainly never seen a dragon, I'd never gone to another planet, I've never done any of this stuff, so how could I write what I know? So I sort of rejected that and said, well, that's bullshit, I'm not gonna follow that advice. But later, and when I eventually became a writer, I began to understand the truth of that. It's not writing what you know in terms of the care and raising of dragons, it's writing the emotional truth of your own life, and whatever furniture you may put into your story, whether it's a realistic story about what it's like to live in Barcelona in the year 2012 and the day-to-day struggles of life, or whether you're casting it in in a historical context what it was like to live in Spain in 1492, or whatever when the Moors were being kicked out and the Jews were being kicked out and Columbus was discovering America, or whether it's a far distant planet or a fantasy world, the core of it is still what you know in terms of emotional truth. That's what's gonna make the characters come alive, that's what's gonna make it real. Now I have a friend, a contemporary who served in the United States Armed Forces during the Vietnam War, and he had some very traumatic experiences over there. He saw some horrible things, he did some things, he learned a lot about war and the nature of humanity, and it's clear that this these events that happened to him between, you know, roughly the ages of 18 and 22 or 23, became in some ways the defining characteristic of his life, and he has subsequently written a number of books. And some of them are realistic books novels about the Vietnam War novels, about coming home after the Vietnam War, some of them are science fiction books of other wars in a thousand years from now among the stars. But you can read those are the war, those science-fiction books, and you can see that the power in them derives from the fact that he served in the Vietnam War, and he knows what he was talking about, that a core of emotional truth there he's writing what he knows. he's writing from the heart. or from the gut as you might say. and that's what makes his best work so powerful. When he doesn't write about war, I think he produces some very entertaining books, but they don't necessarily have the same power as when he's writing about the subject that he really knows. (*Ed. note: I guess he's Joe Haldeman*) Which brings me back to me, who did not serve in the Vietnam War, who in fact was part of the anti-war movement resisting it. I was at home, I went to college and then I got out of college, and the big defining characteristics of my life in these periods was I had a number of women who broke my heart, and it seems very trivial compared to serving in the Vietnam War, but boy it didn't feel trivial to me and I...the questions of love and romance and sexuality and existential loneliness occupied my mind, and obsessed me for years. And as a result I produced a series of intensely romantic science fiction, short stories and novels about guys who are getting their hearts broken among the stars, including *Dying of the Light,* which i think is the ultimate example of it. So I too was writing what you know, the emotional heart of the book goes back to write what you know.

* *Deeper than Swords* Event [March 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiBPX6ChdtI)

&gt;*What is the state of book technology in Westeros? We see a lot of books, we see paper and volume. Does printing exist or all books written by hand?*  
&gt;  
&gt;Printing does not exist yet, no. It's still all, you know, monks copying things over by hand. Um, we still have a Dark Ages technology, I suppose Dark Ages heading into Middle Ages, um, with some ancient scrolls. Some books are still on scrolls and agree libraries, um, and some are being, uh, now bound and bound in leather. So what we would recognize as ancient books, but it's still more in the illuminated a kind of manuscript stage. There's a larger issue there, which is the in general technology of Westeros. And people have asked me about that, why given this long history as Westeros is so relatively backward, and you know, obviously my answer is that the seasons have a large part of it. When periodically winter comes along and thousands of people starve to death and you know, there's this immensely ruling winter in, you don't know that it's ever going to end. That's going to have an effect on the advancement of progress, so to speak. So that's certainly a part of it. Medical technology is a little more advanced actually, thanks to the order of the maesters.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Well maybe we'll get someone with a printing press coming in from Asshai or something?*  
&gt;  
&gt;That could be, there are various technological levels in Westeros too, according to where you are. I mean, the North, the Stark levels is actually more primitive. When you get down to the Reach and King's Landing, they have much more elaborate armor. They have plate and mail as opposed to a straight chain mail in the North. And then of course, if you get beyond the Wall, they're pretty well Stone Age though, their axes made of stone and then bone, and boiled leather outfits except what they can steal from people that they've killed. And you're seeing an across the narrow sea and the cities of the east and all that. Also, once again, different technological levels, which I think some writers forget about and fantasy. And I tried not to forget about it. I mean, we still have, we live in 21st century America, and we're pretty advanced. But you know, I did a shoot in Morocco, when I visited a shooting in Morocco a few years ago and went into Marrakesh, and you get in the inside of Marrakesh, you don't feel that you're in the 21st century. You feel it, you know, Ali Baba and the 40 thieves, we're right around the corner there. And we still have Stone Age tribes in Papua New Guinea. So even on today's earth, hidden in this age of social media and computers and television, the global societies is not a global society, are still pockets of different technological levels that exist all over the earth. And that's certainly much true in Westeros and Essos and my world in general. I'm showing in some of Arya chapters that I've written for the book, you see that in Braavos there a little more advanced with stage of drama. They're actually developing the Elizabethan stage play, you know, fully acted play as well. Back in Westeros proper, you still got mummers hitting each other would bladders and running around and doing forces. But they're looking for Shakespeare and Marlowe in Braavos and some of the other Free Cities. So that's why I'm trying to get to this kind of suggestion of a world with many different societies and many different cultures where things are in a constant state of change.

* GOT 307 Commentary Track. Feb 2014

&gt;Scenes not in GRRM's original script: Robb &amp; Talisa, Joff &amp; Tywin, Jaime &amp; Brienne, Theon &amp; Ramsay  
&gt;  
&gt;Scenes in GRRM's original script but got moved to the next episode: Dany met with the sellsword company, Sam &amp; Gilly met the Others.  
&gt;  
&gt;The original script title was *Autumn Storms,* and there was rain and practically every scene which replicates what's going on in the books about this point. As people are marching, there's snow in the north, and further south there's pouring driving rains, the rivers are overflowing, their banks the roads are turning to seas of mud. All of this is slowing down people. And of course we have a lot of scenes in the rain. After the shot, Dan Weiss called me up and said, ""Do something about that title George, we didn't actually have any rain.""...And then for a while this episode was titled *Chains,* after the golden chain Tyrion gives Shae and the affected Gendry's in chains and Jon is kind of in a quasi prisoner thing with the wildling, so there was a lot of imprisonment themed going on. But once we move the the bear fight into this episode, you know, *the bear and the maiden fair* is the obvious and overwhelming title choice, the other titles went away.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[On Gendry &amp; Mel scene\] In the books Gendry remains with the Brotherhood without banners continuously, because Robert the late King, his father had many bastards, and one of them is already on Dragonstone, a character named Edric Storm. Dave &amp; Dan simplifying it, combined the function of Gendry and Edric storm, eliminating the Edric Storm character, which means that Melisandre had to go and get Gendry. So we had that scene in the previous episode where she shows up on horseback and takes him. This scene was in my episode where they come back, and I decided to add the ship sequence.The only way for her to possibly get from Dragonstone deep into the heart of Riverlands was going by ship upriver, and I liked a visual of them coming back and passing the Red Keep, the irony of it, where people been there searching for him there for ages, and now he's passing right under their nose and they have no idea. And then the visual of the castle gave a great way to sell their relationship in a kind of dramatic way.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[On Theon scene\] I have absolutely nothing to do with these Theon scenes. In the books Theon is tortured for years, but he essentially disappears at the end of Book II and doesn't reappear to the beginning of Book V, by which time he's transformed into Reek. So there's some mention in flashback and dialogue of the fact that he's been tortured for several years and essentially broken down. His whole personality broken down and he's lost various bits of his body, some of his teeth, some of his fingers and toes, **other parts, well, I I leave that a little more to the imagination than what we're about to see here**. So now this scene was a hundred percent David and Dan.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[The director said when they filmed that scene, they got into trouble as one of the girls was found to have a Brazilian. And she thought Westeros shouldn't has that tech.\] They do have razors in the Middle Ages. So it's all a matter of fashion and culture. And this of course is a fantasy world, so we don't have to actually match to actual medieval cultures. We have different religions and different gods and different sexual patterns, so anything is possible if we say it's possible, I guess.  
&gt;  
&gt;Osha's backstory of Bruni is something that David and Dan have added. but I suspect that her story in the books is somewhat similar, she just doesn't even talk about it.

* Le Mouv Interview [July 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oqRdBmIwNA)

&gt;*In Game of Thrones, there are battles, wars, blood, violence but it is not that through which the essential story is played out. Everything \[in the story\] plays out through ruses, treason, intelligence – it is our history really.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Oh although it all interests me. I mean battles and Wars interests me - and medieval feasts interest me. And you know I'm creating a whole world here and every facet of it. As I get to it I try to approach it as realistically as I can, but ultimately as I said before, it's it's the human heart in conflict with itself. It's what makes Cersei Lannister the way she is, and is she capable of learning and changing? What drives Dany? With Dany I'm particularly looking at the what effect great power has upon a person. She's the mother of dragons, and she controls what is in effect the only three nuclear weapons in the entire world that I've created . What does it do to you when you control the only three nuclear weapons in the world and you can destroy entire cities or cultures if you choose to? Should you choose to, should you not choose to? These are the issues that fascinate me. I don't necessarily claim to have answers to these. I think exploring the questions is far more interesting than just me giving an answer and saying to the reader, here's the answer, here's the truth. Now think about it for yourself, look at the dilemmas, look at the contradictions, look at the problems, and the unintended consequences. That's what fascinates me.

&gt;*For people who are not familiar with your work, the series takes place in an imaginary world. There is a struggle for control of the kingdom. This dynastic war is essentially one of three main plot lines. There are the other plot lines involving these sort of superhuman characters, and then there’s the exiled Targaryen daughter who seeks the return of her ancient throne. Why those three main plot lines?*  
&gt;  
&gt;Well, of course, the two outlying ones — the things going on north of the Wall, and then there is Targaryen on the other continent with her dragons — are of course the ice and fire of the title, “A Song of Ice and Fire.” The central stuff — the stuff that’s happening in the middle, in King’s Landing, the capital of the seven kingdoms — is much more based on historical events, historical fiction. It’s loosely drawn from the Wars of the Roses and some of the other conflicts around the 100 Years’ War, although, of course, with a fantasy twist. You know, one of the dynamics I started with, there was the sense of people being so consumed by their petty struggles for power within the seven kingdoms, within King’s Landing — who’s going to be king? Who’s going to be on the Small Council? Who’s going to determine the policies? — that they’re blind to the much greater and more dangerous threats that are happening far away on the periphery of their kingdoms.And of course, you can see that all through history. It’s a common dynamic that takes place in history. You know, the Greek city-states, before the birth of Christ, you know, and fighting with each other, squabbling with each other, even as Philip of Macedon built up his armies to conquer them all. But you even see it in modern times, you know — the political struggles of France, under the Third Republic, while the Nazi threat is rising.But the French politicians would almost rather befriend the Nazis than each other. And maybe our lessons in the modern day too. Who knows? I mean, we have things going on in our world right now like climate change, that’s, you know, ultimately a threat to the entire world. But people are using it as a political football instead of, you know … You’d think everybody would get together.This is something that can wipe out possibly the human race. So I wanted to do an analogue not specifically to the modern-day thing but as a general thing with the structure of the book.

* Inside HBO's Game of Thrones Season 3&amp;4 [Nov 2014](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L5WS12G/)

&gt;I knew years before I got to the scene that Robb was going to die. From the beginning he was marked for death. People have said that he should have been a POV character and in retrospect maybe he should have been, because then it would have been even more of a shock, but I always knew he was going to die. I wanted to deconstruct the usual fantasy thing and I had already killed Ned. In 90 percent of fantasies the father is murdered and the son picks up his mantle and avenges him. I wanted a switch, where you seem to be getting the heroic son, but whoops—he’s dead, too. **While writing, I made some other decisions about that scene. Catelyn was going to have to die and the army needed to be destroyed, too.** (*Ed. note: in the 1993 outline, Robb and Cat died at different time.*)When it comes to influences, I avoid looking at a single historical reference or person to create something like Slaver’s Bay. There are certainly elements from the Babylonian and Mesopotamian societies of ancient times. There are Carthaginian and ancient Persian factors. And of course, there is a good deal of purely imaginative creation. The trick is to blend them all together to construct a world that is entirely your own.

&gt;When the question arose about the dragon dance and the dragons killed each other, a subtle hint from GRRM came along that **perhaps this could happen in the current event** as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;Q: One author said, ""the dragon stories are true, not because they show that dragons exist, but because they show that dragons can be defeated."" Is this also a summary of the plot of ASOIF?  
&gt;  
&gt;A: Well, Dany certainly does not agree that dragons can be defeated. Well, **maybe we will know that in the future**.Then GRRM leans back and does not say anything for a few moments.

&gt;Jaime was with Jon Darry when Chelsted died. Then Jon died at the Trident, so it’s a month from Chelsted’s death to Rosssart’s. But in Jamie’s memory Rossart was Hand for a fortnight.Elio discussed the isssue with Anne and George, ""we did in fact stick with Rossart being made Hand after the Trident... but it is *not* explcitly coupled with the date of Chelsted's ﻿death. That is, the solution we struck upon is that Chelsted was killed and for a period of time there was no Hand until the Trident, when Aerys appointed Rossart. Presumably this was part and parcel of Aerys's conflict with his son, that he refused to name him (perhaps he dangled it in front of him if he won against Robert) or anyone else, and only chose a Hand when Rhaegar was dead.""

&gt;  
&gt;No, Rhaegar is not an analogue to anyone from history.  
&gt;  
&gt;*When we are first introduced to Jaqen H’ghar we find him in confinement. His storyline obviously takes several turns. Will we ever discover why he was in the dungeon? Have you already laid out the clues and I just haven’t pieced them together yet? Or will the origins of him being in King’s Landing remain a mystery?*

We got her little pet."" He reached back and shoved the burden off, and it fell with a thump in front of Ned.
Bending, Ned pulled back the cloak, dreading the words he would have to find for Arya, but it was not Nymeria after all. It was the butcher's boy, Mycah, his body covered in dried blood. He had been cut almost in half from shoulder to waist by some terrible blow struck from above.

167,"Having Tyrion smirk instead of getting shocked when Dany starts to burn Kings Landing. This would indicate he plotted the fall of Kings Landing long before that moment because he despised the people of Kings Landing after his trial. He purposely gave Dany bad advice to drive her mad and then made Jon kill her. After this, he got himself a puppet king that doesn't care about ruling the country so he can rule it himself. He literally became the new Tywin. Tywin was also the decision-maker behind the puppet king Joffrey.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw a post about Tyrion actually being a villain in the story in this sub and I thought maybe Tyrion giving Dany such bad advice is not about him being incompetent but him plotting against her. Can this be a direction that Tyrion's character can take in the books? Because he is obviously whitewashed in the show compared to his book version.",asoiaf
168,"In order to guess how the Dornish wars might take place in the upcoming Dance of Dragons between fAegon and Dany, we might consider some conflicts where Dorne faced dragons.

**Round 1**

&gt;“When the Young Dragon conquered Dorne, he used a **goat track** to bypass the Dornish watchtowers on the Boneway.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“I know that tale as well, but Daeron made too much of it in that vainglorious book of his. Ships won that war, not goat tracks. Oakenfist broke the Planky Town and swept halfway up the **Greenblood** whilst the main Dornish strength was engaged in the **Prince’s Pass**.”

While the main Dornish strength was engaged in the Dornish Passes, Oakenfist attacked Planky Town and swept up the Greenblood, which was one of the main reasons of the victory. But the goat tracks are also important because Robb defeated the army of Stafford by the goat track Grey Wind had found and Stannis himself took Deepwood Motte by following mostly the goat tracks.

The idea here is clear.

1. Traditionally, the Dornish use their own terrain to their advantage but an unaccounted path like the goat track of the Young Dragon might undo their strategy.
2. Dorne never had a naval power since Nymeria burned her ships. This was a mistake. Greenblood is the life blood of Dorne and Dorne is very vulnerable to an attack to Planky Town. Of course the mouth of the river is not completely undefended but a strong fleet with an able captain can crush them and open the way to the heart of Dorne.

Dragons win.

**Round 2**

&gt;“*\[Trystane\]* always sets his squares up the same way, with all the mountains in the front and his **elephants in the passes**,” said Myrcella. “So I send my dragon through to eat his elephants.”

Trystane plays cyvasse according to traditional Dornish tactics. He deploys his main strength in the passes and relies on impassable mountains and the terrain. However, a dragon can fly over the mountains and this is how Trystane is defeated every time.

Their cyvasse game is a representation of the Young Dragon and Dornish forces in the passes. Myrcella’s dragon flies over the mountains to slay the elephants of Trystane. By using the goat tracks, the Young Dragon “flew over” the mountains and caught the Dornish unawares.

Dragons win.

**Round 3**

&gt;Quentyn heard the sellswords shouting. Caggo was calling for the chains, and Pretty Meris was screaming at someone to step aside. The dragon moved awkwardly on the ground, like a man scrabbling on his knees and elbows, but quicker than the Dornish prince would have believed. When the Windblown were too late to get out of his way, Viserion let loose with another roar. Quentyn heard the rattle of chains, the deep *thrum* of a crossbow.  
&gt;  
&gt;“No,” he screamed, “no, don’t, *don’t*,” but it was too late. *The fool* was all that he had time to think as the quarrel caromed off Viserion’s neck to vanish in the gloom. A line of fire gleamed in its wake—dragon’s blood, glowing gold and red.  
&gt;  
&gt;Quentyn turned and threw his left arm across his face to shield his eyes from the furnace wind. *Rhaegal*, he reminded himself, *the green one is Rhaegal*.  
&gt;  
&gt;When he raised his whip, he saw that the lash was burning. His hand as well. All of him, all of him was burning.

This is a full representation of the conquest of Dorne. Prince Quentyn was engaged with Viserion and he was standing at the only way in or out. This is *literally* the Prince’s Pass. However, Quentyn could not notice Rhaegal creeping behind and burning him. This is similar to how the Young Dragon used the goat tracks and caught the Dornish unawares.

Dragons win.

**Round 4**

Trystane loses the cyvasse game to a clever Lannister to whom he is betrothed. It is foreshadowed that Viserion will be Tyrion’s mount but he will lose it at one point, after which he might claim Rhaegal. Quentyn was intending to steal Viserion, which will be the mount of another clever Lannister (Tyrion) but he was slain by Rhaegal. With the green dragon, Tyrion will fly through the Red Mountains to find the goat tracks. While Dany’s main naval force attacks Planky Town, her other armies will invade Dorne by these goat tracks. Note that the elephants of Trystane are eaten by Myrcella’s dragon flying over the mountains. The elephants allude to the Golden Company and Tyrion will be one of the instrumental pieces in defeating them.

Dragons will win this round and the Dornish will pay the price of Arianne’s royal ambitions.",asoiaf
169,"I have decided to mix things up for my current ASOIAF re-read and go for a combined reading order of AFFC/ADWD. After doing some research about Boiled Leather, I decided to use A Ball of Beasts which does the same things as Boiled Leather only, I found, more elegantly.

However, there is one more reading order which gets mentioned a lot, A Feast with Dragons, and I found surprisingly little information about it. Which is a shame because I really enjoy the art that combining Books 4 and 5 is and this reading order does many interesting things, from the way it opens, the spacing of Davos and Daenerys to the ending and probably many more things I didn't notice.

So if you guys here have any links to some information I missed or any interesting insights about AFWD or any other reading order which might perhaps change my mind from going with ABOB, I would be very glad for them.",asoiaf
170,"Based on “the slayer of lies” prophecy and “the blue eyed king with no shadow” vision from HotU sequence, many readers have long predicted a confrontation between Dany and Stannis. One of the oldest theories for this confrontation came not long after ADwD was published. According to that theory, Stannis will eventually win the Manderlys to his cause. When Dany comes to Westeros, Stannis will use the newly introduced Manderly fleet against Dany and this naval battle will end with Dany’s victory, hence fulfilling the HotU vision.

Another theory that was fed into this scheme was that Tyrion will be the rider of Viserion and in this naval battle against Stannis, Davos will fire a bolt that will slay Viserion. I don’t want to get into the discussion about why Tyrion will be Viserion’s rider but the death of Viserion was guessed by the following quotes:

&gt;“Well, how *long* does a dragon live?” She looked up as Viserion swooped low over the ship, his wings beating slowly and stirring the limp sails.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt; He moved the catapult again, closed his hand around Tyrion's alabaster dragon, removed it from the board. 

When Dany asks the life expectancy of dragons, GRRM drops Viserion to the scene as he flies low over the ship. This means Viserion might be the first dragon to die. Also noting the ship and sails detail from the quote and recalling that the sigil of Davos has a ship in it with an onion on its sails, it might suggest that Davos will be the one to slay Viserion. This might happen in the above mentioned naval battle between Dany and Stannis and it will also be the second round of Davos vs. Tyrion. At the Blackwater, Davos lost his sons to Tyrion’s wildfire. In the second round, Davos might take down Tyrion’s mount as payback.

Note that this was a very early theory when even [Davos the Dragonslayer](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Davos_the_Dragonslayer) was not created by GRRM yet, nor did we have the excerpts from the Dance of Dragons. At that time, it was like blasphemy to suggest the death of any dragons. But after GRRM revealed how dragons were slain like flies during the Dance of Dragons, how he also revealed a legendary hero named Davos the Dragonslayer in TWOIAF and how Viserion was slain in the show, I became even more convinced on this theory and I included in all versions of my outline.

This sums up the naval battle between Dany and Stannis, the dragonslaying moment of Davos and Dany’s victory at the expense of Viserion. My addition to this theory when I incorporated it into my outline was that after the victory, Dany will be furious for the loss of Viserion and she will want to send a message to Westeros to let them see what happens if they fight against Dany. She will fly Drogon to White Harbor after the victory and burn down parts of the city as punishment until she cools off. This idea of mine about Dany burning White Harbor after the death of Viserion was brutally rejected like the rest of my outlines.

More than 2 years passed and we watched Dany firebombing King’s Landing after the battle is won and massacring innocents. Since then, people hated this idea of Dany indiscriminately massacring innocents after the battle is over, called it bad writing and proposed many changes to “improve” the scenario. One of the widely proposed ideas was to make sure that Rhaegal is slain by the defenders at the capitol and that should have made Dany snap and burn innocents. Well, you can imagine my reaction to /r/asoiaf clinging on to an idea of a “Dany-hater” like me and thinking that it makes sense.

Finally, I want to share some objections to Dany burning White Harbor for the death of Viserion by my good friend  [**u/YezenIRL**](https://www.reddit.com/user/YezenIRL/) as we discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/7678of/spoilers_extended_twow_outline_with_chapter/dofmquc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).",asoiaf

173,"A couple of months ago u/glass_table_girl posted a marvelous essay called “Daughter of Death: A Song of Ice and Fire’s Shakespearean tragic hero” I highly recommend people check it out. It got me wondering about the Daenerys, Jon and Tyrion’s fates as Shakespearean figures, considering how the show ended. I personally can’t picture Daenerys burning KL in the way the show did it, mercilessly targeting small folk AFTER the city surrendered. This seems like the show choosing the most shocking and objectively evil way possible, so as to get the audience fully onboard with Jon killing her. I think it more likely that Daenerys decides to attack (f)Aegon and KL with Dragonfire and unwittingly detonates the wildfire caches. As Steven Attewell has said this would make her “still morally culpable but not objectively monstrous”. Other POV characters (not knowing wildfire was involved) could then conclude that Daenerys had been entirely responsible and burned the city, totally on her own. Her own fateful choice to give in to her darkest impulses and attack (f)Aegon with her Dragons will have then cemented everyone’s worst fears about her. 

I can see Tyrion, being blamed by Daenerys for not revealing to her the truth about the Wildfire, and being imprisoned. When Jon meets with him, Tyrion, who has already become jealous of Jon for earning Daenerys’ affections, and wanting revenge on the both of them, plays the role of Iago to Jon’s Othello in a way. Rather than persuading Jon that Daenerys is cheating on him, Tyrion convinces him that Daenerys represents a mortal threat to his family, as he does in the show, but unlike the show, does so in an intentionally deceitful manner. We know from ADWD, that if Jon is convinced that Arya is in danger he will not scruple to break an oath. George originally intended Tyrion and Jon to be involved in a fateful love triangle with Arya, perhaps now he’s substituted Dany for Arya as the object of their (hopeless in Tyrion’s case) affections. Daenerys burning KL will have cemented the possibility in Jon’s mind that she really could be a threat to his family. 

I think Jon and Daenerys would have become estranged prior to this point anyway. I don’t think it will be Jon’s discomfort with incest ( remember he was originally supposed to have a thing for his sister/cousin) that causes it but rather Daenerys’ mistrust of him upon learning his identity. Which Tyrion will also exploit, as he does in the show. As the “Daughter of Death” essay outlines, this can be yet another fateful choice that Daenerys has made. Choosing to distance herself from Jon, of rejecting the love and companionship that was her hearts desire, because of her fear of betrayal. She could think “how long did he know?” “Was he lying to me the entire time?” “Did I kill my brothers son, thinking him false and fall in love with an imposter?” This would also add a level of moral complexity and “grayness” to Jon’s decision. He’s got his own reasons to feel hurt and wronged by Daenerys, which may be driving his choices. I can’t picture George writing a scene where a man murders a woman who he’s intimate with and playing it as “you should feel sorry for the man, he clearly had no choice.” Especially since he already did this with Victarion and doesn’t seem to think it’s that admirable (because it isn’t). We should understand Jon’s motivation but the morality of his decision will be much more gray in George’s version. 

Tyrion’s ultimate fate will echo Iago’s in a way. “Demand me nothing. What you know, you know./From this time forth I never will speak word.” Like Iago, he survives the story but is no longer trusted to give poisonous counsel to others. Unlike Iago though, Tyrion is LITERALLY silenced, and made into a mute. There’s been plenty of theorizing in the fan community about Tyrion losing his tongue or ability to speak. I think there’s been plenty of foreshadowing for this as well. I know this proposed version basically leaves Tyrion as a villain (albeit a sympathetic one IMO) which people won’t like. The show clearly decided to cast Tyrion as a saintly figure, which weakened him as a character tremendously. I think this fits George’s story better than what we got in the show. The only real problem I can see with the Tyrion as Iago concept, as it relates to Jon, is that he has already played this role for Jaime. “She’s been fucking Lancel, and Osmund Kettleblack and Moonboy for all I know.” 

What do you think? I’m not a Shakespeare scholar so please have mercy in your criticisms on that score.

The moment that takes my breath away is when she reinstates the faith militant. She thinks she’s so brilliant, says “Even Tywin could have done no better”, when she arms an entirely new faction that clearly isn’t supportive of her, all for an unimportant blessing of Tommen and the relaxing of debts she already wasn’t paying. It’s just astounding.

177,"People compare Dany to her father Aerys but in my view she is more like Maegor the cruel. A strong character riding the biggest black dragon (Balerion and Drogon) who are loved by the smallfolk at first because they admire their strength and quick decision making to serve justice. Both of them are lived in exile until they became able to steal the throne foe themselves. With every decision they take and executions they perform, they believed they vanquished the evil until their killing tendencies crossed the limit to finally make them the evil. Both of them died at the throne room killed by their loved ones (Maegor's death is still mysterious but I think his wife killed him and joined the faith as a penance).",asoiaf

Makes no sense, since they are introduced in the prologue of *AGoT* and the cold opening of the series premiere, showing that this is the real important plot, not the political scheming. My question is, do you think the books will go down the same route of having the Others defeated at Winterfell? Or do you think they'll make it further down south, leading to more of Westeros uniting together? I think that'll likely happen, here's hoping.",asoiaf
179,"Hi, everyone! I just started A Game of Thrones and I am halfway through the first book. I've never watched the show, but I have wanted to really get into the show because I like the book so much. Should I wait until I am finished with the books to start on the show, or should I go ahead and start the show now? Also, how similar are the books and the show?",asoiaf
180,"Might be denial and delusions, but I'd be willing to bet we're gonna see a very different ending on the books. We won't only get different HOWs but a different WHAT. I started thinking about it since 8x04 confirmed the WW threat was completely gone, then GRRM wrote in his blog: **""The same ending as the show?  Different? Well… yes.  And no.  And yes.   And no.   And yes.   And no.   And yes.""**

So is it different? first answer is yes, then he's basically saying some things might be similar, but not really, but some things do happen, but different. So if you ask me, yeah, it's gonna be completely different.


**How do we even know D&amp;D chose to use GRRM's ending?** Think about it, would they change so much of the characters and plots, **stop working with George and continuously defy the books just to go and use the intended ending for the story? I think not**, I hope not. I honestly believe the show's ending (Mad Queen Dany and King Bran the Broken), just like the NK's death by Arya, are all D&amp;D.


They even get angry if an actor tries to reason with them, using the books, so they don't kill an important character. Other actors have said D&amp;D treat GoT as if it was their own, they told Nikolaj to shut up, stop arguing and just say his lines. Do you think people who get angry when presented with solid reasoning would just accept another person's views on how GoT should end? Sadly, they wouldn't even accept the author's opinon.


After reading the post [GRRM's real thoughts on the TV show, as written in FIRE AND BLOOD](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/c7keit/spoilers_extended_grrms_real_thoughts_on_the_tv/) I'm even more confident D&amp;D made their own ending. GRRM writes: **""As alteration followed alteration over the years, it became ever more difficult to ascertain which was the original text""**. People are forgetting his books are the original text, not the show, people are taking for granted what happens on the show will or did happen on the books, when that's not the case since season 5. Sure, we'd have to assume a bunch of stuff, but come on, we know GRRM wouldn't make Dany burn Kings Landing for no reason at all or make Jon completely useless against the Others and making the NK die from a random valyrian steel dagger.


Such a complex story, full of interesting characters, realistic medieval consequences for their actions, actual development and growth. I don't think it will just end with Dany being Mad Queen like her father or Jaime and Cersei dying the way they did or Jon not wanting the throne or not getting killed for murdering Dany or Bran being the king with one of the worst possible Small Councils. Doesn't matter if the way we get there changes, I honestly don't think that's the ending ASOIAF deserves. That's my opinion, but maybe a well written journey can take us to that ending and make us feel satisfied, maybe GRRM just isn't great at writing endings and it'll suck.

I guess we'll just have to wait and see. What do you guys think? How different will the last 2 books be to the last seasons of the show?",asoiaf
181,"So, it's explained that after Jon Arryn called his banners and rebelled against King Aerys, Robert went to the Stormlands, and Ned went to the North respectively to call their banners and get reinforcements. I'm wondering what the North's opinion of Ned was at the time, since Ned was apparently unlike Brandon in most ways; Brandon was hot-blooded and eager to fight, and Ned was The Quiet Wolf and was fostered in the Vale.

Did Ned's upbringing help or hinder his efforts to call the banners, or were any misgivings about Eddard 'All about that Honor"" Stark overshadowed by unyielding rage since Rickard, Brandon, and Brandon's host were murdered in horrible ways and that the people of the North hold one Hell of a grudge?",asoiaf

With all the discussion about King Bran going on at the moment, comparisons of Bran's story to the Fisher King and the Bran the Blessed myths seem to keep popping up. Personally, I'm not very knowledgeable about these mythologies and have only done a little bit of Wikipedia research, so I would love to know what you guys think:

How far do the parallels between Bran and these mythological characters go? What does that mean for the other characters in our story (as the myth features for example Bran's sister and half-brother)? What are the implications for the endgame?

184,"In lamenting some of the terribleness of modern screenwriting, Blake Snyder points out how many films lack a simple ""Save the cat!"" scene which he defines as such:

&gt;It's the scene where we meet the hero and the hero *does* something -- like saving a cat -- that defines who he is and makes us, the audience, like him.

Before continuing, there's a few caveats to stave off some knee-jerk criticisms of this description (it's overly simple). It doesn't need to be the ""hero,"" just whoever the story wants us to invest in. It doesn't have to be something cliche and saccharine like literally saving a cat. And, we don't actually need to ""like"" the character; don't need to identity with or relate to them. What we need to do is care about what he does and what happens to him.

All that said, one part of the save the cat description that is a hard and fast rule is that the character must *do* something. The italics are Snyder's original, and it's just an immutable law of story telling that active characters are more engaging than passive ones. When something horrible happens to a character *we're already invested in*, we care. We don't care when a character is introduced as a victim, having something horrible happening to them.

In the series Stranger Things, this is the ""he could have cast protection, but instead he cast fireball"" moment when Mike, Lucas, and Dustin decide to defy their curfews, and put themselves in danger (either with their parents, or something worse) in order to go looking for their missing friend.

Doesn't have to be something heroic though. It could simply be a character doing something clever. In Arrival, it's the ""desire for more cows"" moment. It's the opening monologue of Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Or it could be something horrible. It's *killing* the dog in House of Cards (boy do we already hate you, Frank Underwood, but we're also already invested in your story).

**Everywhere They Hurt Little Cats**

So where does this leave us with A Game of Thrones?

Ned certainly doesn't save any cats... though they do save some direwolf pups. But actually, Ned's save the cat scene is executing Gared. I hate the ""subverting expectations"" crutch as much as the next guy (unless the next guy is a popcorn-stuffer who loves subverted expectations), but the save the cat moment for Ned is him killing a deserter who the audience knows had damn good reason to run as far and as fast from the Wall as he could. It works though because we're able to understand Ned's point of view and are impressed with his ""the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword"" attitude and the vulnerability he shows when telling Bran that the only time a man can be brave is when he's scared. Maybe we think Gared deserved a chance to return to Castle Black (maybe not), but either way Ned has done a thing that expresses his character and makes us care about what happens to him.

**But What About All The Other Cats That Need Saving?**

What complicates the hell out of this mechanic is that ASOIAF has so many damn characters in the driver's seat. We're expected to get invested in a lot of people in this series -- that's a lot of cats that need saving. I obviously can't get into all of them, but I've just picked out three more that I think are particularly interesting.

**Tyrion** -- If you're thinking it's the ""bastards, cripples, and broken things"" moment when Tyrion returns to Winterfell after visiting the Wall, you're too late. If you think it's Tyrion being the first to tell Jon the truth about the Night's Watch on their way to the Wall, you're again too late. I believe Tyrion's first save the cat moment is when he bitch slaps Prince Joffrey. We've already been introduced to Tyrion in Jon's first chapter, and he's probably gotten our interest with the ""all dwarves are bastards in the eyes of their fathers"" quip. But, it's when Tyrion, the stunted man with feeble twisted legs, slaps the crown prince right in front of The Hound that he really gets his moment of showing his character -- like his brother the Kingslayer, the Imp strives to be someone better than what the world believes him to be.

**Sansa** -- I think this one is rather complicated. If I said I cared what happened to Sansa in AGOT, it's only to the extent that I really care about what happens to Joffrey. Truth be told, Sansa is something of an antagonist in the first book. When we start to get more invested in her is in A Clash of Kings. Early on, we get the pathetic excuse of a tournament for Joffrey's name day celebration where Sansa does an almost literal saving a cat by saving Ser Dontos. This is the moment where we see the Sansa we'll come to appreciate, someone who is not only less of a brat (because of the trauma she suffered in AGOT) but also becoming a savvy manipulator. This isn't the the Sansa who got upset that Ned bought her a doll or who betrayed her sister to save her relationship with Joffrey, but the Sansa who says she ""prays for an end to the fighting"" without saying how she prays it ends. That's the Sansa we get invested in.

**Danaerys** -- This is probably the trickiest of the characters. If she had been successfully assassinated by the wine merchant, I think my reaction would have been ""oh shit... what does this mean for Ned?"" I had a hard time getting invested in her character, and I believe this is because for much of her story things are happening *to* her. It's true that along the way in AGOT she gains more and more autonomy. Perhaps her save the cat moment is when she orders the Dothraki to stop raping the Lahrazeen women. This is going to be highly subjective, of course. What makes one reader invested doesn't necessarily click for another. A second potential moment for investment in her is of course Khal Drogo's funeral, the burning of MMD, and the birth of her dragons -- for me though she's only semi-active there, having an idea of what she's doing, but not fully aware. For me, it feels like she's in a bit of a haze, and not yet come into her own.

The moment where Danaerys saved the cat for me was her decision to leave Vaes Tolorro. She has traveled long and hard through the Red Wastes and finally found a place of relative safety. The region has water, fruit trees, and arable land. She could remain there, perhaps her small khalasar would grow a little, and more importantly her dragons could mature in safety. With the lamb women, I don't believe she really understood what she was doing in saving them. With the funeral pyre, she's acting half out of grief. But, in leaving Vaes Tolorro, she is in a position of relative safety, and most importantly -- she is able to exercise complete agency.

tl;dr: If an author wants someone to get invested in their characters, they need to do something to earn the audience's investment. We're not just drawn to people because someone tells us we're supposed to be.

They really reduced Ghost's role on the show and that I think it was mistake and a damnshame, especially because of his relationship with Jon and the fact that he's a warg just like Bran. But in the show Jon was separated from Ghost for a season and a half. Not that it damaged their relationship since Direwolves are loyal and loving but it's very nice to see that in the books they are always together, even after Jon *joined* the Wildlings.


Jon still had his major talk with Sam in AGOT but it was again changed while adding other aspects on the tv show, as well his farewell from Ned that was show exclusive, and what was the reason why he *joined* the Wildlings that was about to be revealed to Mance Rayder.


Speaking of Mance, he also has a more active and interesting role, same with Qhorin Halfhand. When Mance revealed that he infiltrated at Winterfell to see Robert I was as shocked as Jon. And Ygritte's traits seem to be a bit different so far, bummer they cut off the part about the song on the show.

187,"I am not referring to the tv show. In the show she is very clearly a tomboy. Someone who is more like an Ayra all grown up but without quite as much privilege. However, her characterization in the books is markedly different. I am only nearing the end of Storm but the behavior of Brienne deviates so dramatically from the other female characters on the show. Unlike Ayra she deeply resents the idea of being referred to as a woman. Which to note is a significant difference than disliking being treated as a girl. One denotes a rejection of sexism, the other an incongruence with your sense of self. Even in the short time that I have been reading this it has been strongly eluded to that Brienne does not view herself as a woman. With Jamie even questioning her as to whether she would prefer to be a guy (a question he doesn't let her answer and immediately berates her for such an idea). If this is George's intent for the character I am not surprised that it was omitted from the show (a part of the audience likely would have lost their shit). But her levels of borderline violent reaction at being called ""wench"", ""my Lady"", and the like make her stick out from any other female character in the show. As someone who is somewhat of a Tomboy myself, she just doesn't strike me as one. She strikes me as transgender instead. However, I will preface this by saying that I have not gotten to Brienne's internal monologue chapters which begin in Feast for Crows. Maybe that will reveal an entirely different internal monologue but at the moment this is what it seems like to me. For Brienne to come out after a fashion in later seasons.

At the start of the chapter Davos arrives at White Harbor on the ship Merry Midwife.  The reader is given a detailed description of this cog, down to her figurehead – a laughing woman holding an infant by one foot.  I thought it was a really unique image for a ship’s figurehead.  It hit me that what this figurehead was depicting was the Greek myth of baby Achilles being dipped into the river Styx by his mother.  She held him by the heel as she dipped baby Achilles in the water.  But why make such an unmistakable reference to Achilles?  I began to pull that thread…

In Greek mythology, Achilles spent his childhood in hiding on the isle of Skyros.  Odysseus goes to find Achilles in order to successfully capture Troy.  He goes to Skyros and manages to get Achilles to reveal himself.  

This all sounds so much like what Davos is about to do at the end of his story in DwD.  Davos is so much like Odysseus it’s funny I didn’t think about it years before.  He spends years serving his king while the whole time pining for home and his wife (think Odysseus in the Odyssey wanting nothing but to complete his tasks in order to return home to his wife).  Davos is sailing around islands, being bombarded by storms, and finding himself at the mercy of various lords.  Again, this sounds so much like Odysseus in the Odyssey.  Then there is, of course, the mission to find Rickon.  The isle of SKAGOS sound an awful like the isle of SKYROS.  Davos is sent to find a boy in hiding as Odysseus was sent to find a boy in hiding.  

The flavor of this Greek story is all over Davos in DwD.  I can only guess how it will play out in TWoW but I’m now confident that looking towards stories of the Iliad and the Odyssey may provide predictive hints.

196,"And the lack of consistency sickers into every aspect of the show. This will be a long post, but I need to get this off my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

Forget realism for a second. Dragons, magic and zombies don't exist. It's fantasy. But you can establish a universe where such things do exists. It's not realistic by a long shot, but we can suspend our disbelief. After all, the rest of the world still follows pretty realistic rules regarding genetics, physics, politics etc. These are still humans, navigating an otherwise earth-like world. So we have elements of fantasy that are grounded in an otherwise realistic setting.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason we can suspend our disbelief for the fantasy elements in the first place is consistency. That's the key to establish a congruent universe and it gets misunderstood so much that it almost seems malevolent at times, especially thinking back to the Last Jedi fiasco, where, unlike this (much worse) dumpster fire, the mainstream media was against us ""haters"".

The key to a congruent fictional universe is a more or less strict set of rules that you have to follow. Those rules, like magic for example, don't have to be realistic, but once set up, you've set a precedent that the audience accepts as a natural law. If you break such a rule, you better have a damn good explanation for it. That's why you can't do a hyperspace kamikaze run. It breaks the established rules so much that you have to wonder why that hasn't been a tactic in the thousands of years since hyperspace was invented.

And especially in TV and cinema, you don't have to follow just your own rules, you also have to follow Hollywood rules, just because we are so popular. Guns and sword sound for example are very different in the real world, but the audience expects something they know, or it won't feel real to them.

For the same exact reason, we still use insanely loud vacuums and car doors. We have the technology to make them way more silent, but customers would feel like they won't work properly. Mercedes once built a very expensive car model with very quiet doors - and after many customer complaints that the doors weren't shutting properly, they recalled them and installed *speakers* that played a door shutting sound to it would feel satisfying.

&amp;#x200B;

But you can still do crazy shit. In fact, in-universe restrictions are not restrictions on creativity. The opposite is the case, restrictions *foster* creativity - if you're not a lazy hack, that is. Faced with a problem, you have to come up with a congruent way to solve that, without introducing a plot device, be it magic, a McGuffin, techno babble or a deus ex machina.

&amp;#x200B;

That's where ASOIAF succeeded and the show fails massively. One thing GRRM did extraordinarily well was setting up a world that's grounded in realism. Characters, even main characters, are no superheroes like classic fantasy protagonists. They too face the same consequences that red shirts do. How did he do that? Most prominently by killing off the main character of the first book. And it wasn't for shock value, it was to demonstrate that this is *not* a fairy tale! Even main characters face the consequences of their actions. Being honorable, careless or romantic can easily get you killed if you face more ruthless opponents.

Sure it was a shock. It did subvert our expectations. But in hindsight, we (and probably Ned) should have seen it coming. We were able to reflect, re-read and re-watch to conclude that Ned's strategy wasn't the best. It was unexpected, but it made sense, given the ruthless and gritty world we are shown. That creates a lot of tension and that's why we kept watching, not because we were lusting for the spectacle of another protagonist's death.

&amp;#x200B;

A more direct comparison is the smallfolk of King's Landing. Early on we see them in open revolt when they are starving under King Joffrey. We also see how the great noble houses react if you imprison, attempt to or are falsely accused of assassinating a family member. And a few seasons later, that same society is completely idle when a usurper queen blows up the Westeros equivalent of the Vatican along with very prominent and popular aristocracy? Actually we can only assume idleness, since we never actually see any of the political consequences because everybody just fucks off back home.

&amp;#x200B;

Something even more obvious is distance. The early seasons did a very good job of conveying the passage of time, especially during travel. Some characters were just busy riding from A to B off screen for a few episodes. For others, stuff happened during their travel, most notably Tyrion during the way to the Eyrie and back home. Gendry just rowed a boat for who knows how long. Hell, we missed most of the battles of the War of the Five Kings, but we still got mostly filled in in the form of ravens, strategy meetings and more personal dialogue, like Robb and Edmure regarding the Mountain and a mill.

There are precedents, not only how big and vast the continent is, but also, on a more meta level, how you can convey that distance to the reader/viewer, even if it was for budget reasons at first.

That's why people feel that the last few seasons were rushed. During the stupid Capture-The-Wight sidequest, Gendry, only trained in long-distance rowing, sprints from the True North to the Wall, sends a Raven to Dragonstone and has Dany fling back to the Far North without GPS assistance in what seems to be a single night, when previously, just the way to the Wall would have taken several weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

Armor is similarly treated. I can generally forgive the lack of helmets: Really useful, but for cinematographic reasons, you would want the audience to see and recognize their protagonists - although there are methods to convey that a bit more realistically, at least for royalty. Bobby B for example was famous for his antler helmet and his warhammer.

And yes, armor is generally very poorly treated in fantasy. But in season 1, we see Jorah demonstrating how useful plate armor is by catching an Arakh in it and instantly winning the fight. In Season 4, Bronn explains why a mobile and nimble fighter/a rogue  would take a great risk facing the Mountain/a tank and after Oberyn exploits weaknesses in the Mountain's armor, Bronn's prediction comes true: One mistake and you're dead.

Then we see the same character, Jorah, getting stabbed through his plate armor by a rusty dagger, Theon getting stabbed through plate by the **wooden end** of a spear and the Hound impales the Mountain through plate and chain armor and it *goes all the way through!*

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest thread for consistency in a character driven show are of course the characters. And of course, characters can change. We see that in Jamie before somebody accidentally pushed his reset-button (Finger in the bum maybe?).

In seasons 1-4 the story was primarily driven by characters reacting to their environment. After that, especially starting with season 6, we just saw them going from A to B, checking off plot points. That's why Tyrion is suddenly a moron. That's why we diverted from ""show, not tell"", and Sansa is suddenly the smartest person alive cause Arya told us so.

But hell, even in season 7, there's still a bit of good left. Watch Dany's and Jon's first encounter and watch their wills clash because they are equally stubborn. Yeah, Jon's socially awkward, but watch Dany develop an interest in Jon because he has no time for this childish squabbeling and stands up to her without bending the knee. Aaaand then he gets reduced to  a complete sock puppet without any free will.

Or Dany, getting suddenly depressed because nobody loves her because Tormund suddenly forgot he rode a dragon too because the plot demanded it - when she knows exactly how to charm the smallfolk into a great stagedive. And that woman who was always concerned with the smallfolk and has seemingly learned to cope with losses, tragedy, cruelty and hardship, that women, in the face of the surrender of her arch enemy, now burns **everything but** her arch enemy?

And I'm supposed to buy that? Yeah, she has shown impatience, overreactions and cruelty - towards the people in power, not towards women and children! Have another season to render her more paranoid and burn a few nobles for it, then I'd buy it, but this ain't Dany. Gods, even Dany haters hate her heel turn!

&amp;#x200B;

And I feel like the impersonation of all these flaws is Euron fucking Greyjoy. He is hellbent on putting a prince into Cersei's belly, then doesn't even flinch when Tyrion mentions her pregnancy during the Parlay. His aim and his scorpions are always just as good or bad as the plots needs them to be. He seems to have a radar (which would be fine if he was more like the books). He swims miles in minutes for a fanservice showdown we didn't even want because those two didn't have any history (even Jamie was like ""What!?""). He boasts about being the killer of Jamie, despite not killing him at all, despite Jamie losing his legendary fighter status a few seasons ago and despite Euron killing A FUCKING DRAGON a week ago with a triple 360 noscope MLG shot!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To close it off: This is why I think it's worse than Disney Star Wars:

There's the sheer number of assassinated characters. Disney only sucessfully ruined the OT characters, a spaceship (which I didn't think was possible) and then TLJ came along and ruined the new characters as well! But you can still watch the original trilogy in isolation and get a complete, consistent and coherent story. Maybe even add the prequels, the only major thing you have to headcanon out are the midichlorians.

But Game Of Thrones... it's one continuity, there's no part you can leave out to get something complete. Maybe watch 1-6 and watch Dorne as a buddy comedy to end with a cliffhanger. I would recommend watching 1-4, then read all the books, but let's be honest here: We will never get the books either.",asoiaf
197,"Excerpt from TWOW Arrianne


It was then that pasty, pudgy Teora raised her eyes from the creamcakes on her plate. ""It is dragons.""
""Dragons?"" said her mother. ""Teora, don't be mad.""
""I'm not. They're coming.""
""How could you possibly know that?"" her sister asked, with a note of scorn in her voice.
""One of your little dreams?""
Teora gave a tiny nod, chin trembling. ""They were dancing. In my dream. And everywhere the dragons danced the people died.""

198,"Finished ADWD recently. Had a lightbulb moment yesterday.

Elia Martell was in love with Arthur Dayne (It's his name she cried when the Lannister men came for her) and cheating. Ashara discovers it. Probably, after the tourney at Harrenhal (though not that it was with her brother, at this point.) As one of Elia's maids-in-waiting, Ashara would've known best how Elia felt about her husband's slight in crowning Lyanna. Which she might've found a bit indifferent for a loving, loyal wife. Which makes her curious and more observant of her mistress' behaviour and activities leading to the discovery.

Ashara, we know, was 'dishonoured' by someone at Harrenhal. My take is she slept with Robert Baratheon. He refuses to marry her, of course. Because he's betrothed to Lyanna, she thinks. She can do nothing but be okay with it. And is. Until she discovers she's pregnant. Days before Robert's wedding to Lyanna. Maybe, he'll marry her if Lyanna is out of the picture. Which she might be if there was an honourable way for Rhaegar to pursue Lyanna. By means of an annulment if he knew his wife to be cheating and the children not his. So Ashara informs Rhaegar of Elia's doings and we know the rest. At some point after this, she learns that the other party is her brother. She kills herself as the mess she instigated ends up killing her brother.

So, young Griff, fair-haired (like Edric Dayne) and purple-eyed(like Ashara Dayne) is Arthur Dayne's son.

This also explains why Rhaegar names Jon Aegon (as we discover in the show) when he already has a son called Aegon who he believes is TPTWP.

No wonder Arthur Dayne is perpetually sad.

Varys, of course, knew all this",asoiaf
199,"First thing I have to say is that I have been watching this show for a long time. I picked up the books shortly after the season 2 ended, and I read through all of them. Even in seasons 3 or 4, which are generally regarded as the golden age of the show, I noticed my favourite characters drift away from their book counterparts. 

However I **do not** consider this in itself to be a problem. After all, the show is different, and there is nothing bad about minor or even major changes, as long as you make a sense of it in the end. 


When you derive from the story of characters book counterpart, while still wanting both of them to end up at the same place, that’s where the issues start. I’ve decided to create this “masterpost,” about where I think the show went wrong with each main character (Sansa, Petyr, Arya, Jon, Tyrion, Jaime, Cersei, Daenerys and Bran) and why it became such a spectacular failure. 


Let’s begin with one of my favourite characters, Sansa, since she is the most perfect example.



#**Sansa Stark**

When Sansa arrived to the Vale with Petyr, she is finally free from Joffrey’s tyrrany. She is free to grow, and to become her own person. In the books, she learns that it was Petyr who started the war with his actions. She sees the whole truth, and decides to stay with him anyway. What other choice does she have? She takes her first step to become a competent player in the game of thrones when she lies about her aunt’s death, and from then forward, she learns. We can only assume that she will become a cunning and capable person, who outwits Littlefinger in the end, and takes power into her own hands. 


And what happened in the show? When she escaped King’s Landing, where she was used and abused, waiting for someone to save her, they decided to merge her story with Jayne Poole, and marry her to Ramsay. There, she once again, is used and abused, waiting for someone to save her. Throwing a character into the same situation over and over again is not a way to make them grow. When she finally escapes, suddenly she is a cunning and calculating individual. Where did that come from? Honestly as much as I don’t like seeing all the Sansa hate, I don’t really blame you all. She suddenly emerged a genius manipulator without ever doing anything that would indicate her new set fo skills. When she outsmarted Petyr, it was not her wit, it was Bran telling her what he has done. Was that supposed to be Sansa’s victory? That brings me to...



#**Petyr Baelish**

The moment Bran quoted his own words back to him, Petyr would’ve fled Winterfell immediately. That’s all there is to this point. His whole character arc from seasons 4 to 7 is him getting dumber and dumber so Sansa can seem smarter in comparison. This is not a development, this is laziness. His whole plot of pitting Arya and Sansa against each other was just stupid. Speaking of...



#**Arya Stark**

Arya Stark was a a deeply traumatised individual suffering from PTSD who chose to kill the people who have wronged her as an unhealthy coping mechanism. Her character let us see the horrors of war and the world they live in. She is a very morally grey character, or at least that was, untill the show started glorifying her actions. 


Suddenly, all the mental consequences of mercilessly killing another human disaapeared, and Arya was reduced to a badass stereotype, and a tool to make people in bars cheer loudly. 

*”Oh yes, the audience hates Freys, and they love Arya. Let’s have her murder them all with a badass speech and no consequences, murder is cool! Oh, Meryn Trant?  He’s on Arya’s list, but I don’t know if people hate him enough, let’s suddenly make him a pedophile!* 

As this show progresses, we see that most characters stop being morally complex, and could easily fall into a good vs. bad guy cathegory. It doesn’t matter what they have done, when they’re a fan favourite, they can do no wrong. Just as...



#**Jon Snow**

When Jon becomes Lord Commander, he starts suffering from a serious case of whitewashing. His position requires him to make hard choices, as any leading position in Westeros does. So let me bring you up to speed - In the books, Mance Ryder had a son. Since Melissandre is currently on The Wall, Jon fears that she would want to use the said son in a ritual, and burn him alive since he has king’s blood. To prevent this, he switches Gilly’s baby with Mance’s son in secret, and commands Sam and Gilly to go to The Citadel. 


It’s a clear case of a hard, morally questionable choice. He may be saving a life of an innocent baby, but in the process he has to separate a mother from her child, and leave Little Sam at The Wall, putting him in danger. The show decided to not include any of this, because as I said, the “good guys” can do no wrong. This amongst other things is the reason why Jon and others feel less and less like characters in the later seasons, and more like a bunch of plot devices just designed to go from one place to another. But he is far from the worst victims of this whitewashing phenomenon...



#**Tyrion Lannister**

Oh, the Tysha confession. You must’ve heard about it a thousand times, so I’ll keep it short. When Tyrion escapes the black cell with Jaime’s help, his brother confesses that Tyrion’s first wife, Tysha, wasn’t a whore paid by Jaime at all. Their father just made Jaime lie. She was a normal girl who fell in love with Tyrion. That’s why he went and killed Tywin. When he asked him where Tysha is, Tywin answered with a simple *”wherever whores go.”* They were supposed to be talking about Tysha, not Shae.


*(By the way, it makes no sense to shoot your father for saying that an actual whore, who you yourself called a whore, is in fact a whore. Didn’t really work with Shae, just saying.)*


Not only they made Tyrion’s murder of Shae into a self defense, because the audience likes Tyrion, therefore he just *can not* kill a defenseless woman, by skipping the Tysha confession, they basically rendered Tyrion useless for the rest of the show. After Jaime told him, he swore revenge against him and their sister. They did not part on good terms in the slightest, and then Tyrion spiralls into a pit of depression and hatered for his family, himself, and the whole world. If he still cared about Jaime, why would he bring Daenerys to Westeros, if he knew that his brother is on the other side, and that he’s the kind of guy who’s capable of charging at a dragon? He wouldn’t.  (To be clear, I’m not saying that book!Tyrion doesn’t care about Jaime, he obviously still does, but after he escapes, he’s blinded by rage and thirst for revenge, so he would be capable of that.)


If they truly wished for Jaime and Tyrion to remain on good terms, I’m okay with that. As I said in the beginning, there is nothing wrong with straying from the source material, as long as it makes sense at the end. I would be okay with the show replacing Tyrion’s depressive period with some another way to develop his character. The problem is that they replaced it with nothing. From the end of season 4 to the moment he decides he no longer wishes to be Dany’s Hand at the end of season 8, there is absolutely no character progression and development for him. He stayes the same. I guess they tried to do the whole “Dany made Tyrion believe in the world again” when she named him her Hand, but just as I said with Sansa’s intellingence, there has to be a setup for a payoff to work. No Tysha confession, no setup. But Tyrion wasn’t the only character hurt by skipping this detail, which brings me to...



#**Jaime Lannister**

When Jaime confesses, Tyrion, in his rage, informs Jaime that Cersei has been unfaithful to him, with multiple people. And since then, just as Tyrion can’t stop wondering *where do the whores go,* Jaime can’t stop thinking about his sisters infidelity. It’s the first stepping stone to Jaime leaving her at the end of AFFC. Now I’m not saying that Jaime isn’t coming back to Cersei in the books. I’m not saying he is. Either way his “redemption” and moral decision goes, I’ll just be happy as long as he continues to be as well written as he is now. 


But in the show, him not learning about Cersei fucking the Moon Boy for all I know caused that he stayed with her for too long. His whole character arc in the show would’ve been ok, if he decided to leave around season 6, spent season 7 finding out who he is without her and exploring his relationship with Brienne, and then decided to come back to his sister just before they both die. It was incredibly rushed, and I’m sorry, but shagging Brienne and leaving seven minutes later, with only contemplating present being Nikolaj dramatically staring in the distance with pained expression for five seconds, is not a proper way to handle characters decisions, especially not the life changing ones.


But the problem with Jaime in the show is rooted far deeper, in his characterisation itself and fandom’s perception of him. And I don’t really know if I can fault the show for that. Well, for an extent, I certainly can. In the books, most of who Jaime is isn’t revealed through his actions, but in a way he thinks. Often it happens when he says one thing, while thinking the complete opposite, which is why I have certain sympathies towards showrunners trying to bring his characters to a TV screen. It must be very hard to convey him in proper manner. That’s why he was mostly reduced to “a bad guy that’s secretly a good guy,” then throwing in a few show original out of character unforgivables (otherwise known as *The Cousins Fate* and *Accidental Not-Rape*) without realising that the audience is not here to forgive Jaime, not here to watch his “redemption arc,” because there is none. Morally gray doesn’t mean a person being bad at first and then good, or vice versa. It’s not black and white, it’s just gray. 


It is natural that when you’re adapting a story, a lot of characters dialogues doesn’t make it to the TV screen. But I think that since it’s very hard to show Jaime as he is to the audience, (obviously you can’t have Nikolaj say what Jaime is thinking out loud,) the show should’ve let more of his dialogues through. I feel it could’ve helped in his portrayal. 


*(Also, I know I said I wasn’t going to talk about the later seasons, but I can’t contain myself on this one, so I just gotta say: Euron Greyjoy suddenly emerging from the depths and proceeding to fight Jaime for no reason was the most ridiculous shit I’ve seen in a long time. It was so absurd, I couldn’t stop laughing the whole scene. Yes, I laughed when Jaime, my absolute favourite character not only in ASOIAF but probably in all of literature, was getting stabbed to death. Him running around briskly for the rest of the episode with three fatal stab wounds was just a cherry on top. What a great scene.)*



#**Cersei Lannister**

Book!Cersei and show!Cersei are very different people, and I don’t mind that in the slightest. Mostly, Cersei in the show suffers from the lack of consequences, and the lack of insight about her rule. The consequences I’m talking about aren’t from the other houses - they did the best they could do, supported Daenerys. But from the smallfolk. The queen they loved, Maergery, is suddenly dead. Before Cersei siezed Highgarden, there was probably not enough food in the city, since the alliance with Tyrells burned down in flames, literally. The war is expensive - building so many ballistas, The Golden Company, was there enough money to feed the people of the city? We don’t know. Why should we root for Daenerys to rule Westeros (beside the fact that she’s our favourite character,) why should we be convinced that she’ll be a better ruler than Cersei, when we have no idea about what kind of ruler Cersei is? Since there were not revolts, should we assume that she’s a good one? Or that she’s a bad one because Dany says so?

There is also a problem with the *valonqar* prophecy, that had no place being in the show, since book!Cersei and show!Cersei are fundementally different people. The prophecy is book!Cersei’s main drive, but show!Cersei’s drive are her children. Book!Cersei does everything she can to prevent the prophecy from coming true, fulfilling it in the process, because her true fear is her own demise, not her childrens. If the same could be applied to show!Cersei, since the part about her own demise was skipped, she’s only doing everything she can so that her children stay alive, for the sake of her children. Which is something every mother in her situation would do, with or without a prophecy, especially when her children serve important positions as Kings, who are constantly in danger. So as opposed to in the books, it served no purpose.



#**Daenerys Targaryen**

Dany and Jaime have a similar problem in the show, but with Dany it could be easily solvable. In the books, Dany chooses to try at diplomacy while she rules in Mereen. During that, she is constantly conflicted between doing what she thinks is right, and her inner conqueror, the blood of the dragon. After she escapes Mereen and is stranded by Drogon, just before she is found by the khalasaar, she realizes that her rule in Mereen was a failure, and (with a little help from a Quaithe vision) realizes that to win the iron throne, she must embrace the fire and blood. In the show, this realization never comes, and instead of gradually building Dany up to do something horrible (burning the King’s Landing, for example,) she goes from 0 to a 100. Yes, there was foreshadowing in the show. But just as The Red Wedding was foreshadowed (in Dany’s vision, for example,) it is not enough. Characters have to do stuff to get there. 


Yes, Daenerys made a lot of questionable decisions. Crucifying the masters, for example. The important distinction is that she did *what she thought was right in the moment.* When she burned down King’s Landing, she wasn’t doing what is right, she did what she thought was *necessary* for her to rule the seven kingdoms. She was willing to do a horrible thing to get to her goal, and that’s the important difference. That’s the point her character needed to get to, and in the show, it just didn’t. 



#**Bran Stark**


*”I have watched you, with a thousand eyes and one,” said the Three Eyed Crow, referencing a song about himself, a skinchanger and greenseer with one eye, while played by an actor with two eyes.*


Sorry, I just had to. It made me laugh a little when he said it, why even reference it when you decide to never mention Bloodraven’s identity again. Brynden Rivers is one of my favourite characters, you can’t fault me for being a bit salty. 

Anyway, Bran. This goes mainly to the marketing team - You can’t market your show with slogans like “Who wins the throne?” and presenting the throne as a reward, while simultaneously trying to convey a message that sitting on the throne is not a reward. I know Bran as a king is from GRRMs head (as is “Mad Queen Dany” probably,) but maybe don’t make the character who sits on the throne in the end dissapear for a whole season. 

His time in Bloodraven’s cave was a perfect opportunity to find out about how his powers work, what can he do, the Other’s motivations, or maybe some time for Bran to finally show what kind of person he is other than a person who “has to find a three eyed raven,” which is all he was in the show for most of the time. Make him do something. Make him make a proper difference by using his powers. We got the the point where the only reasonable explanation is my boy Brynden luring Bran into his cave just to warg him and rule the kingdoms himself, after concluding that all the available Targs are useless, while fAegon got lost at sea. 


Well, that’s all of them, so I’m done for now. Thank you all for reading. 

(Oh wow, just looked at it, that’s long. Let’s see if someone reads it, if not, I’m going to split it into multiple posts.)",asoiaf
200,"The consensus on this sub is that GRRM will never finish ASOIAF. I can only see two eventual outcomes:

1. The series remains unfinished. All we have is fan fiction (incl. the show), and our own imagination, to fill in the gaps and conclude character arcs. Unfinished chapters and notes may eventually be released, giving at least some closure.
2. The series is finished by another writer. I don't think this can produce a satisfactory narrative. For GRRM, ASOIAF is his magnus opus. It is what he will be always remembered for. This adds a tremendous incentive to make it as good as possible, sinking years of effort into each book to make it compelling and consistent. This kind of motivation would simply not be present for any other writer, no matter how much money people throw at him. Even if he is as skilled as GRRM, he won't be motivated enough to finish ASOIAF in a way it deserves.

But what if George decides that finishing the series is too hard, and opts instead to release the rest of the narrative in a dry tone reminiscent of Fire &amp; Blood? He would be able to resolve all the plot points, answer all the questions, and conclude character arcs in a satisfactory manner. And it would be vastly less time-consuming to write. The downside is, that it would not be enjoyable to read, and practically all the elements that make ASOIAF great (apart from the story) would be absent. Think unreliable narrators, incomplete information, character struggle from their POVs, food description, etc.

In Sansa I ASOS, Olenna and Margaery are telling Sansa about her grandson Willas: 

“‘He was hurt as a squire, riding in his first tourney,’ Margaery confided. ‘His horse fell and crushed his leg. That snake of a Dornishman was to blame, that Oberyn Martell. And his maester as well.” 

Maybe this gives some chronology to Oberyn’s adventures with Marwyn because Willas is Mace’s oldest son and heir. Also it points to some anti-Tyrell scheming on their part. I wonder how that might play into a potential Rhoynish Restoration Plan or if it’s just another instance of the Tyrell-Martell animosity.

I'm reading the books for the first time after watching the entire show.

Rhaegar looks at her and says something like ""There should be one more. The dragon has three heads."" 

I'm wondering what he's referencing here? Does he count Aegon and Dany as each one head, and imply she must look for one more? What about Viserys or himself? Does this Rhaegar know what has happened in Dany's present timeline? Does this lead some to think that Tyrion, or someone else, is another Targaryen bastard?

Both regions are Targaryen loyalists, supporting them even when the Targaryen on the throne is a dangerous psychopath and genocidal maniac. I think they will unite again under fAegon and/or Daenaerys. I think it is even foreshadowed given how upset Lord Rowan was when Tywin mentioned Elia Martell and her children.

Geographically it seems to be closest to House Vance of Wayfarer's Rest, but they are never said to be the lords of it.

Here are some facts that just about anyone in Westeros could know: Rhaegar ""kidnapped"" Lyanna, then disappeared with her somewhere in the South for several months. After the taking of Kings Landing, Ned went south with some companions looking for Lyanna. Lyanna died of something either before or shortly after Ned found her, then Ned reappeared with her bones and a baby some months after after delivering Arthur Dayne's sword to Starfall. There's certainly no proof, but that ain't the toughest nut in the Seven Kingdoms to crack either.

The consensus in-universe seems to be that Ned had Jon at Starfall, either with Ashara or Wylla, but the truth (or at least what readers assume is the truth) really isn't THAT tough to puzzle out from what the general public knows. Even if you didn't know that Lyanna and Rhaegar eloped, their mutual monthslong disappearance + Lyanna's unexplained death (in a world where death by childbirth would be relatively common) + Ned reappearing with a mysterious baby, I mean...that HAS to have sparked at least a few people to put the truth more or less together.

214,"Lately, I’ve been thinking about what potential clues and setup GRRM may have put in for King Bran and the ending. And I’ve been particularly intrigued by the famed “Southron ambitions” comments in ADWD.

To recap: these are a pair of brief but extremely portentous comments Lady Dustin makes to Theon, alluding to some sort of secret conspiracy that could have motivated Rickard Stark’s actions in the years before Robert’s Rebellion.

## A plan to unite five great houses

Let’s take them in reverse order. In the quote that gives the theory its name, Lady Dustin suggests the Stark/Tully betrothal was motivated by Rickard’s “Southron ambitions.”

&gt;“The day I learned that Brandon was to marry Catelyn Tully, though … there was nothing sweet about *that* pain. He never wanted her, I promise you that. He told me so, on our last night together… but Rickard Stark had great ambitions too. *Southron* ambitions that would not be served by having his heir marry the daughter of one of his own vassals.” (ADWD THEON V)

As Stefan Sasse wrote in [a great old essay](https://towerofthehand.com/blog/2012/01/05-southron-ambitions/), it does seem rather conspicuous in retrospect that the Starks, Tullys, Arryns, Baratheons, and Lannisters were all trying to get so… close in the years before the Rebellion.

* Robert Baratheon and Ned Stark were the wards of Jon Arryn
* Then there was the Brandon Stark / Catelyn Tully betrothal
* And the Robert Baratheon / Lyanna Stark betrothal
* And even a potential Jaime Lannister / Lysa Tully marriage

All this would have tied together five great houses, leaving out only Greyjoy, Tyrell, Martell… and of course Targaryen. In fact, all this seems like a rather blatant threat to the power of the Targaryens. Perhaps it even went so far as a plot to overthrow them.

## The maester's plan

Less discussed is how ""southron ambitions"" plays into a potential maester conspiracy. That is, in Lady Dustin's earlier quote, she had something else to say about Lord Rickard — that he got his ideas, including for the Tully marriage, specifically from Winterfell’s maester, who she says the bastard of an Oldtown archmaester and a Hightower girl:

&gt;""Out of gratitude we give them a place beneath our roof and make them privy to all our shames and secrets, a part of every council. And before too long, the ruler has become the ruled. That was how it was with Lord Rickard Stark. Maester Walys was his grey rat's name. And isn't it clever how the maesters go by only one name, even those who had two when they first arrived at the Citadel? That way we cannot know who they truly are or where they come from … but if you are dogged enough, you can still find out.  
&gt;  
&gt;Before he forged his chain, Maester Walys had been known as Walys Flowers. Flowers, Hill, Rivers, Snow … we give such names to baseborn children to mark them for what they are, but they are always quick to shed them. Walys Flowers had a Hightower girl for a mother … and an archmaester of the Citadel for a father, it was rumored. The grey rats are not as chaste as they would have us believe. Oldtown maesters are the worst of all. Once he forged his chain, his secret father and his friends wasted no time dispatching him to Winterfell to fill Lord Rickard's ears with poisoned words as sweet as honey. The Tully marriage was his notion, never doubt it, he—"" (ADWD THEON IV)

That bit really sticks out, particularly because Lady Dustin is interrupted and doesn't get to finish her thought. At the time, the purpose of all this mainly seemed to be backstory: more information about Robert’s Rebellion.

But is it also intended as foreshadowing and setup for the end of the series?

## The world the Citadel is building

To note the obvious: Bran Stark fulfills his grandfather Rickard’s southron ambitions, possibly beyond his wildest dreams, by becoming king of Westeros in the south.

Then there’s the role of the maesters. Oldtown is introduced with great fanfare in AFFC, getting both the prologue and the final chapter. That signifies the maesters are important in the books, in a way they never were in the show.

In particular, Marwyn reveals that the maesters killed the old Targaryen dragons, and suggests they will try to kill Dany too. This is because they are “building” a “world” in which magic will have no place:

&gt;“If I tell you, they may need to kill you too.” Marywn smiled a ghastly smile, the juice of the sourleaf running red between his teeth. “Who do you think killed all the dragons the last time around? Gallant dragonslayers armed with swords?” He spat. “The world the Citadel is building has no place in it for sorcery or prophecy or glass candles, much less for dragons. Ask yourself why Aemon Targaryen was allowed to waste his life upon the Wall, when by rights he should have been raised to archmaester. His blood was why. He could not be trusted. No more than I can.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“What will you do?” asked Alleras, the Sphinx.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Get myself to Slaver’s Bay, in Aemon’s place. The swan ship that delivered Slayer should serve my needs well enough. The grey sheep will send their man on a galley, I don’t doubt. With fair winds I should reach her first.” (AFFC SAM V)

So the maesters want the dragons and the Targaryens dead. They also want to build a new world. Perhaps that's a world with an elective rather than a hereditary monarchy? Perhaps this is what they wanted all along, back when Walys was whispering in Rickard's ear...  and perhaps they even told them he could lead that elective monarchy. That would be quite the southron ambition. And perhaps, a generation later, the old plot will be carried out by making Rickard's grandson king of Westeros.

An apparent problem for this theory is, of course, that putting the very magical Bran on the throne is an odd way to wipe out magic from the world. Yet in the world of the books, it's not necessarily clear that Bran will keep his magical abilities at the end of the series (I've thought they'd make him a bit too overpowered).

It's also not necessarily clear that Bran's magic will be common knowledge. There could be some trickery involved — that is, Sam and Tyrion could subvert the maester plot. Both of them know Bran, and Sam has experience swinging leadership elections and the inside view into the Citadel's inner workings. So they could present Bran as a mere crippled boy, the heir to Winterfell but a threat to no one... and he could end up a powerful king no one expects.

**tl;dr: ""Southron ambitions"" and the maesters' conspiracy could be setup for the end of the series — the downfall of the Targaryens, and the move of Westeros to an elective monarchy under King Bran the Broken.**",asoiaf

216,"For fun, I wanted to ask any and all fans of ASOIAF to see how they feel about certain moments of Westerosi history as well as their own theories to major mysteries. 

To be fair, I share my own answers.  

1. Greens or Blacks?   
Blacks. Rhaenyra was declared the King's Heir, and the lords swore holy oaths to uphold this. She was the rightful heir to the throne. 
2. Red or Black Dragon?  
Black Dragon. If I was a person in Westeros I would have nothing but confusion that would lead me to supporting Daemon. The King gave Blackfyre, the sword of the Conqueror, that had been held by every Targaryen King to Daemon. Why would he do that if not to show his favor to Daemon? Also, Aegon the Unworthy always doubted Daeron's legitimacy. So much doubt.
3. Robert or Rhaegar?  
Because no one would know how/why Rhaegar abducted Lyanna, Robert would be who I supported. Robert was fighting for a seemingly noble cause and to end a tyrannical reign. Rhaegar was officially fighting for his father, which was not an appealing prospect by that point.
4. Baelor, starved or poisoned?  
Probably poisoned. Baelor was losing what shreds of sanity he had as he ventured more into his piety. He probably was planning to go to war. Viserys II had to stop his nephew from starting another civil war. 
5. Viserys II, old or poisoned?  
I will give Aegon IV the miniscule benefit of the doubt and say that Viserys II probably was just old. It would be a fitting irony if Viserys II poisoned the last King only to be poisoned himself. But Aegon IV seems a little too lazy to even do a murderous plot.
6. Best Aegon?  
Egg. Easy.
7. Worst person to sit on the Iron Throne?  
In many ways, Aerys I may be the actual worst for his complete disinterest in ruling. If not for Bloodraven, Aerys I's reign would have been an utter disaster. But definitely it goes down to Aegon IV for ending up creating a rival family for the throne which led to a century of civil wars. Thanks!
8. What happened at Summerhall?  
I am sadly with Steven Attewell, Egg was desperate enough to attempt to sacrifice Baby Rhaegar to bring forth the dragons. Dunk stopped him, causing a disaster that destroyed Summerhall. Dunk saved Rhaegar, and Aerys II.
9. What was going on between Ashara Dayne and Ned Stark?  
A short summer romance that the honorable Ned Stark put aside to do his duty and marry Catelyn Tully. The final fate of Ashara Dayne is a little too fairy tale for ASOIAF.
10. Best Hand of the King?  
Tie between Viserys II and Bloodraven. I admire Hands who have to overcome the inadequacies of their King.",asoiaf
217,"So I am just starting up the Dance of the Dragons section of “Fire and Blood”. I already know the story vaguely from having listened to an audiobook version of the Princess and the Queen and done some reading in the past

I find myself almost wholly in favour of one side over the other - The Blacks

I was wondering if this was supposed to be the reading or if others interpreted this differently 

Perhaps my bias might come from how clearly this is based mostly on the Anarchy in real history and how Aegon, despite being a true born son in this telling is the parallel of Stephen of Blois - the one with the much weaker claim in the Anarchy (I guess only if you discount the gender thing)

Or perhaps it is just how clearly the previous king had made his decision in both cases and had it schemed away

So is George supposed to be leading us to a certain view? Or a view that both were as bad as each other 

Is all the council stuff supposed to make us see that the greens at least had a good argument in their own minds established by some degree of precedent ? I just have absolutely no sympathy for them for defying the clear will of their monarch. (And yes this has happened countless times in real history , not just the Anarchy parallel )

218,"We are 5 books into a 7 book series.
There are 2 unpublished books left to resolve all the many plots and sub-plots. 
I am concerned (not worried) that there isn't enough room to give them satisfactory resolutions.

I personally would prefer to have 8 or 9 books. Now that the TV adaptation is over, I am in no rush to reach the end of the story.

And they either removed the characters, or removed %99 of their chapters, while replacing it with the shittiest plot they could come up with. No need to mention 20 good men, Dorne plot etc, it has been discussed enough.

Season 5 wasnt even %1 good compare to Dance. In Season 6,7 and 8, they didnt had any material at least, yeah 7 and 8 are worst but 5 pissed me off more. And actors kept sayin ""D&amp;D are so passionate about the books"" , yeah thats why they removed %95 of the characters and plots from Feast and Dance.

222,"Bran becoming the King turned out to be a very controversial ending. Even more so because it was confirmed to be the book ending as well. Even leaving the horrible execution of the scene aside, many people take issue with the idea of King Bran itself, either claiming that it will suck in the books just like in the showl or, bizarrely, saying that the books will end differently despite us being directly told that the major beats of the ending will be the same and that King Bran is George's idea.

I tend to think that the idea itself is rather interesting, and can work in the books. So in this post, i'll try to adress the popular criticisms of *Bran the Broke*n and prove to you that it can, and hopefully will work in the hands of GRRM.

* **Bran has no claim**

*The Starks have never ruled anything but the North. They are not related to Targaryens in any way, so they can't make a claim like Robert.*

First of all, with all Targaryens either dead or out of the picture, no one has a strong claim. And the bunring of the iron throne is suppose to imply the end of an era. So a new king will not be chosen based on his relation to the previoud dynasty.  New dynasty, new king, new rules.

* **Why would anyone choose Bran at the Great Council?**

*Bran's name comes up very randomly during the Castle. ""Who has a better story than Bran the Broken?"", Tyrion says, and for some reason eveyone accepts it as a valid arguments and they problaim Bran the King. Why would they do that? Wouldn't each of the high lords want to make a claim?*

Yes, this was stupid. What this shows us is that D&amp;D knew they had to make Bran the King, but had no idea how to make it happen. And while the power of stories is indeed a bif theme in his story, it's definitely not enough. There need to be more. There needs to be an actual in-universe reason for it.

I think the big difference that will lead to Bran's reign is the global changes in the Westeros landscape. The Long Night was not really long in the show. But i have no doubt that GRRM is planning to deliver on the horrors he set up, and the Others won'be be defeated in on single fight. The Long Night in the books is the event that will completely change everything.

The Others, the Dragons, Greenseers and Skinchangers, Red Priests, Faceless Men and undead of all types... These are the figures that will take the central stage in the last act of the story. The show always downplayed such elements and their influence on the world as a whole (just look at how no one cares about Jon's resurrection), but in the books it will change Westeros on a fundamental level.

How will it lead to Bran the Broken? Well, first of all, if Bran plays a major role in defeating the Others, he will earn the claim on that merit alone.

&gt;Lord Seaworth is a man of humble birth, but he reminded me of my duty, when all I could think of was my rights. I had the cart before the horse, Davos said. I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne.

In ASOS, Davos reminds Stannis that he has to defend his realm, or he is no king at all. Because what are kings for, if not for protecting their people? Well, it probably won't end well Stannis, but this logic may put Bran on the throne at the end. After the War for the Dawn, people will look at those who saved them as their new leaders.

Second, in a world that was almost ended by a supernatural threat, it makes total sense to elect someone who'll be able to deal with these types of issues in the future. With Dany dead, who is the next candidate from this perspective?

Another big point in Bran's favor is that in many ways, he is the most inoffensive choice. Due to being removed from the political realm for so long, he hasn't made many enemies. So i can totally see him being a compromise option.

* **Why won't the lords of the seven kingdoms just declare independence?**

*Sansa proclaims the North independent, and no one is bothered. Why don't the Iron Islands and Dorne separate as well? Yara was even promised independence by Daenerys!*

I think independant North is an obvious show invention. They really wanted to have that *""Queen in the North""* moment. But it makes no sense. You can't have North separating and everyone else being okay with it.

Even more important, it makes zero narrative sense. The Others are the ultimate proof, that the realm needs to be united. Divided kingdom is a weak one. Fighting over lands, gold and power is exactly what will bring Westeros at the bring of destruction when the Long Night comes. Uniting is what will save it.

Therefore, it makes no sense for the Kingdoms to immediately separate after learning the ultimate lesson about the need for unity.

* **Bran is too young and unexperienced**

*Bran is about 7 years old at the start of the story and 10 by the end of ADWD. How do you make him the endgame king in a believable and satisfying way?*

Age is an issue, that's true. But that's the price of abandoning the infamous five year gap.  As GRRM himself has said: *""If a twelve-year old has to conquer the world, then so be it.""*

I also think GRRM may have found a way to write his way around Bran's age. Bloodraven.

Since the beginning of season 7, the show has been saying that Bran *""is not longer Bran but a Three Eyed Raven""*. And despite the poor execution, that turned Bran into a boring non-character throwing lines from previous seasons at people, the idea itself is so in-line with GRRM's writing, that i find it hard to believe it didn't come from him. *Divine power comes with a price.*

&gt;Stay, and the Many-Faced God will take your ears, your nose, your tongue. He will take your sad grey eyes that have seen so much. He will take your hands, your feet, your arms and legs, your private parts. He will take your hopes and dreams, your loves and hates.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Can I dwell on what I scarce remember? I held a castle on the Marches once, and there was a woman I was pledged to marry, but I could not find that castle today, nor tell you the color of that woman's hair. Who knighted me, old friend? What were my favorite foods? It all fades. Sometimes I think I was born on the bloody grass in that grove of ash, with the taste of fire in my mouth and a hole in my chest. Are you my mother, Thoros?""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""I ate,"" said Bran. ""We ran down an elk and had to drive off a treecat that tried to steal him."" The cat had been tan-and-brown, only half the size of the direwolves, but fierce. He remembered the musky smell of him, and the way he had snarled down at them from the limb of the oak.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The wolf ate,"" Jojen said. ""Not you. Take care, Bran. *Remember who you are*.""

The idea, that the active use of magic can cost you your own soul is ever present in the books. So Bran and never been the same after is as GRRM as it gets.

But how exactly will Bran change? Well, once again, i think the show got the basics of this correct. Bran will be merged with Bloodraven.

&gt;Before long he was flying around the cavern, weaving through the long stone teeth that hung down from the ceiling, even flapping out over the abyss and swooping down into its cold black depths.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then he realized he was not alone.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Someone else was in the raven,"" he told Lord Brynden, once he had returned to his own skin. ""Some girl. I felt her.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""A woman, of those who sing the song of earth,"" his teacher said. ""Long dead, yet a part of her remains, just as a part of you would remain in Summer if your boy's flesh were to die upon the morrow. A shadow on the soul. She will not harm you.""  
&gt;  
&gt;*Bran III, ADWD*

From Bran, to Orell to Varamyr - the idea of skinchangers living a second life inside their animals is well established. And Varamyr's Prologue establishes another important aspect - trying to take away another human's body.

So if we take this ideas and apply them to the show's context, what will we get? Bloodraven reaching for Bran in his dying moments, either trying to pass some knowledge to him or possible to take over his body and in the process imprinting himself on Bran. *A shadow on the soul.*

I think in one way or the other, some of Bloodraven's experiences, secrets and character traits will be passed to Bran. And Bloodraven used to be the hand of the king. He was a greenseer and a ruler of Westeros before Bran. He is the precedent, a blueprint for Bran the Broken. And a shadow of Bloodraven on Bran's soul will probably be an big part of Bran's character till the very end.

I think this may be GRRM's cheat code to make some radical changes to Bran's character without 5 year gap to work with. And Jon Snow's death and resurrection will probably serve a similar function.

* **How is becoming King a satisfying end for Bran?**

*Bran's story was always magic based. The first two books had him learing how to be a lord/a prince, but even then there was always a sense that the endgame for Bran will be all about magic.*

Well, what would be a perfect ending for Bran? Most people tend to say, that it would be him becoming some sort of magical protector, looking over Westeros using his powers. And i agree. *But that's exactly the type of king he's going to be.*

Like i said before, the world will be a very different place by the end of ASOIAF. The magical realm was in the background at the beginning. The Others slowly returning beyond the Wall, the dragons, children of the forest and the giants all thought to be gone forever... And since the end of the first book, magic has been slowly finding it's back into the world.

By the end of the story, the magical and political realm will be deeply tied together. So Brandon Stark, someone who was raised as a lord and then was trained to be a greenseer, works rather well as the endgame ruler. So instead of a king on the Iron Throne, we'll have a greenseer on a weirwood throne. Symbolising transition to a world of high fantasy.

**TLDR: After breaking away from Targaryen dynasty for good, the lords of Westeros will turn their eyes towards Bran - a man who played a key part in saving Westeros and is well-equipped to act as king on both political and magical realms.**",asoiaf
223,"I would have loved to see some excuse for the show to visit the Isle, even though I'm not sure it ever gets visited in the books either (I'm only at the end Book 1, but have read a lot of the wiki). It just seems like one of those vaguely fantastic areas (like the Wall or the cellar of the Red Keep) that would have been cool to see depicted.

GRRM's vision suffered due to this limit when he had to split AFfC and ADwD like he did, again when he had to publish ADwD without an ending, and I have a strong feeling he's wrestling with it again as we speak, trying to cram TWoW into less than 1500 manuscript pages.

226,"# Toy Soldier Theory

Back in 2016, before Jon Snow was resurrected on the show, I wrote [this tinfoily theory](https://weirwoodleviathan.wordpress.com/2016/04/27/iii-now-i-am-become-death-legacy-of-a-toy-soldier/) (I kinda hate linking people to this because in hindsight I think the theory is so silly, and reveals how goofy my writing style was) that Jon's soul wouldn't really ever return to his body from Ghost. That instead, the big twist of the series would be that Bran reanimates Jon's dead body with his own soul, and lives out the Azor Ahai/TPTWP myth through Jon. I speculated that because of the way skinchanging works, we would no longer get Jon's POV, and Bran would experience his time in Jon's body like a dream, slowly losing himself to the identity of the body he's inhabiting.

This became known a ""Toy Soldier theory.""

This theory was loosely inspired by The Never Ending Story, and was my attempt to reconcile Martin's seemingly inconsistent portrayals of resurrection, and the common chosen one imagery associated with both Jon and Bran. Despite all of the King setup for Jon, I always felt the story was ultimately about putting Bran into power, so I was trying to figure a way to that. Though it never got much mainstream love from the authorities within the fandom, it was received surprisingly well considering that it asserted Jon's story pretty much ends in ADWD. Given the timing I get it though. We were nearing Jon's resurrection, and people were having last minute doubts.

Of course, eventually I abandoned the theory and started to see the need for Jon's internal story to continue. Besides, as it turns out GRRM had confirmed that Jon will eventually learn the truth of his parentage, which was incompatible with Bran controlling Jon's dead body. I moved on, and sort f just let Toy Soldier theory die.

Or so I thought.

After the ending revealed King Bran, the premise of Toy Soldier theory made a sudden comeback. An old theory I had which I now considered ridiculous, was suddenly all the rage. Getting over 8k upvotes [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/btfx0g/spoilers_extended_theres_a_plot_thread_missing/), and even being [suggested as a plausible ending](https://youtu.be/50aa3Ahzr9s?t=1370) by u/Elio_Garcia and Linda (though they swapped King Jon ""the Winged Wolf"" out for King Euron ""Crow's Eye."") Either way, we got a twist ending and now my weird theory is getting a lot of attention.

And I'm just over here like... *guys, wtf.*

# The Implausibility of a Body Snatcher King

It's hard to determine just where to begin dismantling my theory, because I'm very aware that not everyone who now ascribes to it believes in an identical version to the one I initially put forward. But generally speaking, I now consider an ending where Bran bodysnatches his way to the throne is implausible. **The premise undermines the point of the ending, isn't set up by Bran's arc, isn't how warging actually works, and is just too dark to end the story with a never ending mind rape, whether the victim is the hero, or the villain.**

The moment I knew with full confidence that King Bran was absolutely from GRRM, was when Tyrion said ""Bran the Broken."" Not only because this is a phrase never set up in the show, but used extensively in the books to highlight the central obstacle of Bran's story, but because it encapsulated the underlying point of the ending. That the person at one point seen as ""broken"" was now being hailed for that very thing. Westeros had found it's [Bran the Blessed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%A2n_the_Blessed). It's [Fischer King.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_King)

Of course, this premise (which I would never ever ever expect D&amp;D could come up with), is completely undermined if the ascension to Kingship is done through body snatching. If Westeros is hailing ""King Aegon VII"" or ""King Euron Crow's Eye"" while Bran is secretly pulling the strings (but the Old Gods are pulling the strings behind him?), then there is no subversion or celebration of Bran the Broken. It remains Bran's point of shame, and it's never made into Bran's strength (as Tyrion would advise).

A body snatcher king ending is also pretty messed up for Bran's arc.

When I initially posited that Bran skinchange Jon, it was the accidental skinchanging of a dead body, and the reason he remained was that he could live out his deep seated desire to be a knight. This kind of thing vaguely made sense for Bran in light of how he'd skinchange Hodor really just to walk and feel whole again, and to be included. This sympathetic motivation is contrasted against the utter horror of what Bran is doing, which is essentially likened to rape, and called ""abomination.""

But to have Bran commit this sort of atrocity at the end for the sake of some kind of political motivation is not only very dark, it's not set up in Bran's character. For me, the implication behind ""Hold the Door"" seems to be that Bran will come to see the evil in what he has been doing to Hodor, and have some kind of change of heart or come to some kind of moral awakening. Yet if this 10 year old goes from mid raping Hodor to compensate for his disability, to mind raping someone else to exert control over Westeros, then there is no lesson. This is especially true if the person being skinchanged is a family member, or an innocent, but also true if it's a villain like Euron.

What's more, I don't think this ending really fully takes into consideration the consequences of skinchanging. As we have seen throughout the story, skinchanging another entity has consequences on both entities. When Bran wargs into Summer, he effectively becomes Summer. He is filled with Summer's desires, and perceives as Summer does. So if Bran were to hypothetically warg into Euron, it wouldn't be a simple mind replacement. Bran would effectively start to become more like Euron, and take on attributes of Euron's persona and desires. A King Euron who is possessed by Bran would not simply be King Bran in Euron's body, it would be a merging of both characters into one being. The spectre of Euron Crow's Eye would always be there, influencing the thoughts and actions of the endgame king.

But even on the off chance that Bran was somehow able to compartmentalize Euron, or Jon, or whoever he was supposedly body snatching. Such an ending is just too dark to ever be considered bittersweet. Martin's exploration of power would effectively end on the most horrific tool for domination in the story being used in the most immoral possible way, destroying the life of not only the person being body snatched, but the body snatcher. Bran (who has no desire to be king), would get to walk again, but lose himself, lose his identity, leave his life, and on top of all that be alone and forgotten, and in perpetual violation of another person. Not as a puppet, nor even as a puppet master, but as the strings.

&amp;#x200B;

**In conclusion, though the premise of Bran the Body Snatcher is fun tinfoil to consider, and could have made for an interesting story in another world, it's just not super plausible and becomes far too sinister an ending to ever fit the definition of ""bittersweet."" Whether he's possessing Jon, or Euron, or Moonboy for all we know, perpetual mind rape is neither a lasting solution for Westeros, nor a satisfying ending for Bran. Thus, it's time to put away Toy Soldier theory.**",asoiaf
227,"There are 4 ethnicities that are well represented within the ASOIAF books — First Men, Rhoynar, Andals and Valyrians. I've been thinking about these ethnicities, and the fairly sparse description that GRRM likes to give us of each character, and I came to the conclusion that, given that this is a fictional world with fictional races, there is absolutely no reason for us to assume that any ethnicities in ASOIAF are perfect analogues for real life ethnicities, just as there is no ""Latin"" or ""English"" language but languages that are somewhat inspired by them.

Furthermore, it made little sense to me that GRRM would make this distinction between races and yet have 3 of them be essentially Caucasian. So partly because I have way too much time on my hands, and partly because I wanted to ""diversify"" the series while remaining true to canon and without shoehorning in POC characters, I decided to speculate on what these ethnicities would actually look like.

We can start with the First Men. As far as book canon goes, there is little to differentiate them physically from Andals (differences are generally cultural), not because they aren't different but because of centuries, if not millennia, of interbreeding between the two. We do know, however, that the First Men are better represented in the North, specifically by the Wildlings, the Starks, the Boltons and other Houses, with the addition of the mountain clans of the Vale. Based on the descriptions we are given, we can construct the beginnings of a First Men phenotype:

\- A range of hair colors and styles, ranging from dark to red (but rarely blond) and generally straight or wavy (rarely curly)

\- Eyes also have a wide range, but distinct blue and green colors also seem rare, with grey and dark eyes being common

\- The Starks are said to have long faces, other First Men can be assumed to have neither long nor short faces, so we can assume dolichocephaly and mesocephaly

\- The presence or absence of epicanthic folds is difficult to infer as eyes are generally only described by color in ASOIAF

\- Based on the size of the Umbers, we can guess that the First Men are tall

\- Skin color, if I remember correctly, is never explicitly stated for any northerners or wildlings, but we can assume it to be on the lighter end of the spectrum due to them living in cold climates. However, this does not necessarily mean fair skin — it could range from light brown to pale. What we do know is that Valyrians and Qartheen are paler, and salty/sandy Dornish and Dothraki are darker.

\- Body and facial hair is clearly common as almost all male Northern and Wildling characters have beards

\- First men appear to have a range of body types - Arya, for example, appears to be quite skinny, whilst the Greatjon is a large, stocky man.

To have a better idea of our First Men phenotype, we can look at their origins, which, if the wiki is to be believed, are in the Dothraki sea. An adaptation for grassland life seems to match with the features I described, and also implies brachyskelia and a lack of epicanthic fold, as well as supporting the idea of the First Men having light brown rather than fair skin (at least originally). Note that what I am describing is somewhat similar to how Dothraki have been described, which makes sense as they appear to originate from the same area.

Finally, we can draw parallels with real life ethnicities, while acknowledging that First Men won't correspond perfectly to any real ethnicity. Although culturally, Westeros is similar to medieval western Europe, geographically it is more similar to America. Based on this idea, an indigenous race with a variety of religions and whose culture has mostly died out apart from a few pockets seems very similar to the Native Americans. We can expect our First Men, then, to be *somewhat* similar to Native American peoples — but importantly, not a copy paste of them.

&amp;#x200B;

Using this same method, I created other phenotypes for the other ethnicities.

&amp;#x200B;

Andals:

Similar to Caucasians, but with coarser hair, weak facial and body hair, and epicanthic folds. Shorter and stockier than First Men; macroskelic, brachycephalic, mildly hypsicranic, and hyperleptorrhine. Tend towards endomorphia. Pale skin, wide range of eye color and hair color.

&amp;#x200B;

Rhoynish:

My interpretation is based upon peoples from the Nile River, hence medium brown skin, curly black hair, dark eyes, strong facial and body hair. They are described in ASOIAF as ""lithe"", leading me to assume  ectomorphic, short and brachyskelic proportions. No epicanthic folds, platyrrhine nose, dolichocephalic.

&amp;#x200B;

Valyrians:

Here I differ most from most interpretations. The geographic location of the Valyrian peninsula suggests to me India, and thus I am inclined to draw inspiration from Indian peoples — the obvious problem is that Valyrians have pale hair and skin and purple eyes. Purple eyes are not common (or even possible) in any real life humans, so I resorted to magic here: the Valyrian's appearance reminds me of the Others. They are speculated to have learned to tame dragons from an earlier, now disappeared race who I theorize were the ""fire"" counterpart to Others. Some interbreeding happened, and at least the ruling class (the dragonlords) began to inherit these pale features and purple eyes, resorting to incest to keep these features pure. I imagine the smallfolk of the Valyrian freehold would have had darker features, looking more like the real world's Indian people.

&amp;#x200B;

Aided by the images and explanations of [http://humanphenotypes.net/](http://humanphenotypes.net/), and with some poor photoshop work, I created some visual representations of my interpretation.

228,"It's well known that A Feast for Crows, even after GRRM had decided he needed to write it at all, grew in the writing until it didn't even fit into two books in the end.

Would it have been possible to write a tighter version of these books without sacrificing any other the information we were given or the atmosphere of the stories - say by combining these two Brienne chapters together, these three Sam chapters into two, these two Dany chapters into one - or do you think that every chapter adds something unique and can't be reduced/needs to stand alone?",asoiaf
229,"In AGOT, Grand Maester Pycelle offers Ned Stark a glass of iced milk when Ned arrives to question him about Jon Arryn's death:

&gt;""Wine no longer agrees with my digestion, I fear, but I can offer you a cup of iced milk, sweetened with honey. I find it most refreshing in this heat.”

Pycelle also tells Ned that Jon Arryn was fond of iced wine, and iced summerwine is served at the Hand's tourney.

&gt;“No,” Joffrey said. “My dog will do for him, or perhaps my uncle Jaime. And in a few years, when I am old enough to enter the lists, I shall do for them all.” He raised his hand to summon a servant with a flagon of iced summerwine, and poured her a cup.

Although [ice has long been used for preserving food](https://www.antiqueicetoolmuseum.org/industry-history/), iced drinks are decidedly not medieval and didn't exist until the 19th century, when an American trader [popularised them in order to increase the demand for ice.](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/04/history-of-ice-in-cocktails.html). 

Looking for an in-universe explanation - given how long summers in Westeros can be, it's very possible that the idea of using ice to cool drinks appeared earlier on than it did in our world. Transportation and storage costs would have made ice a very expensive commodity, and available only to the nobility - which fits in perfectly with AGOT, where only those in the royal court seem to have iced drinks. The Night's Watch (and presumably others in the far north) are an obvious exception, since temperatures at the Wall seem to remain mostly subzero even in the summers.

&gt;“From the Lord Commander’s own table,” Bowen Marsh told them. There were salads of spinach and chickpeas and turnip greens, and afterward bowls of iced blueberries and sweet cream.

Since there are no mentions of characters having iced drinks in ACOK, ASOS, and AFFC, I like to assume that ice is harvested in the far north, and the ice trade with the south has been disrupted due to the War of the Five Kings. It's also possible that with the summer drawing to an end, iced drinks are no longer in much demand. Unfortunately, the books don't seem to mention ice harvesting as a source of wealth for the North or even the Night's Watch, and matters are complicated in ADWD:

&gt;She would rather have drifted in the fragrant pool all day, eating iced fruit off silver trays and dreaming of a house with a red door, but a queen belongs to her people, not to herself. - Daenerys, ADWD

I have no idea how Meereen, a recently sacked city in the middle of war-torn Slaver's Bay, is getting supplies of ice. Does anyone have any in-universe explanations?

ETA - I found another troubling iced drink mention in ADWD. Tyrion notices that a popular inn in Volantis, which has an extremely hot climate, is serving iced drinks. These are clearly not reserved for the aristocracy, because Penny and the Widow of the Waterfront are staying there.

&gt;The common room of the Merchant’s House was a dim labyrinth of alcoves and grottoes built around a central courtyard where a trellis of flowering vines threw intricate patterns across the flagstone floor and green and purple moss grew between the stones. Slave girls scurried through light and shadow, bearing flagons of ale and wine and some iced green drink that smelled of mint.",asoiaf

Once I tried looking a character up just to refresh myself on who they were/their significance and the first google search result showed me their death. Do any of you know if there’s a resource for readers to look up certain characters/places in the book without seeing countless spoilers? Any help would be greatly appreciated!",asoiaf
234,"The reasons are as follows:

1) Legendary artifacts are kind of Euron's favorite thing. He has a set of Valyrian steel armor and Dragonbinder, he may have had a dragon egg at one point, and he's probably about to acquire the Horn of Joramun and glass candles from Oldtown. He's a pirate first and foremost, and what's a pirate without treasure?

2) Dawn is *the* legendary sword of Westeros, if not the world. Made from a stone that fell from the sky. As strong and sharp as Valyrian steel, but made from a completely different metal. Probably dating back all the way to the Long Night and named appropriately. A sword worthy of Euron's armor.

3) Dawn is at Starfall, by word of GRRM:

&gt;Dawn remains at Starfall, until another Sword of the Morning shall arise.

It may not be in the castle itself. Ashara Dayne might have taken it with her when she committed suicide by jumping from the Palestone Tower into the Torrentine River. But a little water is hardly going to stop Euron from finding it.

4) Starfall is fairly close to Euron's primary target of Oldtown, sitting near the westernmost edge of Dorne. It sits on an isle in the middle of the mouth of the Torrentine River, and will be quite accessible to ironborn longships. Much less a dragon if Euron binds one.

5) It is also rather close to one of Euron's secondary targets, Horn Hill, on the other side of the Red Mountains. The wooded surroundings of Horn Hill may be the burning forest from Aeron's dream, and Gilly has taken Mance Rayder and Val's son there. He may have significance for one of Euron's blood rituals.

6) A visit by Euron to Starfall will allow GRRM to tie off a loose end, Dorne's resident edgelord, Darkstar, as well as Ser Balon Swann, Obara, and Areo who have been sent after him. Perhaps Ser Harras Harlaw and the Valyrian steel sword Nightfall will be involved?

7) By claiming Dawn, Euron will be able to strengthen his claim to being Azor Ahai reborn. Many theories suggest that Euron may play the role of ""false messiah,"" and/or team up with Melisandre. Dawn, as the most thematically appropriate base for Lightbringer, would do much to strengthen his claim and convince Melisandre and others to join him.

8) Euron's Valyrian steel armor, the sword Dawn, and the bound dragon Rhaegal create a convenient package of legendary artifacts for the real Azor Ahai, probably Jon, to acquire either after Euron's death, or, in one theory I consider kind of tinfoily, through possessing Euron's body. All Euron has to do is deliver them to the North in order to set up the most epic loot drop in the history of Westeros.

9) Euron acquiring the artifacts and dragon that Jon will use, assuming Jon and Daenerys have a relationship in the books, explains how Euron is so confident he will be able to wed Daenerys. Euron most likely saw a figure using those artifacts through his captive warlocks, shade-of-the-evening dreams, greensight, or whatever, who also was in a relationship with Daenerys. He concluded it was him, when in reality it will be Jon.",asoiaf

237,"Some people here have recently been going through the 5 published books to find foreshadowing for King Bran or Jon's banishment to the Wall. The most mentioned passages have been [Cat's request for Bran to tell his story to a Great Council that will choose a new King](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/c40n17/spoilers_main_grrms_ending_for_bran_foreshadowed/), and  the [numerous parallels](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/c3rujr/spoilers_extended_aegon_targaryen_kneeling_to/ert12a6/) between the Bran/Jon exile and Aegon V/Bloodraven exile. During a reread I stumbled on a AGOT chapter, when Jeor tries to convince a conflicted Jon to accept the Mormont sword Longclaw. Jon is reluctant and thinks to himself. His mind drifts: 

&gt; When Jon had been Bran's age, he had dreamed of doing great deeds, as boys always did. The details of his feats changed with every dreaming, but quite often he imagined saving his father's life. Afterward Lord Eddard would declare that Jon had proved himself a true Stark, and place Ice in his hand. Even then he had known it was only a child's folly; no bastard could ever hope to wield a father's sword. Even the memory shamed him. **What kind of man stole his own brother's birthright?**

If ADOS has the same broad character endings as the show, then this thought of Jon's would be inverted. Rather than Jon depriving a trueborn Stark sibling, his brother Bran will indirectly steal *his* birthright. Jon would be heir to the Throne under the Targaryen succession line. But when the Great Council is convened, the lords will instead choose Bran who will (reluctantly) sentence Jon to the Wall for murdering Dany. 

Of course, it's quite possible I'm reading too much into this. Perhaps this line is simply foreshadowing Jon's temporary stint as King in the North after his resurrection, or even Renly's usurpation of Stannis. But considering how GRRM has said he's known the main characters' [**endings**](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/c77e1o/spoilers_main_at_balticon_2016_grrm_said_that_he/) for decades (even if their [*journeys*](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6nq2ti/main_spoilers_original_3page_outline_by_george_rr/) have radically changed as he wrote), it's possible that Jon's question is predicting his ignominious fate.",asoiaf

239,"In *Fire and Blood*, there's a section about an in-universe book called *A Caution for Young Girls*, and it's described as a really trashy morality tale meant to appeal to lowbrow audiences. At first, it sounds like the Westerosi equivalent to an airport novel. But then Martin has some odd word choice to describe the text:

&gt; ""We have no way to ascertain the veracity of her story, nor even whether she was in truth the author of this infamous book (some argue plausibly that the text is the product of several hands, for the style of the prose varies greatly from **episode** to **episode**)."" (*Fire and Blood*, p. 157)

I guess *A Caution for Young Girls* could be a televised soap, since it was written in episodes. Maybe a show for Lifetime or.... HBO?

Martin continues to theorize on the disputed authorship of *Caution*:

&gt; ""The scribes responsible were most likely septons expelled from the Faith for drunkenness, theft, or fornication, failed students who left the Citadel without a chain, hired quills from the Free Cities, or mummers (the worst of all). **Lacking the rigor of maesters, such scribes oft feel free to “improve” on the texts they are copying. (Mummers in particular are prone to this.)**
In the case of *A Caution for Young Girls*, **such “improvements” largely consisted of adding ever more episodes of depravity and changing the existing episodes** to make them even more disturbing and lascivious. **As alteration followed alteration over the years, it became ever more difficult to ascertain which was the original text,** to the extent that even maesters at the Citadel cannot agree as to the title of the book, as has been noted.” (*Fire and Blood*, p.158-9)

So it appears the writers of *Caution* were adapting from an existing story, thought they could improve it with unnecessary changes, and ended up making a flashy, but culturally empty work. I wonder where else we've seen something like this...",asoiaf
240,"I made a comment in another thread about a realization I had regarding as to how Bran can become King. The idea is short, based mostly on how the books will handle it and actually makes sense contrary to the show version where he is chosen for having the best story.

&amp;#x200B;

***Bran will be chosen as king / be required to be king because he is the one who defeats the Others***.

&amp;#x200B;

Unlike the show, the Others in the books will not suddenly be defeated because some ninja assassin accidentally unplugs the super computer that is controlling them. They will be defeated by either a very costly war in which Bran will be incredibly instrumental due to information that only someone deeply rooted in magic can acquire or the Others will agree to a peace treaty in which, also Bran, is the main component in communicating with them and making sure the people of Westeros abide by it.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if the Others are controlled by the Children of the Forest who are just trying to fight back from being extinct, the idea in place still works as Bran will still be the most important figure in both scenarios.  

&amp;#x200B;

If the Others are defeated by war, Bran may be chosen as king by the lords of Westeros for leading them to victory by providing important information, scouting, even having a psychic battle which helped win the war. 

&amp;#x200B;

If the Others agree to peace, it may be that Bran is the one who will broker it and not Jon. Bran will be able to communicate with the CoTF, if they are controlling the Others, or find out the details of the original peace agreement that happened after the first Long Night and come to an understanding with the Others that way. The lords will then chose Bran as king for saving the rest of humanity or part of the treaty might be that Bran must be king of Westeros in order to maintain the peace and act as a bridge between the 2 sides.

After they posted that video, HBO released this interview with Isaac:

&gt; __HBO: So, the biggest question on our minds: What was your reaction when you found out Bran would become king?__

&gt; __Isaac Hempstead Wright:__ I had to physically get up and walk around my flat. I said, “What?! You’re joking.” It was the very last thing I expected to happen. I was convinced they had sent a script to everyone in which they become king or queen, so I still didn’t believe it until the read-through.

&gt; But I think he is a great character to take on that role. You never thought of him in that way, but what more could you ask for in a king than to have no personal attachments, no agenda, but have a calm understanding of the entire universe? He’s the ideal person to be in charge.

&gt; [Creators] David [Benioff] and Dan [Weiss] told me there were __two things [author] George R.R. Martin had planned for Bran, and that was the Hodor revelation, and that he would be king__. So that’s pretty special to be directly involved in something that is part of George’s vision. It was a really nice way to wrap it up.

Then Elio and Linda made [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50aa3Ahzr9s) to discuss the question of King Bran in more detail as it was apparently coming from GRRM according to this interview. By the way, I added several commentaries in italics.

---

They first question what GRRM might have meant with “Bran will be king” and whether it was Bran as King of Westeros instead of something else. They consider the possibility that GRRM told D&amp;D that Bran would be king beyond the Wall or king on the weirwood throne or king of the children of forest etc. and D&amp;D simplified it in the adaptation by making him the king of Westeros and that information passed on to Isaac. Linda does not find this scenario very likely but Elio still has the feeling that it might be the case.

Then Elio explains what he means. According to him, GRRM might have told D&amp;D that Bran would be king of “something” when D&amp;D visited GRRM at Santa Fe in 2013 and went through every character for a week. Elio points that to be able to discuss King Bran in the books properly; we need to delve into the writing history of ASOIAF and GRRM’s earliest plans. He speculates that Bran as King of Westeros might have initially been in the plans of GRRM at an early point in the writing when he thought “years” would pass within the story.

Linda does not disregard that possibility. Then she repeats the problems from the previous video about the King Bran scenario which were glossed over in the show:

1. How can Bran physically leave the cave in a realistic manner?

1. Being young, crippled, out of the picture for a very long time and having no connections to anyone, how would Bran be accepted as king?

1. Why does Bran agree to or want to be the king of Westeros?

They point that Bran has increasingly fewer chapters in the books (which is why they can forgive the show giving Bran a season off). Elio mentions this strange aspect of the books such that Bran starts as a very prominent POV at the beginning; but in ASoS he gets disconnected from the main story and after that, he has only 3 chapters throughout AFfC and ADwD.

Elio explains some of the details from the writing of ASOIAF. AGoT starts as the first part of a trilogy where initially months can pass within a couple of chapters. But then the action picks up and time gets slower. Failing to finish Act 1 in a single book, GRRM decides to create a new intermediary book. He splits the manuscript and publishes the first part as the AGoT we have, while reserving several hundred MS pages to the newly created book, which is ACoK. After some time he continues the work on ACoK, he hits a massive roadblock. Once again GRRM observes that the momentum of the action does not allow time to pass as fast as he would. This is where he stops all work on ASOIAF and makes detailed structural plans. He creates a new, detailed outline which we have not seen yet. According to this outline, ASOIAF expands to 6 books with a 5 year gap after ASoS. Among other things, this is where they speculate that fake Aegon came into existence. With this new perspective, GRRM does not have much problem in writing ASoS with blazing speed. Then he tries to write the 5 year gap but he can’t make it work. He makes another major revision to his plans and drops the 5 year gap while ASOIAF expands to 7 books in 2001. As a side note, GRRM did not write a single word on Bran throughout 2000-2006 at the very least and perhaps even more years into the writing of ADwD.

Linda raises the point that 5 year gap as an off-screen training montage would work really well for characters like Bran and Arya per GRRM’s own words. But the gap was dropped and there should be serious problems other than the Meereenese Knot that must be causing so much delay in the last few books. Linda wonders whether it is Arya and Bran who are throwing a spanner into GRRM’s plans now for not having the age and training they were supposed to have, to do what they were supposed to do. According to the original plans, we are precisely at the point where Bran and Arya are supposed to do the stuff they were going to do after the 5 year gap. Does GRRM have difficulties in making Arya and Bran do the stuff that he once thought to be done by their 5 year older selves?

Elio considers that possible but he claims that GRRM has accepted that the characters are not going to be as old as he’d initially thought at the end of the story; so, he tried to come up with how to make them work towards the end he wanted, given that they aren't going to be as old and that is the important point. __Bran as king might have been GRRM’s original conception at the beginning but at this point of the writing, he’s moved away from it, or he’s redefined what “king” is for Bran’s endgame.__

In ADwD, Bran meets the three eyed crow on a weirwood throne. Elio speculates that a greenseer king (not of _men_ though) might be the kind of king GRRM has redefined Bran’s role as. As a side note, GRRM created other kinds of kings in TWOIAF, specifically the [Warg King](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Warg_King) and the [First King](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/First_King), which might hold some clues for Bran’s redefined endpoint.

Linda finds in difficult to believe that GRRM would make such a major change but at the same time, she admits that GRRM _did_ change a lot of major things, and introduced new elements like the fake Aegon. On the other hand, if Bran is such a central character to GRRM’s vision for the series, Linda finds it difficult to see GRRM radically changing Bran’s endgame.

Then they talk about prophecies and entertain the idea that prophecies might be more complicated than what most people think. Linda speculates whether Bran might be the third head of the dragon, or Bran might be the Azor Ahai Reborn or one of the three Azor Ahai Reborn figures as Linda’s pick would be Jon, Dany and Bran as three prophesized saviors. As a side note, I have long thought that Bran, Davos and Sam should be three Azor Ahai Reborn figures and Jon should be their Lightbringer.

Then they move onto how GRRM would solve the problems they mentioned earlier about King Bran, starting with the logistics of bringing Bran back. They point that it is very difficult to get to the cave. Maybe a dragon might come and take Bran off but Fire&amp;Blood revealed that dragons might not pass beyond the Wall at all. So, if this kind of thing is to happen, the Wall should have fallen by that time (assuming there is an available dragon that can ferry them back). On his own, can Bran climb to a dragon and can he hold onto it without a saddle (and who will make that saddle)?

---

_Here I disagree with them on the logistics of bringing Bran back. I made a [work on the maps](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9jlyo4/spoilers_extended_movements_beyond_the_wall/) to argue that the cave is not as far north as most readers seem to believe. Jon and Ygritte almost certainly slept in the same cave system, which happens to be real close to the back door of the cave of the children. The wildlings with Jon did not light fire in these caves facing south, for fear of being seen by the watchers on the Wall. Also remember that as Meera noticed at one point while they were going to the cave, Coldhands was leading them through circles for several days. But we know that it was done in order for him to ambush and slay the mutineers from the Craster’s Keep, whose flesh he fed to the party. Neither transportation nor the weather should be a big problem for GRRM. It is not like the weather will continuously be inhospitable for human life throughout winter. The recent snow storm around Winterfell is a rare thing, not the typical Tuesday in the northern winter. Also we should keep in mind that the journey to the cave seemed far more difficult than it should be because Bran-Hodor-Meera-Jojen-Summer-Coldhands was not the ideal ranging party. A group of experienced rangers might cover that distance in less time with fewer difficulties. The only problem is that the cave is besieged by the wights and possibly the Others. But if somehow the ranging party has this intelligence, they might prepare and arm themselves properly. Even without that, the Night’s Watch already knows about dragonglass and they would arm themselves properly for any ranging beyond the Wall. Of course, the return journey is another story. Here, I make use of Gorne’s Way which GRRM introduced in ASoS and expanded in TWOIAF. Delving deep into the caves on the way back allows GRRM to play with the timing of their surfacing up and joining the story where and when GRRM needs them to be. There is nothing in the darkness of the unexplored caves that dictates strict synchronization with other parts of the story and this is a good thing for GRRM._

---

Elio and Linda talk about other ways to bring Bran back. They discuss the Hodor revelation which also comes from GRRM, and whether it might take place at the “back door” of the cave system which we have not seen yet. Linda thinks that it does not necessarily take place there. For some reason, Bran might send Meera-Hodor-Summer south to tell certain people to come to the cave and bring him back. Bran might be in Hodor for most part of this journey and the Hodor thing might happen at the Black Gate of Nightfort. I think this is a logistically sound idea that solves a lot of problems and I can think of many ways to make it work in my TWoW outline. But the greatest question is why Bran will want to leave the cave in the first place, who he will send word to and how he can expect them to agree to help them. Also assuming that Bran sends people, is south the only way?

---

_For example, it is possible to tie this mission to Davos/Skagos storyline. Davos is destined to Skagos to bring Rickon and his direwolf back. If Shaggydog takes a mortal wound while hunting down an enormous unicorn alone (he gets wounded when he brought down a huge one in ADwD), Bran can easily see that and also understands that Davos will have a big problem in his mission. As a result, Bran might decide to send **his** direwolf along with Hodor and Meera so that no one can deny the legitimacy of their claims when they vouch for Davos. The party aims for Eastwatch to find a ship that can carry them to Skagos (assuming Davos is still working on his mission). My guess is that neither the Skagosi nor Osha will find Davos convincing and they will simply put him into jail as it is starting to be a pattern with Davos. He will stay there until Meera arrives and tells them that he is a good man and legit. It is even possible to tie the Hardhome horror into this knot. On the way to Eastwatch, the party comes to Hardhome but the Others have been stalking them since leaving the cave. Thinking that the greenseers must be up to some devious plans, the Others launch their attack to Hardhome prematurely to make sure that the party that had left the cave is slain. Hodor moment might take place at Hardhome at this moment. The Others destroy Hardhome as Mel saw in a vision but the premature attack allows some wildlings to escape the trap and make it to Easwatch through the shores and also through the boats and rafts they have been building as reported in ADwD. At Eastwatch Meera finds a ship destined to Skagos and brings Rickon, Osha and Davos back. Lots of things happen afterwards. Winterfell is liberated and the lords assemble at the Great Hall. They cannot declare Rickon as the Lord of Winterfell because they are all told by Meera that Bran is alive. Lord Manderly promised to join Stannis only when he brought his liege lord back, assuming that Rickon is the one. This is where an experienced and well armed party of rangers are sent to bring Bran back. They will have the motivation and they will know the location. The journey back will probably still take place through Gorne’s Way but this scenario solves a lot of problems in the northern storylines._

---

Next they discuss the problem of how Bran might be accepted as king. They find it very unlikely for Bran to be elected as the king. Elio thinks that an older Bran according to the original plans might have done a lot of visible things to defeat the Others as a “sorcerer lord” and that would have made his campaign for winning the election. But in the story we got, it is very unlikely that Bran would do something that visible in the rest of the story.

They they move onto why Bran would want to be the king in the first place. Linda points that Bloodraven was a kingmaker and he might convince Bran to assume the title. But Elio finds that as a strange thing to have so late into the story. Linda points that this theory relies on side materials (like D&amp;E, TWOIAF etc.) to know Bloodraven and that is not a preferable thing because ASOIAF should be self-reliant and stand on its own. My supporting argument is that the Bloodraven who would do such political manipulations is long dead and the greenseer on that weirwood throne is above such base politics of men. As far as we can see, he is operating on the grandest scheme, and he is only trying to deal with the Others and to do that, he is trying to train Bran before his time is up (and it is implied that his time will be up soon).

Then Elio addresses an important point. We all know that GRRM repeatedly said how he knew the endpoints of major characters since the beginning. One idea is that since the ending is so integral to the overall vision GRRM conceived at the beginning of the saga, he might stick to the ending and completely sideline or ignore structural problems just to have that ending. Elio does not think GRRM would go that far (as in distorting the structure for the sake of the ending he envisioned at the dawn of the story). Elio sees very little in AGoT/ACoK/ASoS that plants the idea of Bran is going to be the king. He knows some early theories for that end but he considers them weak in quotations and structure. AGoT started as the first book of a trilogy but was concluded as the first book of a “four-book trilogy”. ACoK started as the second book of a four-book trilogy but was concluded as the second book of a heptology with ASoS as the third book. In short, one would expect to see a lot of King Bran setup in these first three books because they were meant to cover a lot of space in the overall span of story.

Linda discusses the example of Ned’s death on the subject of subverting expectations. You need to build expectations in the first place and then the subversion should not feel out of the left field in the setting of the story. Ned’s death was shocking to the readers but for an objective eye, it could not have been any different. He was honorable/merciful to a fault, he did not know nor liked the game of thrones and he found himself trapped within the plots of master players. The in-world context is perfectly reasonable for Ned’s shocking death. King Bran might be meant as a shock to the readers but its in-world context should be comparably reasonable.

---

_This is the crux of the matter for the people who have problems with King Bran as it is portrayed in the show. I cannot see how the in-world context might make sense for King Bran in the books. Regardless of what GRRM supposedly said, I personally do not see King Bran happening based on the books I read so far and I refuse to believe that GRRM will build (or is capable of building) a reasonable in-world context for that within the next two books. People who defend King Bran goes by the argument that the current books have the necessary context that makes sense for that end (which I will never agree with) or they simply believe that GRRM will do the necessary setup in the next books (which I refuse to believe before I see those books). I don't care if I am called to be in denial for not buying something that does not currently make sense nor does it seem likely to make sense in the next books._

---

Then Linda explains her “loony theory” that has been teased from the start of the video. It ends up being one of those body snatcher theories. GRRM loves his body snatchers as we know from his other works. The basic premise is to solve all the problems they mentioned before with King Bran (like logistics) and still stick to GRRM’s supposedly original conception of King Bran. Being king but not in his own body works well for the King Bran endgame and that might explain why D&amp;D did not do that in the show. Elio recalls the body snatcher theory with Jon’s body but they dismiss that idea because that does not feel like Jon’s story. The host body in their theory is Euron. Lucky me!

They mention a lot of usual things from the Eldritch Apocalypse stuff but they differ from all that by claiming that Euron’s mind will be destroyed but his body will end up fine just like the vegetable Drogo after the ritual. Euron’s empty shell will be the perfect ride for Bran to actually stay in the cave but be the king of Westeros. 

I am not going to dwell on this theory further. In the rest of the video, they answer questions from fans.",asoiaf
247,"So I was rewatching the show and I got to the scene where Baelish is talking to one of his prostitutes, Ros. He tries to threaten her to become happier by saying this;

Other than the wealth thing which doesn’t fit qyburn, this reminds me a lot of things qyburn did under Cersei.",asoiaf
248,"

My theory is the descendants of the Marsh King still exist in Westeros through the male line. 

We are told by Bran “His son was Rickard Stark, not my father's father but another Rickard, he took the Neck away from the Marsh King and married his daughter.”

We do not what happen to any sons or brothers of the Marsh King or his people. Rather than become vassals of Winterfell or be extinguished like ,House Greenwood, House Towers, House Amber, and House Frost. Relocating and remaining independent, would more attractive than serving their rivals. 

When the Starks drove the Blackwoods from the Wolf’s wood. The Blackwoods relocated to the Riverlands and kept the Old Gods. The same is true for the Manderleys , who kept the seven and the title Order of the Greenhand . Which is a Knightly order founded by House Gardener. The Orphans of the greenblood who fled from Essos , but refused to assimilate to Dornish culture, by retaining their Rhoynish heritage and language.
All being displaced groups. 

So from those examples, we’d be looking for a people that stand out from the crowd. 

The best candidates in my opinion are the Thenns. They wear bronze armour, when most free folk wear furs and leather. The Thenns forge their own helms , axe and spear heads, were as the free folk use stone and wood. With the exception of weapons taken from dead rangers and raided from south of the Wall. 

""Aye, my lady. The Thenns have lords and laws."" They know how to kneel. ""They mine tin and copper for bronze, forge their own arms and armor instead of stealing it. A proud folk, and brave. Mance Rayder had to best the old Magnar thrice before Styr would accept him as King-Beyond-the-Wall.""

Magnar we are told means Lord in old tongue, but also has connections with King. 
Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg is also referred to as King of the Giants.  

Jon . ""It was Mag the Mighty. The king of the giants.""

House Magnar of Kingshouse is a noble house from Kingshouse on the island of Skagos


Thenn is also area beyond the Wall where the Thenns live. 

The most compelling link is George’s love of homophones. 

Reyne/rain/reign/rein 
Dorne/Dawn
Profit/prophet 
Pray/prey
Morning/mourning

250," \*\*sorry if this is a re post, i didnt see this post on asoiaf page the first time i posted it

I just do not buy Bran the King because even if I do not doubt even a little bit that it won't be written well but it doesn't make sense at few levels.

**Firstly, look at Bran's character**

A good King must know his subjects well and must be loved and then will he get the smallfolk's loyalty.

We see this right from book 1, we learn that Ned dines with his family everyday and sometimes brings in one person, usually some worker from the castle, or some other nobleman from the nearby houses and he does this because a ruler needs to show the workers some love and hospitality in return of their work. And this does pay off in the end, Ned's guard and servants proved to be loyal until the very end and tried to protect Ned until their last breath.

And is this trait necessary? Yes, completely. The biggest example in front of us is Stannis and Renly, Stannis is a hard, rigid man who is very capable of being a King, an able military commander and just and yet people flocked to Renly because he used to talk to everyone, again like Ned, used to talk to small folk (in the show) and that's why he had the support of the small folk despite not being the immediate heir and not being a known commander or a leader.

There were 2 Targaryen Kings as well, Aegon III and Aerys I who are hardly remembered because they never paid any special interest in the small folk and were always in their own world.

 **About Bran's army**

Now let's assume that North still decides to be in the part of the Seven Kingdoms for simplicity, yet who will defend Bran when it is really urgent? Look at the War of Five Kings, Ned was imprisoned in King's Landing and Robb called all his bannermen and they even had the Riverlands support and yet he couldn't reach in time. Even in the Dance of Dragons, it was noted that the Northern army took time because the North itself is very huge so assembling takes time and travelling to King's Landing is even harder with 2 other Kingdoms in their way, Riverlands and Vale so who will protect Bran in times of urgency?

**Lastly, about the gods he preaches**

We see from the prologue of ADWD that warging is considered as an abomination and that Varamyr was kicked out of his house because of it and wasn't accepted in the society and these were the Freefolk where everything is allowed and wargs were known and common as well then what about the normal Westerosi people? The wildlings are scorned at because they are known to change skins into animals and all, how would they react to their King who himself does all this actively?

Look at Stannis, another big point which brought him down was for preaching a foreign god, and Bran will do the exact same thing, true there are known to be dozen Houses which follow the Old Gods but for the majority of the South, they are still foreign, the early Targaryens were plagued by the Faith for half a century even though they themselves converted to Faith, then how would the Faith react if their King is of some other religion and does all the abominable things himself?

That is why, I just don't like Bran being the King in the end of the books.

What do you feel?",asoiaf
251," So while GoT prides itself on subversion. The way it beat the Night King plays straight the whole ""kill the central bad guy and the minions lay down and die"" like in the Avengers or the Phantom Menace. My question is how it could have been handled better.  I would have gone with having the heroes have to retreat to Kings Landing, where you have the two opposing factions have two deal with both each other and the looming White Walker hoards ravaging Westeros.  For the finale, the heroes and villains alike would be the killed off, with the main protagonists; particularly Jon and Danaerys giving up their lives to save whatever parts of Westeros they can, and leaving the remnants to attempt to reform Westeros into something better. People justifiably complain about how they handled Danaerys, but I always suspected she might die never taking the throne, her and others sacrificing themselves to save the realm as a whole would have been both a far more valiant end, as well as thematically appropriate with the the thesis that a lot of the kingdoms problems are born from people being more concerned with grabbing and holding power than using it responsibly.",asoiaf
252,"A while ago, I posted a theory which suggesting that the apparent history of infertility, stillbirths, infant deaths and women dying in the birthing bed that seems to have plagued the main branch of House Arryn, was caused by Alyssa's Curse.

&gt;Alyssa Arryn had seen her husband, her brothers, and all her children slain, and yet in life she had never shed a tear. So in death, the gods had decreed that she would know no rest until her weeping watered the black earth of the Vale, where the men she had loved were buried. Alyssa had been dead six thousand years now, and still no drop of the torrent had ever reached the valley floor far below. A Game of Thrones  Catelyn VII


[Original theory](https://old.reddit.com/r/pureasoiaf/comments/74ir9v/noticed_something_else_about_the_vale/) 


TL,DR  The landmarks and layout of the Vale represent male and female reproductive systems - The Bloody Gate's twin watchtowers joined by a covered bridge over the mountain road representing a woman's overies and the fertile Vale representing the womb.

The Giants Lance represents the male with the waterfall known as Alyssa's Tears flowing from the mountain top never reaching(fertilizing) the Vale(womb) below.


The [Extended theory](https://swordsoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2018/08/male-and-female-in-vale-of-arryn.html) goes a lot deeper into the other landmarks like the waycastles, the Eyrie and the Moon Door.

The chapters that take place in the Vale and the Eyrie are some of my favourite and every time i read them  I notice something new that (IMO) adds to this theory. On my latest re-read i was looking at Tyrion's Trial by combat when i noticed something else.

When the champions- Bronn and ser Vardis Egan fight, ser Vardids fights with a sword that Lysa Arryn gave him,

&gt;Ser Vardis held out a gauntleted hand, and his squire placed a handsome double-edged longsword in his grasp. The blade was engraved with a delicate silver tracery of a mountain sky; its pommel was a falcon's head, its crossguard fashioned into the shape of wings. ""I had that sword crafted for Jon in King's Landing,"" Lysa told her guests proudly as they watched Ser Vardis try a practice cut. ""He wore it whenever he sat the Iron Throne in King Robert's place. Isn't it a lovely thing? I thought it only fitting that our champion avenge Jon with his own blade.""
The engraved silver blade was beautiful beyond a doubt, but it seemed to Catelyn that Ser Vardis might have been more comfortable with his own sword. Yet she said nothing; she was weary of futile arguments with her sister. A Game of Thrones  Catelyn VII



The sword is often a phallic symbol and this one is Jon Arryn's sword.


The champions fight below a statue of Alyssa Arryn,

&gt;A bell tolled loudly below them. High lords and serving girls alike broke off what they were doing and moved to the balustrade. Below, two guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks led forth Tyrion Lannister. The Eyrie's plump septon escorted him to the statue in the center of the garden, a weeping woman carved in veined white marble, no doubt meant to be Alyssa.

Bronn is well on the way to beating ser Vardis but Jon Arryn's sword and the statue of Alyssa Arryn play a big part in the knight's death,

&gt;Throwing aside his shield, Ser Vardis lurched after him, using both hands to raise his sword. His right arm was blood from elbow to fingers now, yet his last desperate blow would have opened Bronn from neck to navel … if the sellsword had stood to receive it. But Bronn jerked back. Jon Arryn's beautiful engraved silver sword glanced off the marble elbow of the weeping woman and snapped clean a third of the way up the blade. Bronn put his shoulder into the statue's back. The weathered likeness of Alyssa Arryn tottered and fell with a great crash, and Ser Vardis Egen went down beneath her. Bronn was on him in a heartbeat, kicking what was left of his shattered rondel aside to expose the weak spot between arm and breastplate. Ser Vardis was lying on his side, pinned beneath the broken torso of the weeping woman. Catelyn heard the knight groan as the sellsword lifted his blade with both hands and drove it down and in with all his weight behind it, under the arm and through the ribs. Ser Vardis Egen shuddered and lay still.

Alyssa's curse indeed.",asoiaf
253,"I don't know if I should title this like a discussion or a short essay, but none the less, long post coming with spoilers for EVERYTHING, SHOW AND BOOKS.

And sorry if my grammar is a disaster, my english comes from hours on the internet reading things like the one I'm about to put your through.

Let's get into it.

In the aftermath of the show's finale my mind wandered a lot about how the plot in the books is gonna pan out, and the one thing that I personally haven't saw being discussed is how the winter is going to hit the book plot, based on all we know that has happened and all that's going to happen... Because yes, we know that Bran is going to sit on that ugly chair or the replacement of the Iron Throne after Dany raze the capital, either intentionally or by accident, the ""How's"" and the ""What's"" of this things are not a priority for the moment, because I want to figure out the ""How's"" of how George is going to get there, if that makes sense.

I want to start where the cold is hitting first, North of the Wall, were we assume that the biggest concentrations of people are in one of two places, in Hardhome or down in the Wall with the black brothers, and this second group (that is the less impressive but is the one I'm going to focus on) represents one of the biggest problems that the winter is going to present to our charaters, the refugees...

The situation at Castle Black is dire, the cultural gap the animosity between both sides of the Wall that has been brewing for centurys and the shortage of food and space explodes into the riot that puts an end to the Lord Commander's short life and his rule over the Night's Watch, figure that tried to close this gap and brought the widlings into the realm. All of this is a really important factor because I count that this refugee crisis is going to replicate south with the advance of the cold on the major Castles, and I'm leaving the Others outside this equation for now because down south, on of the major issues for this conflict is absent, there is no breach between the peoples of the north...

The rulers are going to struggle to stock up on supplys, the crops are going to gi yield less or completely fail and receiving goods is going to be hard when the road dissapear under the snows or worse, the horses and the man die on it, we are already seeing this in Stannis's camp. Later they will have to deal with all the people that can reach their castles or let them die outside their walls, the ones that doesn't die will continue further south. This coupled with the Battle at Winterfell that involves some of the major military powers in the North, makes me think that they will not withstand the coming of the the Others. It would be very hard to maintain control over their territory because travelling is already hard now in the books and I don't think that the sacrifice of a little child is going to stop that

Hardhome is a complete riddle to me right now, the short message sent to Jon makes me think that, unlike the show, the water and the coastlines of Westeros are not going to be so safe from the wights, that includes the Iron Islands, Bear Isle and Skagos, that maybe means something for Davos and Rickon's posse.

I think I should stop right here for now, because the refugee train is going down south babe! The is if they can go through the Neck that is, and because in the South the problem is going to be related to the economy in this winter and I would need more time to get that into paper.

255," So in the show Varys says ""... who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was."". But what was wrong with Roberts reign? He has said multiple times that he serves the realm and his true allegiance is to the smallfolk, but how did Robert's reign hurt them at all? Sure the crown was in a massive amount of debt and most of it was from Roberts vassal Tywin, so there wasn't a huge risk of war over it. The realm was at peace and the people were safe, so why would he try to restore the Targaryens? The last Targaryen king went crazy and started burning people alive which eventually lead to Roberts Rebellion, which was an incredibly destructive war and hurt the smallfolk a lot. Why would Varys risk having another Targaryen ruler? He also knew that the WotFKs was imminent from his discussion with Illyrio. But did nothing to stop it even with it being very destructive to the smallfolk. He also tried to bring Khal Drogo's khallasar to Westeros to back Viserys's claim to the throne. Wouldn't 40k dothraki riders be insanely destructive to the country? They would rape and pillage anyone not behind a stone wall as Robert said in season one.

256,"I've always been a proponent of rereads because it allows you to catch more things that you haven't read AND comprehended on the first time through.

In this post, I'm specifically referring to Meleys and Vhagar. If you recall in Fire and Blood, the relationship between Baelon and Alyssa was probably the most passionate and love filled of most of the targaryans that I've come across. Their relationship also had the least amount of unnatural difficulties. If not for Alyssa's ultimate death, I think they would have been as close and passionate about one another as Jaehaerys and Alysanne.

One of Alyssa's favorite passtimes was riding, first, her spring prince, second her dragon Meleys. The archmaesters make mention that Baelon and Alyssa often went flying together. I presume that during their flying they would land in odd places around westeros spending time together. Their dragons would spend time together as well. Baelon mounting none other than the nightly Vhagar. I always thought of the intelligence of the dragons as something more than dogs but not quite enough to truly articulate their feelings with tongue. This mainly comes from only accepting one rider, emoting similar to their masters even when they're not present, and knowing one another (silverwings reaction to vermithors death).

It wasnt until the third read through that I realized what takes place at rooks rest. Sure I understand that Vhagar was ridden by Aemond while Meleys was ridden by Rhaenys. Imagine that these two, having flown together and spent time together, know one another and are being commanded by their riders to kill one another. I don't know. It just resonates with me that two magnificent beast who had such wondering history together, end up on opposite sides of a fight. And I'm willing to bet that based on the description of the fight, Melys tore into Sunfire and Vhagar tore Meleys to shreds.

When I woke up, I remembered how we dispatched of the Mountain. Clearly he cannot be poisoned, killed by normal means, or even slightly deterred without the sacrifice of men. However the show tells us how he met his end by falling from a castle into a fire, via the Hound. 

My proposal:
Instead of Sandor kamikaze-ing himself, we contract about twenty Dothraki screamers to lasso the Mountain and drag him off a cliff into a fiery inferno. 
The Mountain can't do anything at range, and this leaves plenty of room for error if one of the Dothraki fail.

Obviously secrets, misinformation, and simply the pace that news travels at is a big part of the story, but this is focusing on characters simply knowing about their world. When characters have limited knowledge about the world, it makes the world feel bigger.

The first time I noticed this was on my second read, as Catelyn approaches the Eyrie with Tyrion as her prisoner:

&gt;When her uncle saw that she had stopped, he moved his horse closer and pointed. ""It's there, beside Alyssa's Tears. All you can see from here is a flash of white every now and then, if you look hard and the sun hits the walls just right.""

&gt;Seven towers, Ned had told her, like white daggers thrust into the belly of the sky, so high you can stand on the parapets and look down on the clouds. ""How long a ride?"" she asked.

Catelyn had never seen the Eyrie before this moment, only knowing a description of it from Ned. But why does this matter? Partly, it's a convenient mechanism for a writer. A character who doesn't know something serves as an excuse to have information presented. A character returning to a place they see all the time doesn't spend time drinking in the details -- try to remember your last commute to work. A character who can see thing fresh or ask questions is as much a staple in writing as are paragraph breaks and full stops; even more true in fantasy and scifi. But, that'd delivering the world to the reader; I believe these moments of ignorance are actually part of the actual world building.

**Bricks and Mortar**

Catelyn remembering Ned describing the Eyrie is such a minor detail, but it's these minor things, one stacked on top of the next, that build the World of Ice and Fire.  Some details are the bricks in the structure GRRM is creating, but I think these moments of characters not knowing everything about their world are more like the mortar holding the bricks together.

Part of world building is coming up with lots of cool ideas, lightsabers, face dancers, giant eagles, and flying broom sports. But, part of it is also making that world feel real and lived in. In the real world, people don't have encyclopedic knowledge. Unless you're from a one stoplight town or are a taxi driver in London, you don't even know all the streets in the city where you live. Having varying bodies of knowledge among the characters makes the world feel big and rich, and its inhabitants feel real.

We get these details-of-ignorance all throughout the series. Arya doesn't know how far the God's Eye is from Riverrun. Black Lorren doesn't know what the Dothraki are. Brynden the Blackfish is shocked to learn just what Moat Cailin looks like. The rather well traveled Jorah Mormont knows there's cities to the East of the Red Waste, but not what they are or how far away. It's possible that there's no person in Westeros outside of the Citadel that knows the Dosh Khaleen exist.

The more people don't know things (when they're not mere idiots) the more we're reminded just how much there is to know. If it feels like most of the characters have seen the world, then it won't feel like a very big world.

265,"I often read posts where people say they are rereading the books and their opinion of a character has changed. Tyrion seems less good and more self-pitying, or they have more patience for Sansa, or they are more concerned about character X. To what degree do you think this is caused by GRRM writing POVs that somewhat mislead the audience's judgement versus this is an effect of later character development?

A classic example of this question is Dany. I have read posts arguing that while Dany has wonderful moments of compassion, she's already pretty ruthless and throne obsessed even in the first novel. Other posts argue just as strongly that Dany's dark twist came out of nowhere.  How much of dark Dany in future books will be the result of Dany's character changing and how much is a result of GRRM showing how she appears through other points of views? In other words, if you had more POVs around Dany, would readers already be more concerned?

I don't think POV vs. character arc is a binary choice. Obviously characters will develop and change and the reader's perspective will also change as the reader gets more information about the situation and the world.

Sam presented Archmaester Ebrose's *A Song of Ice and Fire* which chronicles the wars and events that followed the death of King Robert Baratheon.

Of course in groan inducing fashion, D&amp;D get one last gut-buster in as we learn that Archmaester Ebrose makes no mention of Tyrion Lannister  throughout his comprehensive treatment of ""modern"" history.

As a joke it was shit

In-universe, it turns *A Song of Ice and Fire* into the Where’s Waldo of historical scholarship. 

Despite a plethora of contemporary sources, documents and only detailing events that have all happened within the last few years the omission of Tyrion Lannister means Archmaester Ebrose's work is critically incompetent.

When you remove Tyrion Lannister from the work and events it covers it raises questions like:

- Who designed the Handicapable saddle for King Bran the Broken?
- Who did Catelyn Stark take prisoner to the Eyrie?
- Who did Lysa Arryn &amp; Lord Robin Arryn imprison and hold a trial by combat for?
- **Why did Ser Gregor Clegane start raiding the Riverlands?** 
- Why did Ser Jaime Lannister break Ned Stark's leg and kill his house guards?
- Why were the forces of the Westerlands mobilized for war immediately after the death of King Robert Baratheon?
- Who brought the Mountain Clans of the Vale into the Westerlands forces?
- **Who brought Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, current Master of Coin &amp; Lord of Highgarden, into Kings Landing and Court?**	
- Who sent Myrcella to Dorne?
- **Who was King Joffrey ~~Baratheon~~ Lannister's Hand before Lord Tywin?**
- Who prepared the defense of King's Landing against Lord Stannis Baratheon?
- **Who devised the Wildfire plan during the Battle of the Black Water?**
- Who married Queen of the North Sansa Stark when she was a hostage in Kings Landing?
- **Who was accused of the regicide of King Joffrey ~~Baratheon~~ Lannister?**
- **Who was put on trial for the regicide of King Joffrey ~~Baratheon~~ Lannister?**
- **Who was important enough for Prince Oberyn of Dorne to be Champion for in a Trial by Combat for the Regicide of King Joffrey?**
- **Who Killed Tywin Lannister?**
- Who was Dany Targaryen's chief adviser?
- Who thought up the Wights Moot?
- Who let the Kingslayer go?
- Who suggested the radical changes to how kings are chosen?
- **Who nominated King Bran the Broken?**

Fact is, omitting Tyrion from the events of recent history is impossible because he shows up a lot and does a number of things that are important or have significant consequences? 

I imagine reading the Game of Thrones version of *A Song of Ice and Fire* would be annoying as fuck with the obvious gaps in information indicating that there are figures missing from the work

And here's why this shitty sitcom joke is unintentionally brilliant . 

**D&amp;D presented us A Song of Ice and Fire that has most of the big events, pivotal moments and gets general gist right but sacrifices some essential bits for a cheap payoff**

Intentional or not (Definitely not), that single shit joke summarizes the core differences between HBO's Game of Thrones and GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire. From every problem and flaw we see with the show, it all comes down to D&amp;D sacrificing depth, nuance, consistent and coherent character development, writing, themes in exchange for a quick razzle dazzle spectacle. 

**Even their own in-universe version of *A Song of Ice and Fire* is a reflection of their approach to the show and deviation from GRRM.**",asoiaf

# 4- Dark, dark were the tunnels

&amp;#x200B;

Note : All quotes in this section are taken from the short story.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« If anything survived, it was underground. That’s where we should look. » 

	

Dark, Dark were the tunnels is the title of a short story written by GRRM in 1971, in which he tells about Greel, a scout on a mission for the People. 

It is a creature of vaguely human form, small, barely over four feet tall, with large pale eyes. Armed with his spear, he explores the narrow, dark tunnels below the Earth's surface, dreaming that taletellers would sing of his future heroic achievements. Greel has a mental brother, a great blind rat who has been with him since birth, and whom he can control to hear and feel through him. 

Yes, the members of the People have powers. They can mingle their minds with those of other living beings. Yet, despite appearances, they are humans.

Indeed, very quickly the reader understands that several centuries ago, a cataclysmic event caused humans to disappear from the Earth's surface, and separated the survivors into two groups.

The first ones left the planet and witnessed the events from a long distance, without being affected. 

The latter must have hide into the depths of the Earth, where they returned to a primitive stage and survived under extreme conditions.... Finally, only the best adapted ones survived. Thus, slowly, the human species has evolved physically, adapting to this new environment. Their size and build have decreased due to the small size of the tunnels. Deprived of light, their eyes developed, and their skin paled. 

The short story tells **the encounter between the People and the first men** to return to Earth. 

Will they be able to see beyond appearances and understand that they are not so different?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sci-fi short story or fantasy novel, if the genre is different, the main themes developed by GRRM in both stories are essentially the same.

Here are a few examples.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« The tunnels. The dark. For long centuries only the dark. »

&amp;#x200B;

What would happen to mankind if it were plunged into darkness? A theme that inevitably evokes the Long Night, and which has obviously fascinated GRRM for a long time. 

Here he gives an ambiguous answer to this question, by contrasting a return to the primitive state and a real psychological evolution of our species. For the members of the People, normal humans are lower animals with crippled minds. 

We find this same dynamic in ASOIAF, the CotF seeing humans as... children!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« Don’t you understand? This is old. It’s history. It’s the remains of a civilization and a nation and a planet that perished. »

&amp;#x200B;

The apocalypse is both the main theme and the issue of the short story: civilizations have disappeared, and the human species is threatened with extinction.

The concept of the apocalypse, an event that destroys an entire civilization by its scale, is a recurring theme in ASOIAF. We immediately think of the Doom of Valyria, as well as all the places that seem to bear the traces of past cataclysms, but also of all these even older and more mysterious ruins, which seem to be the traces of disappeared civilizations. 

The central point of the story itself, the arrival of the Others, inscribed in the prologue to the very first novel, immediately raises the issue : it is the human species that is in danger of disappearing.

In reality, what interests GRRM is not so much the apocalypse itself as what happens to the survivors and their descendants, including several centuries or thousands of years later... or even more.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« Man must meet man. » 

&amp;#x200B;

The encounter of two very different worlds, which go to war despite the greater threat they face, and which risk disappearing together if they do not succeed in allying... Does that recall something ? 

What would happen if today's humans met their very distant descendants? Could they understand each other? This is the big question this short story raises, and it is the one we are discussing here, because GRRM is asking it again in ASOIAF, without revealing this time the origin of the mysterious people with whom humans are confronted.

	

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« He concentrated on the scent. It was strange, unlike anything he had encountered before. But somehow it felt like a man-scent, though it could not be that. »

&amp;#x200B;

In a few pages, GRRM was already addressing many of his favourite themes in 1971. I do not reveal any more, but this short story also tells about  ice and fire, light and darkness, survival and madness, desire and duty, impregnation and death, and, of course, inbreeding.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« - Down here, in these tunnels, are the answers we’re seeking.   
&gt;  
&gt;\- That’s *your* theory, anyway. »

&amp;#x200B;

All this to say that it is not impossible that GRRM, fascinated by the same themes for a long time, may take up some of its old stories and tell them again, but in another form, in another setting, by turning certain concepts upside down, playing with them and making them more complex... 

He may have draw inspiration from the People of Greel to create the CotF.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Selected short quotes from Dark, Dark were the tunnels :

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« Greel was a strong mind-mingler. He knew the coarse, dim feel of an animal’s mind, the obscene shadows that were the thoughts of the worm-things. And he knew the minds of men. »  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;« He doesn’t realize how deep the cities had dug before the war. There are miles of tunnels under our feet. Level after level. That’s where the survivors would be, if there are any survivors. »

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« Greel thought. An almost man-scent. And words. Could it be that the fire things were men? They would be strange men, much unlike the People. But the taletellers sung of men in ancient times that had strange powers and forms. Might not these be such men? Here, in the Oldest Tunnels, where the legends said the Old Ones had created the People - might not such men still dwell here? »

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« The People fought back. Mind-minglers could sense the worm-things, and spears could slay them, and the great hunting rats could rip them to shreds. But always the worm-things fled back into the earth itself. And there were many worm-things, and few People. »

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« Through him Greel watched : watched with the rat’s ears and with his nose.   
&gt;  
&gt;The fire was talking. »

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; « They were men. Men like the Old Ones. They would help the People against the worm-things. A new age would dawn. »

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# General conclusion 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« The child smiled. ""Men, they are the children."" »  
&gt;  
&gt;ADWD - Bran II

	

What really defines the CotF is their humanity.  Their smiles. Their sadness....

They *are* humans. Their appearance is only a consequence of their history. 

&amp;#x200B;

How does this twist serve the story ? Of course, it is a matter of playing with our expectations to surprise us. The author has done everything possible to ensure that, upon discovering the CotF, the reader immediately imagines supernatural beings, creatures such as wood elves or pixies, or nature spirits. But to say that GRRM plays with tropes has become a trope in itself.  

&amp;#x200B;

If the author preferred to imagine another Humanity, it is to put ours in perspective. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the protagonists, the CotF are part of a vanished world. Yet, from our perspective as readers, they could be our descendants. Our children's children's children.

This is GRRM's tour de force: to present, through beings of the past, a future for Mankind.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, the theme of the story is not simply an allegory of the opposition between man and nature, this great classic of fantasy literature that everyone expects. 

The real point of the encounter between the CotF and the First Men is mankind in conflict with itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

The human being, in all its forms and complexity, is truly at the heart of ASOIAF.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, GRRM could have directly revealed the nature and the origin of the CotF, but he only gives us enough clues to understand by ourselves. However, it is all about making it a secret and not revealing it to the reader. Thus he questions us on wether or not we are able to see humanity inside strangeness.

	

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for having taken the time to read this text !

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

One last thing: unlike humans, who have forgotten where they come from, the CotF know the secret of their origins...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« I am only a boy who dreams. The greenseers were more than that. They were wargs as well, and the greatest of them could wear the skins of any beast that flies or swims or crawls, and could look through the eyes of the weirwoods as well, and see the truth that lies beneath the world. »

&gt;  
&gt;ADWD - Bran II

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« The way the shadows shifted made it seem as if the walls were moving too. Bran saw great white snakes slithering in and out of the earth around him, and his heart thumped in fear. He wondered if they had blundered into a nest of milk snakes or giant grave worms, soft and pale and squishy. Grave worms have teeth. »

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« Under the hill they still had food to eat. A hundred kinds of mushrooms grew down here. Blind white fish swam in the black river, but they tasted just as good as fish with eyes once you cooked them up. They had cheese and milk from the goats that shared the caves with the singers, even some oats and barleycorn and dried fruit laid by during the long summer. And almost every day they ate blood stew, thickened with barley and onions and chunks of meat. Jojen thought it might be squirrel meat, and Meera said that it was rat. Bran did not care. It was meat and it was good. The stewing made it tender. »

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« The great cavern that opened on the abyss was as black as pitch, black as tar, blacker than the feathers of a crow.

&gt;	Arya rolled headfirst into the tunnel and dropped five feet. She got dirt in her mouth but she didn't care, the taste was fine, the taste was mud and water and worms and life. Under the earth the air was cool and dark. Above was nothing but blood and roaring red and choking smoke and the screams of dying horses. She moved her belt around so Needle would not be in her way, and began to crawl. A dozen feet down the tunnel she heard the sound, like the roar of some monstrous beast, and a cloud of hot smoke and black dust came billowing up behind her, smelling of hell. Arya held her breath and kissed the mud on the floor of the tunnel and cried. For whom, she could not say. »

&gt;	« The ashes fell like a soft grey snow.  
&gt;  
&gt;	Beyond the open fields he could see the great piles of man-rock stark against the swirling flames. The wind blew hot and rich with the smell of blood and burnt meat, so strong he began to slaver.  
&gt;  
&gt;	He sniffed at the drifting smoke. *Men, many men, many horses, and fire, fire, fire.* No smell was more dangerous. The smoke and ash clouded his eyes, and in the sky he saw a great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame. Behind the cliffs tall fires were eating up the stars.  
&gt;  
&gt;	All through the night the fires crackled, and once there was a great roar and a crash that made the earth jump under his feet. Dogs barked and whined and horses screamed in terror. Howls shuddered through the night; the howls of the man-pack, wails of fear and wild shouts, laughter and screams.  
&gt;  
&gt;	The dark place was pulling at him by then, the house of whispers where all men were blind. He could feel its cold fingers on him. The stony smell of it was a whisper up the nose. He struggled against the pull. He did not like the darkness. He was wolf. He was hunter and stalker and slayer, and he belonged with his brothers and sisters in the deep woods, running free beneath a starry sky. He sat on his haunches, raised his head, and howled. *I will not go*, he cried. *I am wolf, I will not go*. Yet even so the darkness thickened, until it covered his eyes and filled his nose and stopped his ears, so he could not see or smell or hear or run, and all was black and still and black and cold and black and dead and black…  
&gt;  
&gt;	“*Bran*,” a voice was whispering softly. “*Bran, come back. Come back now, Bran. Bran…*”  
&gt;  
&gt;	He closed his third eye and opened the other two, the old two, the blind two. In the dark place all men were blind. But someone was holding him. He could feel arms around him, the warmth of a body snuggled close. He could hear Hodor singing. »

# To go further:

&amp;#x200B;

As we have mentioned, humans have been confronted with CotF wherever they were present. And of course, the intermixing is not limited to the Neck, Naath and Leng. In reality, it is a *global* phenomenon. In other words, many humans have CotF among their distant ancestors. 

&amp;#x200B;

Traces of these intermixings can be found in many regions : almost everywhere in Westeros but also in Braavos, for example. 

	

In myths and legends :

\- The Warg King was a human being allied to the CotF. The Starks would have killed his sons and kept his daughters. 

\- Artys Arryn, the Winged Knight, is a legendary character whose wife, a CotF, died in childbirth. Its history blends and merges with that of Ser Artys Arryn, the Winged Knight, founder of the Arryn house and Robert Arryn's distant ancestor.

	

In secondary characters :

\- Jenny of Oldstones

\- Dick Crabbe

\- Elaena Targaryen

\- Mya Stone

	

In more important characters :

\- Tywin Lannister has green eyes flecked with gold, like the Naathis. Could the Lannisters have CotF among their ancestors ? Well, there are those stories about Lann the Clever...

\- Melisandre, her terrifying beauty, her grace, her slender and fine body, her red hair, her red eyes, her musical voice, her powers, her longevity... Reading back her description and that of Leaf can be very interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

These are just a few examples, there are many more!

The ASOIAF world is filled with dozens of different peoples and species. The Children of the Forest stand out for their ancestrality, appearance and powers. **What are they, exactly? Where do they come from? When and how did they appear?**

This mystery is built by George RR Martin as a game of hints and deductions. To solve it, we will investigate in the four corners of the known world, from the Neck to Leng, from Ib to Naath... and other even more mysterious places.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to discover the origin of the CotF, we must understand their nature. Morphology, physiology, reproduction, genetics, evolution, culture, lifestyle, society, environment... We will study in detail all their characteristics as a species.

First of all, let us recall what defines a species:

&amp;#x200B;

« A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which any two individuals of the appropriate sexes can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. »

&amp;#x200B;

Why would this definition be valid in the context of the fictional and fantastic world of ASOIAF? After all, what the author shows us are supernatural beings. It's magic, says GRRM.

But we, attentive readers, can see the mice moving in his sleeve. Big mice, hirsutes and taciturn....

&amp;#x200B;

Magic has its place in ASOIAF, but it is not always where we expect it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# 1- The Ibbenese case

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The first step of our long journey is in the Shivering Sea. The Ibbenese are an ancient people of islanders from the north of Essos. TWOIAF gives an extremely precise description of their morphological type.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« The Ibbenese stand apart from the rest of mankind. They are a heavy people, broad about the chest and shoulders, but seldom standing more than five and a half feet in height, with thick, short legs and long arms. Though short and squat, they are ferociously strong; at wrestling, their favorite sport, no man can hope to equal them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Their faces, characterized by sloping brows with heavy ridges, small sunken eyes, great square teeth, and massive jaws, seem brutish and ugly, an impression heightened by their guttural, grunting tongue. They are the most hirsute people in the known world. Though their flesh is pale, with dark blue veins beneath the skin, their hair is dark and wiry. Ibbenese men are heavily bearded; wiry body hair covers their arms, legs, chests, and backs. Coarse dark hair is common amongst their women, even on the upper lip. »

&amp;#x200B;

But above all, the text contains essential information about these people, of a biological nature.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**« Though the men of Ib can father children upon the women of Westeros and other lands, the products of such unions are often malformed and inevitably sterile, in the manner of mules. Ibbenese females, when mated with men from other races, bring forth naught but stillbirths and monstrosities. »**

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, this excerpt describes hybridization by interspecific crossing, a barbaric term if ever there was one. This is not to be confused with intraspecific crossing, as between two dogs of different breeds.

Here we are talking about reproduction between two distinct species, such as a horse and a donkey, a lion and a tiger, a camel and a lama.... These crosses have the particularity of producing individuals that are generally not very fertile or even sterile.

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, note the detail: the text specifies that there is a structural difference between the product of a union between an Ibbenese male and a human female (viable but sterile) and that of a union between an Ibbenese female and a human male (non-viable).

And the comparison with mules in the text is not innocent. Mules are sterile hybrids produced by a donkey and a mare. On the other hand, the mating of a stallion and a female donkey produces a different hybrid, the hinny, which is also sterile.

**This exerpt reveals that the definition of species is valid in the world of ASOIAF, and that humans and Ibenese are as genetically different as horses and donkeys are.**  This will not surprise anyone, as GRRM pays great attention to genetic considerations in general. It is known.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, although the Ibbenians resemble humans in the sense that they are intelligent primates who have developed a civilization, biologically speaking the two groups do not belong to the same species.

It is easy to imagine that the author had fun creating a world in which, in different places, different primates experienced a similar evolution and gave humans on one side, the Ibenians on another, etc....

Perhaps there is another explanation, but it is conceivable at least from the point of view of the complexity of the world created by GRRM ; whose fauna includes, as a reminder, all kinds of species inspired by our prehistory, mammoths and other ""walking lizards""...

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's get to the heart of the matter, and get interested in the CotF.

# 2 - Nature of the Children of the Forest

&amp;#x200B;

We have seen that, in the ASOIAF world, the question of the nature of species arises in terms of biology.

&amp;#x200B;

**The external appearance of the Ibbenians was only an indication of their true nature. Genetics provides the definitive proof, and reproduction is the determining criterion.**

&amp;#x200B;

Then let's repeat the exercise with the CotF. But this time it is a question of examining in detail everything we know about them.

Let us observe them very carefully, and above all, let us not stop at appearances.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« The Children are as **small** as children, but they are not childlike. They are **dark** and **beautiful** ; **slight**, **quick**, and **graceful**. They may live for centuries.  
&gt;  
&gt;They have **nut-brown skin, dappled like a deer's** with paler spots. Their hands have only **three fingers and a thumb**, with sharp black **claws** instead of nails. They have **large ears** that can hear things that no man can hear. They usually have **large gold and green eyes** slitted like those of a cat, allowing them to **see in dark** passages.  
&gt;  
&gt;Very rarely, one of the children is born with **mossy green or blood red eyes**, a sign that he have greensight.  
&gt;  
&gt;They were the first inhabitants of Westeros with the giants. They could once be found from the Lands of Always Winter to the shores of the Summer Sea.  
&gt;  
&gt;They lived in a crude manner. They worked no metal, but they had **great art in working obsidian** to make tools and weapons. They wove no cloths but were skilled in making garments of leaves and bark. They weave leaves and vines and flowers into their hair, and wear cloaks of leaves. They learned to make **bows** of weirwood and to construct flying **snares** of grass, and both of the sexes hunted with these.  
&gt;  
&gt;They resided in the **woods**, in **crannogs**, in **bogs** and **marshes**, and even in **caverns** and **hollow hills**. It is said that, in the woods, they made **shelters of leaves and withes** up in the branches of trees.  
&gt;  
&gt;They call themselves *those who sing the song of earth*, the giants call them *little squirrel people*.  
&gt;  
&gt;They often sing, and their **song** and **music** were said to be as **beautiful** as they were.  
&gt;  
&gt;The gods they worshipped were the innumerable **gods of the streams and forests and stones**.  
&gt;  
&gt;It was the children who **carved** the weirwoods with faces.  
&gt;  
&gt;They were led by their wise men, the greenseers, whose **powers** enabled them to see through the eyes of the carved weirwoods, see events at a great distance, communicate across half a realm, delve into the past and see far into the future.  
&gt;  
&gt;The **skinchangers** communicated with beasts, and could control them by having their spirits mingle.  
&gt;  
&gt;The **hunters** among the Children became their **warriors** as First Men invaded their territory. »

&amp;#x200B;

It should be remembered that the CotF were also present in Essos, which is not surprising because this continent was once connected to Westeros.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« The land of Ifequevron is a huge swathe of northern Essos, a **densely wooded** region that had formerly been the home of a **small**, **shy forest folk**, that Dothraki called *those who walk in the woods*. Some say that the Ibbenese extinguished this gentle race, whilst others believe they went into hiding in the deeper woods or fled to other lands.  
&gt;  
&gt;Corlys Velaryon visited these woods, he wrote of **carved trees**, haunted **grottoes**, and **strange silences**. The little people blessed a household that left offerings of **leaf and stone and water** overnight.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Dothraki had shunned those forests; some say this was because of their reverence for the vanished wood walkers, others because they feared their **powers**. »

&amp;#x200B;

Note the strange *silences*, which refer to the music and songs of the CotF. A poetic way of identifying them by their absence.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, we are dealing with an ancient and primitive people, living in harmony with nature. We remember the CotF for their skill, their music, their craftsmanship, their powers...

And their very strange eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

Eye colour and size are particularly interesting, as they are very important in general in ASOIAF. Members of the same family often have similar eyes. Sometimes the eyes can reveal a character's secret identity. Here they will interest us especially as a hereditary genetic trait.

The description of the Forest Children may suggest that they are a species in their own right, but the reproduction data is missing to confirm or disprove this.

&amp;#x200B;

**However, if we could demonstrate that CotF and humans can produce viable and fertile offspring, we could conclude that, unlike the Ibbenian case, these two groups constitute a single species.**

&amp;#x200B;

There is no formal proof of this, but strong clues suggesting that humans and CotFs can indeed have children, and that they themselves can generate offspring. Everyone will form an intimate conviction after examining the facts.

&amp;#x200B;

These clues includes human groups that seem to share certain very particular characteristics with the CotF.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's follow the CotF trail where they lived, because they left their mark.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# The mixed peoples

&amp;#x200B;

Terminology note: For simplicity, *mixed people* and *intermixing* will refer to the mixing of two populations, in genetic and cultural terms.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If, in the past, humans and CotF interbred, their descendants must have hereditary genetic traits. And it is !

&amp;#x200B;

We will observe three peoples, and see that they share with the CotF many morphological, physiological, and cultural characteristic.

The latter are not evidence in themselves, but they are interesting to note because, when added to the other characteristics, they become an additional clue of population mixing.

&amp;#x200B;

**The idea is that human populations have lived in contact with the CotF, that crossbreeding has taken place, and that these peoples are its descendants.**

&amp;#x200B;

First let us give an overview of these three peoples.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Crannogmen

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start with the most famous of these three peoples, from which Meera and Jojen Reed come.

&gt;« The crannogmen are a **reclusive people** who dwell in the  Neck, a land covered in **swamp** and **bog**, **infested** with quicksand, lizard-lions, snakes and poisonous plants. The histories say that the crannogmen grew close to the Children of the Forest.  
&gt;  
&gt;They live in **houses of thatch and woven reeds**. wield **nets** and use poisonned **arrows**. They are talented **hunters** and **warriors**. Despite their **slight stature** and somewhat primitive lifestyle, they have proven a notoriously **difficult people to conquer**.  
&gt;  
&gt;They saw their kings as the first among equals, who were often thought to be touched by the **old gods**—a fact that show itself in **eyes of strange hues** (like Jojen Reed's **unusually deep mossy green eyes**), or even in **speaking with animals**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some claim the Crannogmen's **small stature** results from inadequate nourishment, other say it is because they **intermarried** with the Children of the Forest. »

The last sentence, although speculative, is full of meaning. Not only is this a formal reference in the text to possible crossbreeding, but it emphasizes a genetic consideration: the transmission of hereditary traits ; and even suggests the evolution of a human group as a result of this transmission.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Naathis

&amp;#x200B;

Let's continue with the people from which Missandei comes.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« In the Summer Sea lies the mysterious island of Naath, known to the ancients as the Isle of Butterflies, which inland is made of **hills** and **forests**.  
&gt;  
&gt;The people native to the island have round flat faces, **dusky skin**, and **large**, **soft amber eyes, oft flecked with gold**. They are as **clever** as they are **gentle**, **fair to look upon**, and quick to learn obedience.  
&gt;  
&gt;The **Peaceful** People, the Naathi are called, for they will not fight even in defense of their homes and persons. They do not kill, not even beasts of the field and wood; they eat fruit, not flesh, and make **music**, not war. Their **fine handicrafts**, shimmering silks, and delicate spiced wines are exported to a large number of countries. The god of Naath is called the Lord of **Harmony**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Whilst the docile nature of the Naathi seem to make their island ripe for conquest, strangers do not live long upon the Isle of Butterflies. Yet **none of these invaders survived**, and the native claim that none lasted more than a year, for some evil humor lurks in the very air of this fair isle, and all those who linger too long on Naath soon succumb. The Naathi themselves are seemingly untroubled by the illness. Some believe that it is spread by the butterflies. »

&amp;#x200B;

# The Lengiis

&amp;#x200B;

The second part of our journey ends in an even more exotic and mysterious land.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« The verdant isle of Leng, which history goes back very far, surrounded by the waters of the Jade Sea.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are queer ruins in the depths of the island's **jungle**: massive buildings, long fallen, and so overgrown that rubble remains above the surface...but underground, **endless labyrinths of tunnels** lead to **vast chambers**, and carved steps descend hundreds of feet into the earth.  
&gt;  
&gt;The native Lengii are perhaps the tallest of all the known races of mankind, with many men amongst them reaching seven feet in height, and some as tall as eight. Long-legged and **slender**, with **flesh the color of oiled teak**, they have **large golden eyes** and can supposedly **see farther and better** than other men, especially **at night**. Though formidably tall, the women of the Lengii are famously **lithe** and **lovely**, of **surpassing beauty**.  
&gt;  
&gt;For much of its history, Leng has been an isle of mystery, for the native Lengii seldom sailed beyond sight of their own shores, and such seafarers who chanced to glimpse their coasts met a **cold reception** should they dare to come ashore. The Lengii had no interest in foreign gods, foreign goods, foreign food or dress or customs; nor did they allow outsiders to mine their gold, harvest their trees, gather their fruit, or fish their seas. Those who attemped to do so met a swift and bloody end. Leng became known as a haunt of demons and sorcerers, **a place to be avoided**, a closed island.  
&gt;  
&gt;The great apes of Leng are also farfamed; amongst them are spotted humpback apes said to be almost as clever as men, and hooded apes as large as giants, so strong that they can pull the arms and legs off a man as easily as a boy might pull the wings off a fly. »

&amp;#x200B;

# Evidences about intermixing

Let us examine in detail the characteristics of these peoples which are clues of intermixing between humans and CotF.

&amp;#x200B;

# Environment

&amp;#x200B;

Their environment (marshes and bogs, forests and hills, jungle and caves), typical of the kind of environment that the CotF like, indicates that they may have been present on these territories in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

The existence of caves and tunnels is not mentioned about Naath and the Neck. In fact, if there are any on Naath, we have no way of knowing, since no stranger has stayed on the island long enough to explore it in depth. As for the underground passages of the Neck, they are certainly flooded (see the particular history of this region).

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, it should be noted that these regions are singularly isolated, an essential feature from an evolutionary point of view. Indeed, these three peoples have in common that they live in an environment cut off from the outside world for several reasons :

\- or by its geography in the case of Naath and Leng islands ;

\- or by the hostility of nature ;

\- or by the fierce nature of its inhabitants ;

\- by its bad reputation, an element common to all three regions.

&amp;#x200B;

These places may have fostered a certain mix between the human populations and the CotF present, as well as an evolution in isolation.

&amp;#x200B;

# Way of living

&amp;#x200B;

We are not going to insist on the culture, we have already mentioned that it does not constitute formal proof of intermixing.

&amp;#x200B;

Let us simply note that the cultures of these very old peoples indicate that they have been close to the CotF. Probably in peaceful coexistence, because these three peoples are peaceful, have never shown any desire for external conquest, and respect nature.

&amp;#x200B;

# Powers

&amp;#x200B;

We know that among the CotF, some individuals called skinchangers or greenseers possessed powers.

The powers of the CotF are explicitly mentioned in relation to the Crannogmen.

The Naathis, on the other hand, seem to have a deep relationship with the butterflies of their island.

&amp;#x200B;

# Biology

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, these peoples have their own physical characteristics. The Lengiis are tall but it's not proof that they didn't lived close to the CotF. First, each environment produces its own subspecies. Moreover, the human ancestors of these three peoples were probably different from each other : the initial physical characteristics being not the same, the intermixing will give different results.

&amp;#x200B;

What interests us is those they have in common with the CotF, because it can be assumed that they acquired these hereditary traits through reproduction with the CotF, and that they were then transmitted from generation to generation.

&amp;#x200B;

Many features in the morphology of the mixed peoples recall the CotF. The Lengiis even have a physiological condition specific to CotF : night vision.

&amp;#x200B;

**But the eyes are the best indicator of the intermixing between human populations and CotF.**  In particular the colour of the irises: the golden specific to the CotF is found among the Naathis and Lengiis. As for the Crannogmen, the text mentions eyes of a strange colour, and Jojen Reed's description is unequivocal.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« The cat was an ordinary cat, no more. The others expected a fabulous beast, so that is what they saw. How large it was, they said. It was no larger than any other cat, only fat from indolence, for the Sealord fed it from his own table. What curious small ears, they said. Its ears had been chewed away in kitten fights. And it was plainly a tomcat, yet the Sealord said ‘her,’ and that is what the others saw. »  
&gt;  
&gt;AGOT – Arya IV

&amp;#x200B;

The mixed peoples are humans with CotF among their ancestors. We can imagine that human populations arrived on territories occupied by the CotF. As long as these humans were peaceful and respected nature, these two groups could coexist. Over time, intermixing has taken place, and traces of it can be found in current populations.

&amp;#x200B;

**In conclusion, all the clues are there to affirm that crossbreeding has taken place on a relatively large scale, which demonstrates that biologically humans and CotF are in fact one and the same species.**

&amp;#x200B;

The CotF are not supernatural beings, contrary to what the author leads us to believe. Since humans are the main subject of GRRM, this choice seems consistent. And it is not just another twist on a character's secret identity, because it is related the deep themes of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But before elaborating on the author's intentions, we must establish the origin of the CotF. The third and last part of our journey will take us back in time.

&amp;#x200B;

And we will see that, like the gigantic yellow cat with small ears of the Sealord, the specificities of the CotF have a rational explanation.

Terminology note: For the sake of clarity we will continue to distinguish between the terms human and CotF.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# 3- Origin of the Children of the Forest

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« Oh, to be sure, there is much we do not understand. The years pass in their hundreds and their thousands, and what does any man see of life but a few summers, a few winters? We look at mountains and call them eternal, and so they seem . . . but in the course of time, mountains rise and fall, rivers change their courses, stars fall from the sky, and great cities sink beneath the sea. Even gods die, we think. **Everything changes.** »  
&gt;  
&gt;Maester Luwin, ACOK – Bran IV

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« **There are none who can say with certain knowledge when the world began.** Is it forty thousand years old, as some hold, or perhaps a number as large as five hundred thousand - or even more ? It is not written in any book that we know, for in the first age of the world, the Dawn Age, men were not lettered.  
&gt;  
&gt;What can most accurately be told about the Dawn Age? The eastern lands were awash with many peoples. But on Westeros only two peoples existed : the Children of the Forest and the the giants. »  
&gt;  
&gt;TWOIAF

Let's be precise : it is said that the CotF preceded humans in Westeros, not on Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

**It is not said where, when or how humans appeared.**

**It is not said where, when or how the CotF appeared.**

&amp;#x200B;

It's not about nitpick. The question of origins is omnipresent in ASOIAF.

&amp;#x200B;

Who are the (true) ancestors of the characters?

Where do dragons, weirwood, the Others come from?

What happened in Summerhall, Hardhome, Ashaï... ?

&amp;#x200B;

How much truth is contained in the myths and legends of the past?

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning of the Dawn Age, indeed, the CotF occupied almost all the known world. And their encounter with humans took place in a second phase.

But what interests us takes place precisely before the Dawn Age.

&amp;#x200B;

Because the Dawn Age is not the first age of the world. ASOIAF takes into consideration long time and evolution, so the CotF must come from somewhere.

And it is not impossible in itself that humans and CotF belong to the same species. They are just two extremely different groups.

&amp;#x200B;

All that remains is the following question: what events may have led to this situation, where two such physically different human groups coexist on the surface of the Earth?

We could make hypotheses, but responding in a global, coherent and contextualized way requires a thorough examination of the CotF.

Some may have wondered how the presence of the Cot in the islands of Naath and Leng was possible, given that they are never presented as a people of sailors. This question seems less important, but we will see that it is part of the matter.

&amp;#x200B;

# Study of the Children of the Forest

&amp;#x200B;

We will list precisely what distinguishes them from humans in an attempt to understand their history.

&amp;#x200B;

# Powers

&amp;#x200B;

Without discussing the nature of magic, let's observe that humans have the same skills as CotF, the best example being Bran Stark.

So either magic transcends species, or the powers are specific to the human species. The second hypothesis seems to be the right one, as there is no mention of Ibbenians, giants and other evolved primates with CotF powers.

**In any case, powers cannot help us to differentiate between the two groups we are interested in.**

&amp;#x200B;

# Way of life

&amp;#x200B;

The way of life of the CotF is very similar to that of primitive human peoples: hunting, fishing, war, music, crafts (making tools, clothing and shelters), animist religion, preservation and transmission of memory of ancestors... The image of a classic hunter-gatherer tribe.

It should also be noted that they live in groups, which is not the case for some non-human peoples. It's a detail but it's very coherent from an anthropological point of view.

**In short, their lifestyle is no different from that of humans: studying their behaviour confirms what genetics has proven.**

&amp;#x200B;

# Society

&amp;#x200B;

A quick digression, which will be important later, about the civilizational differences between CotF and humans.

We know too little to say, but we may wonder whether the CotF powers have not profoundly changed their society. In particular the possibility of communicating quickly over long distances, as well as a perfect memory of the past. Perhaps also that their power to mix minds has increased the share of empathy in their psychology.

We find no evidence of war between CotF: have they succeeded in building a peaceful society?

The clues of the past presence of the CotF are the same everywhere, and it is because of this that we can identify them. The CotF seem to have a single language, a single culture, which suggests a globalized and unified society.

CotFs modify their environment extremely little, preferring to adapt to it. It seems that they have reached a stage where they can live in harmony with nature.

&amp;#x200B;

# Biology

&amp;#x200B;

So far we have observed beings that are not so different from humans : CotF simply have very particular physical characteristics.

&amp;#x200B;

Let us recall the specificities of the CotF: they are smaller than humans, have nut-brown dappled with paler spots, large slitted eyes, four fingers including one thumb, sharp claws, large ears, very developed hearing, and they see in the dark.

&amp;#x200B;

First we notice that, unlike humans, **the CotF have kept long sharp claws despite the fact that they use tools and weapons, including sharp blades.** From an evolutionary point of view, this observation must question us.

Are the CotF simply humans who have developed claws and other particular morphological and physiological characteristics? We have established that it is possible that the existence of humans precedes that of the CotF on Earth. We don't know which one appeared first: perhaps the CotF are the descendants of a group of humans, after all.

Humans that would have evolved because of mutant fungi from space, for example. Or to adapt to a new environment.

&amp;#x200B;

However, we can see that this is typically the type of features that can result from an evolution due to the environment. So let's leave the mutant fungi aside.

The skin of the CotF, compared in the text to a deer's one, evokes their forest life.

Their ears and especially their eyes show a good adaptation to nightlife, or generally to a dark environment.

Their small size tends to show an adaptation to a confined environment.

**The four-toed clawed front legs are typical of some rodent and burrowing mammals such as squirrels (of course), but also prairie dogs and groundhogs.** In fact, these animals have five fingers, but their legs are adapted to their use, and the thumb is atrophied or even invisible. We can imagine that the same is true for the CotF, that they simply have a finger largely atrophied, but that unlike animals they have kept the thumb, which they use to handle tools and weapons.

&amp;#x200B;

So, to what environment should humans have adapted to develop all these physical characteristics?

&amp;#x200B;

# Underground

&amp;#x200B;

It's time to talk about the CotF link to the underground. Indeed, let us recall that, surprisingly, this people is known to appreciate two very different types of environment: wooded or marshy environments, and then caves, hollow hills, and any kind of tunnels... which is surprising in itself. The CotF are well adapted to life in the forest, which seems to be their natural environment.  What is the point of going underground ?

# Refuge

&amp;#x200B;

The underground seems to be the CotF's natural refuge when they feel threatened. We have many examples of this, such as in the Stormlands during the conflict between the First Men and the Andals.

This raises the question of their subsistence. How do they survive, once they take refuge in the tunnels ? Do they go out at night to hunt ? Do they feed on rats ? Without claiming anything, let us simply remember that the Giants called the CotF *the people who store for winter*.

&amp;#x200B;

# Obsidian 

&amp;#x200B;

It seems to be a volcanic rock, but we will not discuss the nature or origin of obsidian. Let us simply point out that this material has magical properties and that it is found in its raw state, among other places, in the old tunnels beneath the Peyredragon mountain.

For the CotF, obsidian is the raw material of their primitive technology. They cut this sharp but fragile stone to obtain blades and arrowheads.

At first sight, knowledge of obsidian is not a specificity of the CotF: the Valyrians used it to make magic candles to see and communicate over long distances. On the other hand, it is never mentioned about mixed race peoples. It seems that, despite the intermixing, the CotF did not wish to share this knowledge with the humans they met. We can suspect the CotF to know the magical properties of the obsidian, and to use it for more... secret uses.

One last detail about the obsidian. TWOIAF emphasizes the great art with which the CotF work with this material, which suggests that they have a perfect mastery of it. Moreover, they did not invent weaving and continue to make clothes from raw materials. Could it be that the use of obsidian constitutes for them a more ancient knowledge than those related to life in the woods?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, they are very well adapted to the underground world (perhaps even better than to the forest, where they had to develop a minimum of technologies necessary for their survival), and that they have a perfect knowledge of underground networks.

This could explain their presence in the islands of Leng, Naath, and certainly others (there are indications of their presence on Skagos, in particular).

The underground could well be the primal environment of the CotF.

# Conclusion

&amp;#x200B;

We have found that the CotF, despite superficial differences, are extremely close to humans, which confirms the demonstration by genetics.

All our observations lead us to ask the question: **are the CotF the descendants of humans who have been forced to live below the earth's surface long enough to evolve there, thus adapting to this new and extreme environment?**

The next step is to place this assumption in the general context of ASOIAF.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;« Men should not go wandering in this place… The river you hear is swift and black, and flows down and down to a sunless sea. And there are passages that go even deeper, bottomless pits and sudden shafts, forgotten ways that lead to the very center of the earth. Even my people have not explored them all, and we have lived here for **a thousand thousand of your man-years**. »

Who are the CotF ? Where do they come from ? When and how did they appear ?

This is my theory.

&amp;#x200B;

Long before the Long Night, long before the Dawn Age, at a time when the CotF did not yet exist, humans already populated the Earth.

It all starts when a disaster strikes. A cataclysm. The apocalypse. Extreme glacial era, comet impact, invasion of mutant fungi... Whatever its nature, it is a disruption of such magnitude that it will eradicate the human species from the surface of the Earth for a very, very long time.

Thus begins the Night Age.

&amp;#x200B;

Humans have managed to survive and perpetuate the species. ASOIAF tells the story of their very distant descendants: the CotF people and the First Men.

&amp;#x200B;

The CotF's ancestors are humans who hid far, far below the Earth's surface. These humans survived despite everything. Over time, they have evolved physically to adapt to underground life. And somehow, some of them have acquired powers. But their true nature remains unchanged : they are still humans. This new people takes the name of ""those who sing the song of *earth*"".

As for the ancestors of the First Men, they were able to survive in some shelter, without having to adapt to a new environment. In a bunker, an arch, or a lunar base.... A place that must look like Winterfell or the Eyrie. An impregnable fortress, isolated from the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Time passes. Centuries and millennia, possibly more. Until finally the Earth's surface becomes inhabitable again.

&amp;#x200B;

So the CotF, wherever possible, come out of the underground and gradually adapt to life in the forest.

This is Dawn Age day one.

Humans, in turn, emerge from their shelter and begin to repopulate the entire Earth. In many places, they will be confronted with the CotF.

Much later will happen the Long Night and all the events narrated in ASOIAF.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The apocalypse, mutant humans... Oh, I know what you're thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

*That's exactly the kind of story GRRM likes to tell !*

&amp;#x200B;

It's time to visit an old friend.

269,"I just got through listening to the audio books of the Dunk and Egg stories and they're so so great! It's nice to read about Westeros in a time when it wasn't so ravaged - relatively. Boy the Targaryens are an interesting bunch eh, thank the Gods I've still got the Fire and Blood books to read!  


highly highly recommend you read these short stories if you haven't already!",asoiaf
270,"What was the relationship between Tyrion and Robert? I mean, if my memory isn't failing me, they never speak to each other in the books, do they? Do you think they got well along? Both like to drink, fuck and while they have many things in contrast they also both like to have fun. I understand people are more complex than that but considering Tyrion probably didn't see Robert as a political thread and Robert only saw Tyrion as his spouse's brother, they probably didn't have to much to worry about each other. They probably weren't BFF, but can you imagine a night in the fire, both of them having some wine in their hands, talking about trivial things? The things they could say, the jokes they could make... They're both some of the funniest characters in the books, both of them talking and laughing could have been tremendously entrataining.

Btw, the books are terrific, they've surprassed all of my expectations, although I'm still only at Clash of Kings, but really looking forward for the rest of them.",asoiaf
271,"The [Food Code](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/95101-the-food-code-of-ice-and-fire/) is an interesting essay detailing the symbolism of different foods in ASOIAF, and if you haven't read the whole thing, do yourself a favor. The part about boar being used as a herald to a shift in power is the part I'll be referencing here:

&gt;Next we have boar. This seems to denote regime change or a shift in power. Robert's hunting party goes in search of boar before Bran is defenestrated. Most clearly, Robert is killed by a boar and actually thinks it's a god-sent punishment for his plan to kill Dany; the boar is served at his funeral. In between Yoren's death and being captured by the Lannisters, Arya and her friends discuss hunting boar. Boar is served at the Winterfell harvest feast before the ironborn and Theon take over the castle.

 I was watching the new Preston Jacobs video, when this line from Jon IX AGoT popped out at me:

&gt;""All I know is that the blood of the First Men flows in the veins of the Starks. The First Men built the Wall, and it's said they remember things otherwise forgotten. And that beast of yours... he led us to the wights, warned you of the dead man on the steps. Ser Jaremy would doubtless call that happenstance, yet Ser Jaremy is dead and I'm not."" Lord Mormont stabbed a chunk of ham with the point of his dagger. ""I think you were meant to be here, and I want you and that wolf of yours with us when we go beyond the Wall.""

The ""between the lines"" part that really stuck out was
&gt;Lord Mormont stabbed a chunk of ham with the point of his dagger.

It felt like a neat little nudge that something significant was going to happen as a result of Mormont's faith in Jon's place at the wall. I know it's not boar perse, but it's close enough when we're at this stage of mining for things we haven't caught yet.",asoiaf

273,"One of the quotes or Martin's that gets repeated often is his quote about Aragorn. ""Tolkien tells us that Aragorn ruled wisely and well, but how do we know?""

Well, Mr. Martin, how do we know Bran ruled wisely and well?

I like the idea of the final King not being the prophesied prince but rather the boy in a wheelchair who proves himself wise and just, but... Well, in my opinion Martin hasn't earned it. Bran's arc is about many things, but leadership isn't one of them. Sure, we can come up with neat ideas as far as foreshadowing and cool aesthetics like an Aegon Targaryen kneeling to a Brandon Stark, or Bran looking into Jon's eyes and not executing him like Ned taught him in the first chapter. But as far as nuts and bolts character arcs, so far Martin hasn't earned his wise and just King, in my opinion. I don't know how the next two books change that without radically shifting Bran's story.",asoiaf
274,"So what parts of the show's ending and the end for the individual characters can we expect to see in the books? GRRM refers to the ending being his in a broad sense but that could mean a few things.

Objectively speaking, i think King Bran is definitely GRRM's ending. Ignoring the fact that its been confirmed by the actor and D&amp;D about being word of GRRM, D&amp;D have no real reason for lying about it being GRRM's and they have no reason to favour Bran. D&amp;D are many things but i don't think they ever claimed to be fans of Bran's character. I'm not even sure if he was in season 5. D&amp;D are often accused of favouring certain characters over others due to personal bias which can be hard to refute in some cases. But they haven't exactly concealed that Arya and Cersei and their respective actresses are their favourites. Why would they suddenly decide Bran needs some love? After perhaps Stannis and Renly, they clearly cared least for Bran. I'm surprised they didn't find a way to kill him off, that would have surprised people.

Jon's ending i actually quite like in some ways. Azor Ahai stabs his lover, leaving him with a sword and a broken heart to depart into darkness of either the Nights Watch or Beyond the Wall. He finally receives the answer to the question he asked Ned before he left for the Nights Watch about his mother, and its certainly not the one he expected. As for his role in defeating the potential apocalypse in the Others, I don't know. My problem with Jon Snow being the chosen one and being so important that he needed to be born is it almost validates Rhaegar and Lyanna's terrible decision to elope. I mean last we see of him in the books he is in the process of deserting the Nights Watch despite the unrest between the Watch and Wildlings and how the last guy through the gate, Borroq a skinchanger, flat out tells him the Others are coming all in the pursuit of vengeance.

Dany's ending makes some sense too. The 'Mad Queen'. The foreign conqueror. From my perspective, it will hardly matter whether or not Dany does go 'mad' or burn down Kings Landing intentionally, her enemies will label her as thus and will attribute the blame of a such an event to her whether intentional or not. At the end of the day, Dany is a foreigner to the people of Westeros (she even has a Tyroshi accent), she is a conqueror and shes actually quite good at it all things considered. Her strategy in beating the slave cities whilst ruthless and i suppose 'without honour' weren't without intelligence and she did it with negative casualties gaining more troops then she lost. But conquest and ruling are two different things and Dany is shown to struggle with rulership in Mereen. Given Tyrion's machinations with fAegon, if fAegon fulfils the same role as show Cersei its hard to see how Dany will not be seen negatively. Dany will be arriving with 3 fire breathing monsters renowned for killings thousands and torching landscape, eunuch slave soldiers or alternatively a fanatical army of foreign infantrymen that answer exclusively to her, Dothraki and at her side one of the most despised men in Westeros...Tyrion.

Tyrion's ending...seemed too simple really. After all that his main contribution was a speech so convincing he basically told the most powerful remaining people in Westeros not only how they should run things but who should lead them. Tyrion's most recent chapters are some really dark stuff and he isn't exactly the most popular man in Westeros at the moment. They are already making him the villain in plays based off the events of War of the Five Kings and his appearance is hardly helping his image. The first lesson he teaches to fAegon is one of mistrust and he encourages him to invade despite him knowing just how dire the situation in Westeros is for the motivation of getting revenge. Its hard to imagine Tyrion as he was in the show where he was the 'good guy'. Perhaps villain is too strong a word, but its hard to see him being a good influence on much. Also, I think the whole him not being mentioned in the book about the series events in universe is a bit out. Every story needs a villain, whether he is one or not the story won't mention him positively.

Cersei and Jaime i really don't know. I find the whole 'show Cersei is fAegon' quite convincing and it could really change Cersei's story. I find it kind of hard to see Cersei being anyway competent after reading A Feast for Crows

Sam and Bronn. Can't see it. Maybe its too subtle for me but really didn't get their endings.

So those are my thoughts on a few of the endings for the characters. Really not sure about the rest of them.

**TL;DR What parts of the shows ending do you think we will see in the books? Which characters will have similar/same endings?**",asoiaf
275,"Characters like fAegon/young Griff, Griff/Jon C, Quentyn Martell, Arianne Martell, Brown Ben, Victarion Greyjoy, Lady Dustin, Blackstar, Garlan Tyrell, Val, lord Manderly (if he was in it for more then 1 scene), Tristifer Botley and more",asoiaf
276,"The ""conventional wisdom"" proposed in AWOIAF is that Rhaegar secretly bankrolled the Tourney of Harrenhal on behalf of House Whent to gather the lords of the realm together to discuss how to get rid of Aerys, but that seems implausible. 

First of all, it's really bad writing to propose a mystery and then provide the answer in the next sentence. Usually if AWOIAF brings up a theory that's probably mostly correct, it will be dismissed in the next sentence. See ""fire wyrms + wyverns = dragons"" or ""Ironborn are from west of Westeros.""

Second, Rhaegar probably didn't have much money besides his royal pension for personal needs. Dragonstone is a pretty poor holding in terms of actual productivity. And that much money disappearing from the royal treasury would be noticed. Plus, supposedly when Robert won the rebellion the treasury was pretty full.

Tywin on the other hand, is the wealthiest man in the Seven Kingdoms and could definitely pay for the tournament. He was the most notable absence from the tournament, meaning no one would have reason to suspect him. Which is probably what a ""shadow host"" would want. And he may have been intimately involved in Rhaegar's possible plans to depose the king. *Or* he may have wanted people to think Rhaegar was trying to overthrow Aerys so he would be disinherited, and Tywin could perhaps wed Cersei to Viserys.",asoiaf

278," I'm rereading the books, and I've found *(a lot of really obvious things that I missed)* that glass gardens are Planetos Greenhouses built over volcanic vents or hot springs!

My questions:

1. Why are all the glass gardens in Winterfell? Do any other regions on Planetos use glass gardens? I don't find any references to them outside of Winterfell (not even in other parts of the North)?
2. How many glass gardens did they have?
3. Were they big enough to sustain Winterfell through the Winter?

Am I missing something? I'd love your input or thoughts! Thank you!

Quotes:

*The glass gardens were smashed, and hot water gushed from the cracked walls to steam beneath the sun.* (Bran)

*It was always warm, even when it snowed. Water from the hot springs is piped through the walls to warm them, and inside the glass gardens it was always like the hottest day of summer.* (Sansa)",asoiaf

""My princess,"" he sobbed. ""We've been dishonored, Aenys says. There was a bird from the from the Twins. My lord father says I'll need to marry someone else, or be a septon.""

A stupid princess, she thought, that's nothing to cry over. ""My brothers might be dead,"" she confided.

280,"I mean, in this scenario he would still kill Joanna with his birth, so I'm guessing that Tywin would still hate him a bit for that, but this leaves me wondering how different Cersei would treat him? I'm still not sure if Cersei hated him more for being a dwarf, for killing their mother at childbirth, or for being the, probable person that would kill her in the future. I at least expect Tyrion to be shown more respect seeing as he's not a dwarf.",asoiaf

And since the world of ice and fire is based on medieval Europe with pretty much his technology maybe the world map that we are used to is very very Innacurate.

285,"I'm sure everyone's now seen GRRM's famous 'yes and no and yes and no' response to whether the books will end the same way as the show. *If* we take a 'yes' to apply to a new, slightly more democratic rule over Westeros (and ignore the actual details of it, because elective monarchy does not a stable government make) and improved conditions for the small-folk no longer broken by the wheel of the noble game of thrones, then we have to apply a 'no' to the Medium Length Night. 

In Western European history, the most rapid and dramatic improvement in the lives, rights, and conditions for common people was as a result of the Plague, which killed around 1/3 of the population. The resulting labour shortage and land availability made the following century a 'golden age' for peasants and labourers (not uncontested, as in many places the ruling class resisted with laws criminalising changing employment). 

If GRRM is looking to end on a hopeful note with the improved lives of the smallfolk -- and I think he is, given the strong thematic emphasis in ASOIAF on the suffering of the smallfolk -- then the coming of the Others will have to be as devasting to Westeros as the Plague was to Western Europe. Millions will die, the rich and the poor alike, shattering the existing social order to enable something new to be created.   Or, as Old Nan says: 

&gt;They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms, felled heroes and armies by the score, riding their pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain. All the swords of men could not stay their advance, and even maidens and suckling babes found no pity in them. 

Or, as Boccaccio wrote of the Plague:

&gt;How many valiant men, how many fair ladies, breakfast with their kinfolk and the same night supped with their ancestors in the next world! The condition of the people was pitiable to behold. They sickened by the thousands daily, and died unattended and without help. Many died in the open street, others dying in their houses, made it known by the stench of their rotting bodies. 

In addition, Euron's probable attack on Oldtown mirrors the particularly acute effect of the Plague on monasteries (centres of learning) because the sick sought refuge there. In the wake of the Plague, the lack of trained clergy opened up learning and religious leadership roles to people previously barred (including laymen and laywomen). The breaking of the order of the Maesters and their replacement by an even slightly more egalitarian educational system would again fit with GRRM's concern with the unjust effects of inequality on people's lives and prospects.

286,"Lyana asked Ned to promise to protect Jon, which he did the best he could, sacrificing his honour, causing his wife's anger, etc. When Ned and Jon parted ways, Ned said that, next time they saw each other, they would speak about Jon's mother. But would he really tell the truth?

When Ned discovered the truth about Cersei's children, he wanted to tell Robert, but when Robert died, he turned to Stanis as the rightful heir. Did the Targaryens lose all the rights to the throne after Robert's rebellion, including both Vyseris and Dany, and Jon as Raeghar's son? When Bran tells Sam abouts Jon's parents, and they realize he is a Targ, Bran says that he is the rightful heir to the throne? Is it only because Stanis and Renly are dead? Does it mean that, were they alive, as the last of the Baratheons, Jon as a Targ would not have a claim to the throne?

Do you think Ned would ever tell Jon the truth about his parents, about who he really is and what he might be? Perhaps after Robert's death? Or do you think he would rather keep it a secret to protect Jon, to prevent a possible war, even though it wouldn't be fair to Jon and wouldn't be honourable?

292,"Now, before anyone tears me to shreds about why he should finish the series (I share the sentiment but have come to accept the strong possibility of it never occurring), let me clarify what I mean by this posing this question (doubt I'm the first to do have done it).

There are a GREAT deal of readers who have invested in the ASOIAF for years, even decades, who have spent countless hours speculating and theorising about how the both individual plot lines and the greater plot will unfold in the final two books should Mr. R.R. Martin ever finish them. The sheer amount of these theories, whether they be complex or fairly straightforward, well thought out of half-baked, concern the greater story or the more minor ones, have resulted in a following and a large, world-spanning  community that is rare (to say the least) amongst any works of fiction, let alone within the fantasy genre. 

One thing I have come to notice fairly quickly in my hours of scrolling through and reading countless theories and predictions is the sheer variety of them in their large number. There are other works of fiction for whom I hold great affection but the raw and unfiltered creativity that has shown itself within the ASOIAF community renders this same same qualities of the others pale in comparison. One thing that have come to realise more recently, especially following the conclusion of the show, is the way in which a lot of these theories (with a great number of them starkly contrasting to one another) fit so well within the world and tone of Martin's world and characters, whereas with other works of fiction theories tend to just be an extension of hopeful fan-fiction (of which the same sort is present within the ASOIAF community, as well).

As someone who has watched the show and has begun reading the books, I must say that one of the things I truly enjoy the most about the series is endlessly reading theories about characters I love, hate and even those who I haven't even read about yet. The point I'm getting at is that I'm sure there is a great deal of other people who feel the same way about the series and the vast amount of possibilities/directions it can go in from a storytelling point of view as I do and for those people I just want to share the same question that has been bugging me for quite some time now; do you really want to see the series concluded (answer is most likely yes and, if so, I agree) or do you find more joy in contemplating all the different in which the story COULD end? 

Granted, even if (hopefully) George R.R. Martin does end up finishing the series, the ending has a good chance of raising even more questions then there before and provide more points of speculation. Even so, and I'm being completely subjective here so don't take this as something in attempting to argue as being objective, there will be a great deal of what i love about the series that will be missing should the story ever reach its conclusion.

Tldr; Setting aside the obvious fact that most, if not all of us would like to see Martin's magnum opus reach its conclusion, do we really want to see that day if it means the end of so much fun and fascinating theorising and speculation?

Idk, just something that I thought would make for decent discussion. Could be wrong.

Note: Personally speaking, I adore George R.R. Martin both as a writer and as a person. In my opinion he has already given me and so many, many others great pleasure in reading his works and investing in his stories and characters that it doesn't matter whether he finishes his books or not because he has already given us so much. At the end of the day it all comes down to the fact that it's up to him how he lives his life and how he enjoys his immense success and I wouldn't have it any other way. I myself am very looking forward to Elden Ring, the upcoming FromSoftware dark fantasy game for which Martin provided the mythology of the story (it's also pretty neat that Martin got to work with Hidetaka Miyazaki, another amazing storyteller imo and who just happens to be a massive fan of Martin's works, in a medium completely seperate from the ones he has worked on before).",asoiaf
293,"As we all know, in ancient to medieval times, salt was a prized mineral. It's as vital today as it was since time memorial, just a lot cheaper due to mass production and abundance. Obviously, ASOIAF is based upon the real world and even real world events that we can draw parallels as a basis for our imaginations. 

In the stories, salt is mentioned many times as far as importance to where someone was sitting at the table - due to the limited availability of salt and I presume the price of salt?

Now, it's never mentioned where the salt comes from. We have the Saltpans which somehow produces SOME salt but the Lord is a petty lord and holdings small. If there was a lot of salt there, why wouldn't he be much more powerful? There's also the Salt shores but no real mention of salt production.

We know the Lannnisters have gold mines and tin and Iron come from the Iron islands, for the most part. It'd be nice if they mentioned where copper came from but that's whatever. I want to know what lord controls the salt as they would surely have vast holdings, money, and power for controlling such a vital commodity.

Rome was infamous for its salt mines. If you have a city of a million people, such as Kings Landing, small scale salt production won't cut it. There's gotta be salt mining operations somewhere and a lord that controls it.",asoiaf
294,"In the sample chapter 'The Forsaken' from The Winds of Winter this is a quote from one of Aeron's visions after Euron makes him drink shade of the evening.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the burning forest is a foreshadowing of the burning of the library/citadel at Oldtown. It seems likely Euron will be attacking Oldtown in The Winds of Winter and a library is a symbolic 'forest' as books are made out of trees. I can't think what literal forest Euron would be burning so the symbolic interpretation seems more likely to me.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to this Oldtown parallels the ancient city of Alexandria, both having famous lighthouses and libraries and being centres of learning. The library at Alexandria was damaged by fire and eventually lost entirely. I'd wager George RR Martin has set up the library/citadel at Oldtown to be burned down.",asoiaf
295,"I’m just hitting this point in ASoS, but I’ve seen the show so I know what’s coming. A couple things have stood out to me:

1. Cat tells Robb to make sure he eats something ASAP when he gets inside so he has guest right.

2. Grey Wind starts growling as soon as the Freys ride out to meet them, going so far as to charge them and ignore Robb’s commands, and doesn’t calm down once they’re inside, to the point that Robb leaves him outside.

3. The Freys who ride out make a big deal about Jeyne not being there, about how much their father was looking forward to seeing her. Walder does the same thing once they get inside.

I know hindsight is 20/20 and they really needed Walder Frey, but it seems there’s a point at which they should have thought, “You know, these things together don’t bode well. We should cut our losses.” Cat in particular is usually very attuned to this kind of thing (see: point 1). Is the idea that guest right is so inviolable that they are/should be totally safe once they’ve eaten/drunk something? Is there anything Walder could have done in this lead-up that would have made Robb and co reconsider going inside?

My other question:

297,"Throughout the history that we know of Westeros, there have been many events that seem to parallel each other through time. Different groups of men invade Westeros, up until Westeros is able to fight against them if the War of Ninepenny Kings could be viewed as such an invasion going awry. We see good Targaryens and bad Targaryens and ones who sit around doing little of anything. But I have a theory that events from the first Blackfyre Rebellion up until Robert's Rebellion may have been a chorus within the ""Song of Ice and Fire"", and what we see unfolding in the books is the chorus playing faster and a little bit out of order.

**The First Blackfyre Rebellion**

The First Blackfyre Rebellion was caused by Aegon IV legitimizing all of his bastards, of which he had many. Two of the the better known Blackfyres were Brynden and Aegor Rivers, half brothers whose mothers were from feuding Houses; the Blackwoods and the Brackens. We know them better as Bloodraven and Bittersteel.
Aegon IV, known as Aegon the Unworthy for his fall into lust and corruption. As a young man Aegon IV was handsome and skilled with the lance and the sword and was fond of hunting and more importantly, women, which lead to the birthing of the Great Bastards. 

The First Blackfyre Rebellion began when Daemon I Blackfyre, known earlier in life as Daemon Waters, rose up against his half brother Daeron II. The rebellion supposedly happened because Princess Daenerys, Daemon's half sister who he had wished to marry, was married off to a Dornish Prince.

The First Blackfyre Rebellion seems to parallel the Dance of Dragons, with the Dance having the Greens and the Blacks pitted against each other while the FBR had the Blacks and the Reds. It also seems like certain traits of both Aegon IV and Daemon Blackfyre are present in Robert Baratheon. Robert has Aegon's lust and fondness for hunting, while he has Daemon's motive for rebelling against the king; the woman he loves being out of his reach.

**Character Connections**

Several characters in the current books have traits similar to ""older characters"", and their actions seem to mirror this. I already mentioned Aegon IV, Daemon I Blackfyre and Robert Baratheon, but let's look at some others.

Robb Stark seems to parallel his uncle, Brandon, just as Ned seems to parallel his father Rickard Stark due both pairs going south and eventually dying their, although the causes are much different. Robb also has the apparent charm his uncle possessed. Ned also has similarities to Cregan Stark as both rode south during a time of uncertainty to become Hand, and both held the office for a brief time. It has been pointed out that Robb also has some similarities to Daeron the Young Dragon, both in youthful house titles and dying in their ""conquered"" land.

Bran has some parallel to Bloodraven with his ties to greensight. He also has some parallel with Benjen, being the young Stark left to rule Winterfell.

Jon has ties to both Ned and Benjen being the quiet counterpart to Robb and the Stark who joins the Night's Watch.

I probably could go on and on with some of these, but I won't because I know all of you are smart cookies who love this series as well and have likely noticed these types of connections before.

**Where am I going with this?**

My point for all of this is a prediction of where the series is headed based on the idea that these parallels support the concept that this is the ""Chorus"" of the Song of Ice and Fire, which I believe to be an analogy for history, specifically the history of humans. The Song of Ice and Fire is man against nature, and it has it's unique verses as well as it's choruses.

The prediction isn't specific, but it does revolve around one thing. I predict that by the end of the books, based on what we know from the show and these parallels, the world will oddly end in a state similar to which the series began.

298,"EDIT: Just to clarify, I'm not talking about people in this sub. Most of the concern is with mainstream media starting to bash the show and then the mainstream audience following suit. I should have been more clear.

&amp;#x200B;

When season 8 came to a close, it seemed like the amount of people criticising the show had substantially increased. I guess this is mostly due to people not liking the ending because ""the writing in season 8 was bad"". But c'mon, the show's writing hasn't been good since season 4.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since the show deviated from the books, the quality of writing has been consistently bad (with exception to a few characters &amp; plot lines). The only reason these people didn't like the writing in season 8 compared to seasons 5, 6 &amp; 7 is because they didn't get the ending they wanted. They got upset because the ending wasn't satisfying to them, and jumped aboard the bandwagon, using the guise of ""bad writing"" to express their grievances.

&amp;#x200B;

All of a sudden, a new wave of people were criticising the writing. And I initially thought, great, the mainstream fan base has finally realised the faults of the recent seasons. But this isn't the case, their main issue is with season 8. I'm not trying to say what people can and can't like, if you like the latter half of the show then great. But at least be consistent.

&amp;#x200B;

While I agree that seasons 5, 6 &amp; 7 are a tiny bit better than season 8, they're still pretty much on the same level. I don't understand how you can be content with season 7 but hate season 8. Where were these people during season 5?, which had one of the worst plot lines in the show. It just seems like bandwagoning to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, rant over. Has anyone else noticed this as well?",asoiaf
299,"Hey everyone! I wanted to make post to discuss this Martin interview I found: 

&gt;""It was the summer of 1991. I was still involved in Hollywood. My agent was trying to get me meetings to pitch my ideas, but I didn’t have anything to do in May and June. It had been years since I wrote a novel. I had an idea for a science-fiction novel called Avalon. I started work on it and it was going pretty good, when suddenly it just came to me, this scene, from what would ultimately be the first chapter of A Game of Thrones. It’s from Bran’s viewpoint; they see a man beheaded and they find some direwolf pups in the snow. It just came to me so strongly and vividly that I knew I had to write it. I sat down to write, and in, like, three days it just came right out of me, almost in the form you’ve read.""

Hasn't Martin also implied that things about the ending can be found in the first chapter before? This combined with that fact that his three day draft of it while having nothing else to go off of yet is ""almost the form"" we've read got me thinking and I re-read the first chapter.

Ultimately what I ended up thinking is what if at the end of the story Bran has to execute Jon for abandoning the Night's Watch? Jon is revived and abandons his post at the Night's Watch to save the realm or simply because he recognizes his vows are fulfilled. The rest of the story happens, Jon either never learns his family heritage or he does and turns down the Iron Thrones/never reveals it to the public, and eventually through a great council or conquest or some other politicking Bran ends up on the throne. However, either at the Great Council or through some other circumstance some of the lords start talking about how ""Hey, that bastard of Ned Stark's, he abandoned the Night's Watch."" Because how would anyone is the realm truly believe he could come to life. Bran in his first act as the newly chosen child King who many'a lords probably do not trust quite yet, rather than pardon an oathbreaker, executes Jon. Bran does it himself, taking in the lesson Ned passes to him in the first chapter that the man who sentences someone must look him in the eye and hear his final words.

Alternates/tinfoil time: If Bran is a malevolent CotF greenseer hivemind download like some people think, then this ending is even **more** interesting. Bran knows Jon to be innocent of any crime, yet in the first act as king both proves that he is willing to uphold the law to the lords even when it requires something as ""difficult"" as sacrificing family, and also in one swing of the sword kills the true heir to the throne, ending the Targaryen line and any legitimate opposition to his claim on the Iron Throne.

Or the lords call on Bran for Jon's execution and arranges for him to be smuggled out, perhaps to the Watch/North of the Wall. Timeskip and the epilogue of DoS he is found out, and Bran has his own son watch the execution. This mirrors the first chapter better but that's the only reason I thought it. Also would Bran really ever be apathetic enough to execute his brother rather than just pardon him and then get the lord's trust in other ways.

TL;DR: George thought of the first chapter before anything else in the series. Also says stuff like ""the ending can be found in the beginning."" What if at the end King Bran executes Jon Snow as an oathbreaker for abandonment of the Night's Watch?",asoiaf
300,"Inspired by [this exchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/80wwjp/spoilers_extended_why_is_bloodraven_never_talked/duz38vh/) I had a year ago. This is only half a shitpost...

Rhaegar was born of a line with significant Blackwood ties (Betha Blackwood being his great grandmother, but since his parents and grandparents are both sibling pairs, he had 50% Blackwood blood). As such Rhaegar is connected to both the First Men and the Targaryens.

Brynden Rivers was born of a line with significant Blackwood ties (Melissa Blackwood being his mother, so 50% Blackwood blood). As such Brynden is connected to both the First Men and the Targaryens.


---- 

Rhaegar was obsessed with prophecies, shared correspondence with Aemon, and was associated with GoHH, a Child of the Forest.

Brynden is heavily interested in prophecies, spent almost two decades with Aemon at the wall, and is working with Chidren of the Forest.

----

At one point Rhaegar was convinced that his son, Aegon, is TPTWP. He later went through great trouble to have another child (either another head of the dragon or a new candidate for TPTWP), and got killed as a consequence. 

At one point Brynden was convinced that his grand nephew, Aegon, has particular significance in the grand scheme of things.

&gt; ""What he is,"" said Bloodraven, ""is a dragon. Rise, ser."" 

He later went through great trouble to install Aegon on the throne, and got sent to the wall as a consequence. 

----

Rhaegar and his brutish second cousin both fell for Lyanna. Rhaegar got the girl, but this rivalry contributed to Robert's Rebellion.

Brynden and his brutish half-brother both fell for Shiera. Brynden got the girl, but this rivalry contributed to the Blackfyre Rebellions.

----

Robert killed Rhaegar near the end of the war, and later commented:

&gt; ""In my dreams, I kill him every night,"" Robert admitted. ""A thousand deaths will still be less than he deserves."" 

Bittersteel gouged Bloodraven's eye out at the end of the war. It is said that Bloodraven has *more than a thousand* eyes. 

----

Robert remained bitter after the victory, considered joining a sellsword company, and authorized attempts to exterminate the Targaryens.

Bittersteel remained *bitter* after the defeat, founded a sellsword company, and launched several more attempts to defeat the Targaryens.

(Also Robert was likened to steel, sigil colors, etc, but I digress)

---- 

Rhaegar died by (partly, Jon Connington's) values such as chivalry and honor:

&gt; ""[...] Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, Rhaegar fought honorably. And Rhaegar died.""

#

&gt; He was not wrong, Jon Connington reflected, leaning on the battlements of his forebears. I wanted the glory of slaying Robert in single combat, and I did not want the name of butcher. So Robert escaped me and cut down Rhaegar on the Trident. 

... while his opponent did not:

&gt; At the end they had the usurper hidden in a brothel. What sort of king was that, who would hide behind the skirts of women? 

Brynden lived by disregarding chivalry, reputation, and ""the glory of single combat""--raining arrows down on Daemon I Blackfyre, capturing Daemon II Blackfyre instead of fighting him in single combat, executing Aenys Blackfyre, etc.

... while his opponent did:

&gt; “So close a thing... if Daemon had ridden over Gwayne Corbray and left him to his fate, he might have broken Maekar’s left before Bloodraven could take the ridge. 

----

(Assuming B+S=M)

Rhaegar had a child by Lyanna. The child is unaware of his origins and thinks of Rhaegar as an enemy (of his adoptive father). 

Brynden had a child by Shiera. The child is unaware of her origins and thinks of Brynden as an enemy.

&gt; A face took shape within the hearth. Stannis? she thought, for just a moment... but no, these were not his features. A wooden face, corpse white. Was this the enemy? A thousand red eyes floated in the rising flames.",asoiaf
301,"That little finger was Lysa’s lover/got raped and impregnated her? It seems like during Robert’s Rebellion, Hoster Tully agreed to fight for Robert with one of the conditions being that Jon takes Lysa as his wife. It also seems like Jon knew that he would be taking a ‘soiled’ wife as Hoster mentioned something about how Lysa should be grateful that such a great lord would agree to take her as his wife despite losing her virginity. 

Accompanied with the fact that littlefinger immediately got exiled from riverrun and that probably people would gossip, surely Jon would’ve suspected something. And if he did, why is it that he agreed to Lysa’s suggestion of hiring him in the Vale/Gulltown and bringing him along to King’s Landing as well? Surely you want him far away just in case they decided to get together again.",asoiaf
302,"I mean, it was mentioned that the Greyjoys were building up their fleet for a while, so if say, that Stannis wasn't chosen to lead during the battle of the Fair Isles, and Victarion manages to destroy the enemy fleet, could they have theoretically wear down the enemy so much that they decide that the Iron Islands are more trouble than there worth?",asoiaf
303,"This is the one aspect of Bran becoming king in the show (and presumably the books) that bugs me. Taboos and cultural attitudes towards things like kinslaying and guest right have always been an important factor for lords in the books. And while ""the Old Gods"" are rather tolerated in the South, *wargs and greenseers are definitely not.*

&gt;""Warg. Shapechanger. Beastling. That is what they will call you, if they should ever hear of your wolf dreams.""

...

&gt;Lord Janos was red-faced and quivering. ""The beast,"" he gasped. ""Look! The beast that tore the life from Halfhand. A warg walks among us, brothers. A WARG! This . . . this creature is not fit to lead us! This beastling is not fit to live!""

...

&gt;The free folk fear skinchangers, but they honor us as well. South of the Wall, the kneelers hunt us down and butcher us like pigs.

So it seems to me there is going to have to be a complete reversal of these thousand+ year old attitudes by the end of the series, probably out of gratitude for something Bran does (unlikely). Or Bran is going to have to keep his powers entirely undercover and win an election with zero claim entirely on his own non-supernatural merits (more likely, but still pretty unlikely).

How do you see this playing out? Is Bran going to change everyone's mind about this hated class of people? Or is he going to be a closeted greenseer king?",asoiaf

305,"I’m on my third re-read of the series and just finished ACOK and it just boggles my mind about how delusional and idiotic Theon actually is. I get that he’s torn between Greyjoy and Stark but damn. Everybody on Pike hates him for nothing basically, I mean the kid is taken when he’s 9 to live with a hostile family as a glorified hostage. I mean did the Greyjoy’s expect him to murder Eddard and escape back to Pyke? You’d think that with the starks basically integrating him with their own family and giving him all the courtesies that befits his rank he would think of the starks as more of a family in my opinion. 

Then he gets to Pike with Robb’s letter and suddenly he’s hellbent on becoming the heir to his fathers “Crown”. He takes Wintertell without even thinking about it really, he just saw the castle was the heart of the north and decided to act. Asha actually gave him a pretty good lesson about this talking about how the power of the Greyjoy’s are at sea but winterfell is in the dead of the north. The whole time in winter fell he’s just stupid, he doesn’t set a guard on bran and rickon, he doesn’t even search the entire castle first before going and searching for them. Even the murder of the two decoys didn’t make much sense because all it did was solidify the hate of the north towards him, surely his time with the starks must have taught him that the north is fiercely loyal to the starks so “killing” the the two princes basically did nothing but make everyone hate him even more. 

I just wanted to share this because I don’t see a lot of posts about Theon Greyjoy, also im discussing this before he’s taken by Ramsey, so any actions by him as “Reek” are excluded from this discussion.",asoiaf
306,"You ever feel lonely?  Guys, you ever see a pretty girl, and smile, but she doesn't even look at you?  Then you see a group of pretty girls and just thinking about going up and talking to them makes 
you feel flushed and uncomfortable and your tongue ties up before you even try to speak?  You're self conscious -- you're a little short, teeth aren't great, you try to exercise but you're still pretty scrawny, your hair's receding a bit or you have acne, and maybe you've had some success with girls but you finally reach a point in your life when you just realize.....  I am not desirable?

You ever feel any of those feelings, even in passing, fleeting moments?  Can you recall, or imagine, how lonely that has made you feel?

Or have you ever done embarrassing things in your past, and you felt like your parents or siblings must have wanted to completely disown you?  You've got so many thoughts, you may be a bright guy who loves to learn and to read but you're just socially awkward for some reason that feels completely unfixable?

You ever think to yourself that life's not fair, that the odds are stacked against you, that there's so many things out there that you want that you know you'll never have -- most of all, you just want a little bit of love from someone who desires you?  But you remember all the things about yourself that make you undesirable?

I'm not complaining.  My life has turned out pretty decent.  I'm not ugly.  But I've certainly gone through those phases in my life when I feel like there's a hole in my life, and it's because of things I can't fix, and I'll never be able to fill that hole as full as I want it to be.

*That is Tyrion's entire life.*

I feel self conscious about my dumb hairline or my sub-average teeth or my thin arms when I talk to pretty girls.  But part of me knows it's all in my head.  Tyrion knows that everyone is looking at his height, his deformities, his mismatched eyes, and his new scar.  Can you imagine the extreme self-consciousness that he has?  Can you imagine going through life knowing that no one will ever feel sexual desire for you?  Knowing that you can never fix it or do anything about it?  In fact, they not only *not* desire him -- they're physically repulsed by him.  Can you imagine the only woman that shows genuine desire for you is a an ugly fat imp, like yourself, and knowing that she's better than you deserve?

Can you imagine how lonely and tortured he must be to live with that his entire life?

Then, throw onto that: you don't even have family to give you a hug.  They either want you dead, or they took away the one woman who ever actually showed you real affection.

Then throw onto *that*, that he has immense riches that should at least make it somewhat easier.  But no.  But even all the gold in the seven kingdoms does not earn Tyrion any desire or love.  All it does is put him in environments where the women are more desirable, but he himself is even less desirable by contrast.  His status actually makes his psychological needs *worse*.

This guy has to be the most lonely, angry, resentful human in Planetos, and how can we blame him?  I imagine that he feels roughly like school-shooters feel: bullied, unloved at home, never any romantic prospects to dream of, and finally, as of the end of ASoS, he has no real purpose in life either.  He at least was good at the game of thrones, before Joff was murdered.  He could at least hang his hat on that at the end of the night.

Now?  Floating through Essos, running away from assassins and slavers, he has less than nothing.

I'll come back to my analogy... that this is pretty much the psychology of a school shooter.  Poor family life, no romantic prospects, no work prospects, constantly bullied, shunned; someone who has nothing... and therefore nothing to lose.

And he's about to come home with dragons.

I'm a big proponent of the theory that Tyrion's going to push Dany, or mislead her somehow about the presence of wildfire in the city, and that he's ultimately the ""villain"" in the books, unlike his white-washed character in the show.  And just reflecting more on the actual mindset of this character... His story's even sadder than Catelyn's, to me.",asoiaf

The Unsullied obviously won’t travel to Naath in the books because of butterfly fever and I feel like this would also fill one of the show’s many plot holes: “Who’s ensuring that Jon stays in the NW?” (I believe Jon being sent back to the NW is part of GRRM’s ending)

310," 

There's a couple of things that have stuck out in what I've read so far:

\-Specifically with regard to Janos Slynt, it seems like there's a pretty elitist undercurrent in why he chose to send him to the Wall. He and Tywin both seemed pretty hung up on Joffrey giving him Harrenhal (which in fairness IS pretty weird), but it seemed like he was punished for daring to imagine himself superior, as much as it was an attempt for Tyrion to load the Gold Cloaks with someone loyal to him.

\-If Tyrion was so concerned about what a mess Cersei and Joffrey were making of things... why not just put them under house arrest? The Gold Cloaks were loyal to him, he had his Hill Tribesmen, and the Lannister household guard were sworn to prioritize his orders over Cersei's. Tywin gave him a clear mandate to do whatever he needed in order to restore order in King's Landing and rein in Joffrey's excesses, and he had enough evidence just walking in the door that Joffrey was having some Caligula-esque tendencies and that Cersei was both a thorn on his side and completely useless.",asoiaf

Which do you think was removed first and which do you think he had to be talked into?

Apart from Jon's last chapter, ADwD ends with a long string of Mereen-centric chapters, which makes me wonder if a bunch of Winterfell chapters were cut very late on, or if they're there because he was building up to the Battle of Mereen right up to the end.

321,"I've long believed that between the Tully sisters, Lysa was simply screwed over by fate where Catelyn got lucky. Cat got to have a happy, loving marriage with a man close to her age and 5 healthy, happy children, whereas Lysa was saddled with an old man, a series of miscarriages and stillbirths and a frail, sickly child. Between her denied love, forced abortion, loveless marriage and the rest of it, its no wonder her mental health deteriorated and she became this obsessive, paranoid, jealous bitch. 

&amp;#x200B;

But then, something made me reconsider this view - I read that Catelyn had seen Lysa last some 5 years ago. Cat mentions how the last time she saw Sweetrobin was when he was less than a year old. Given his birth in 292 AC and the series starting in 297 AC, the timing fits. And yet, Catelyn never made any not of Lysa's deteriorating mental state before. 

&amp;#x200B;

This seems clear from how she thinks of her - Cat believes in and trusts Lysa. When Ned expresses doubt that Lysa's accusations might be coming from grief, Cat defends her, saying that the caution she'd exercised in delivering that letter showed that she was of sound mind and they should take it seriously. When Blackfish suggests that Lysa meant to rule Vale herself, Cat once again replies that a woman can rule just as well as a man. Cat is certainly not the type to willingly blind herself to her family's faults - just look at how she treats Edmure. And yet, she trusts Lysa's words completely. 

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, there is her obvious shock when she meets her at Eyrie. Catelyn's horror at what Lysa has become is laid out in great detail. And in Catelyn's own pov, we had absolutely no hint of this. All this tells me that Lysa had been relatively sane and stable the last time they met. That she'd given Catelyn no cause for concern and her transformation really did come out of nowhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

So where did it come from? Lysa was forced to give up her love and abort her child 15 years ago. She was married to a man old enough to be her father right about that time. She'd suffered through miscarriages and stillbirths and until 5 years ago, she'd still somehow managed to retain her sanity. So why now? Did something happen in the last 5 years that broke Lysa? 

&amp;#x200B;

As a matter of fact, something interesting did happen 5 years ago - *Littlefinger came to King's Landing.* And that, I believe is the real reason behind her insanity. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lysa had never been Catelyn - she is always described as having been somewhat silly and immature as a child. Even so, she was a Tully. She'd been taught the same things as Cat - to put her family and duty first. I believe that while Lysa hadn't exactly been happy in her marriage, she'd have resigned herself to her fate and decided to make the best of it. The while she never stopped loving Littlefinger, she she decided that loving him from afar was the best she could do and chose to focus on her family instead. Had Littlefinger never come to King's Landing, hers would've been a sad and tragic tale of a woman who gives up her happiness for sake of her family and duty - as so many women in Westeros are forced to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

But Petyr did come to KL and I think as soon as he got there, he got to work on bringing Lysa under his thumb. He knew that she'd be a valuable asset and he did whatever her had to to bring her under his thumb - gaslighting her, emotionally abusing her, threatening her - every psychological trick he could think of. Lysa of 5 years ago might've balked at the thought of anyone poisoning her husband - but Littlefinger got her to the point where she'd do it herself. She'd have put her family before everyone - but after LF was done with her, she was willing to lie to them and betray them. Lysa's complete mental breakdown is because of Petyr Baelish - because of his abuse in attempts to bring her under his control. While everything else Lysa had been through certainly contributed, she might've survived it all if not for Littlefinger.

324,"In his memoir *On Writing*, Stephen King recalls advice he got form his editor during his first professional writing job as a highschooler covering sports news for a local paper:

&gt;""When you're writing a story, you're telling yourself a story,"" he said. ""When you rewrite, your main job is taking out all the things that are *not* the story.""

This was a lesson we had repeated to us during my years of grad school getting an MFA in creative writing (an education that makes you better at talking about writing than actually writing, at least in my experience), but there seems to be a counterpoint that I haven't really seen explored much. While taking out everything that is not the story seems to be advocating for minimalism, or at least a strong since of parsimony with the text, there are also tremendous works of literature that have gone in the opposite direction, towards maximalism.

Maximalist texts are those which seem to throw in every single detail and tangent imaginable. We don't know just that the hobbits are singing while leaving the Shire, or even just learn the lyrics to the song (*home is behind, the world ahead*), but learn that Bilbo wrote the lyrics to a tune he'd previously learned from the Elves and then taught the song to Frodo who taught it to the others. The Iliad recounts the details of the deaths, it seems, of nearly every person killed during the tenth year of the Trojan War, including far too many people specified as having been speared in the crotch. GRRM lets us know in savoring detail exactly what Lady Tanda is serving for dinner each and every damn evening.

During grad school, and for several years after, I thought of minimalism and maximalism as simply two different stylistic choices. We can enjoy a simple and easy ""just the facts ma'am"" story, and many stories prosper from the lightness of their text. At the same time, maximalism can be equally enjoyable, especially when we're placed in a fantastical world we want to dwell in for as long as possible.

I think to a certain extent this is right, and the degree of detail included is largely a stylistic choice. But, after letting the issue stew, rereading Thrones and Clash again, and having not an insignificant number of Hazy Little Things (dear Sierra Nevada, I'm looking for a sponsor), I think there's more to it, and at least as far as ASOIAF is concerned the style and story are intrinsically linked.

**All The Things *Are* The Story**

What if maximalism was not the counterpoint to the principle of removing everything that isn't the story, and is instead a different manifestation of that principle? What if the story is pears poached in wine, and savory fish rolled in salt and cooked crisp, and capons stuffed with onions and mushrooms, and great loaves of brown bread, and mounds of turnips and sweetcorn and pease, and immense hams, and roast geese, and trenches of venison and barley stew, and cream swans, and spun-sugar unicorns, and lemon cakes, and spiced honey biscuits, and blackberry tarts, and apple crisps, and wheels of buttery cheese? What if that can't be removed because *that is the story?*

It's easy to think of the Song of Ice and Fire as being chiefly about the Others and the dragons and the Prince That Was Promised, as being about Dany and Jon and Arya's journey to become a Faceless Man and Bran becoming the Three Eyed Raven, and all the other goings on of the high lords and their Game of Thrones and the War for the Dawn. Certainly the story is about all that, but it might also be about the disparity in wealth between Lady Tanda's table and flea bottom pot-shops. It might also be about the fact that Rodrik Cassel's brother had four sons, only Jory reaching adulthood, and Rodrik himself only having daughters. It might be about the butcher's boy.

While it will probably matter a great deal what children Rhaegar Targaryen fathered, it matters to Rodrik Cassel what children *he* has. Who (if anyone) eventually lands with Sansa matters, but so does who ends up with Lollys Stokeworth after her tragedy in the riot of King's Landing.

ASOIAF is about the fact that all these things matter. Robb seeking vengeance against the Lannisters for a once-in-a-generation travesty matters, but so do Mirri Maz Duur's vengeance against the Dothraki for their everyday savagery. One gate guard with a grudge, or a drinking habit, or a gambling problem, or a plain old fire in his loins can make as much difference as a high lord. This isn't a world just of kings and queens; it's a world of *everyone*, and only a maximalist style can accommodate that idea.

**A Caveat**

None of this is to say that maximalism always reflects the intent of a story, or that this is the only thing maximalism can do. I haven't read Lord of the Rings in some time so I haven't really thought much about it in this way, but I don't think it's about emphasizing the importance of mundane folk. I'm actually not really sure what to make of the style there. Same with The Iliad, I haven't read it since college (and gods, that was... 15 years ago?), though [Lindybeige](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aofPdMbXzUQ) has some thoughts.

But, when it comes to ASOIAF, I think maximalism is doing a lot more work than simply fleshing out the world. It's telling us what to think about it.

325,"So recently I've seen posts based on what we've seen in the final season (Dany burning King's Landing even though the bells were ringing) that predict that, in the books, Jon Connington will be triggered by the bells (as he's traumatized by his failure at the Battle of the Bells) and as a result he'll do something reckless.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless of whether or not Connington will be triggered (if he hasn't died of greyscale yet), this connection to the Battle of the Bells got me thinking: what if Dany's burning of King's Landing is basically a second Battle of the Bells in which fAegon does what Robert Baratheon did in the original battle (hiding amongst the smallfolk) but Dany, instead of doing what Connington did (trying to find the target without hurting other people) decides to just burn King's Landing (which, IIRC, is what her father said Griff should had done). *EDIT: My mistake, it was actually Myles Toyne from the Golden Company who later told Connington that Tywin would have burned the town.*

&amp;#x200B;

Thinking about it, this makes sense. Even if Dany is angry and becomes ruthless, if fAegon is still at the Red Keep, Dany could just burn the Red Keep, there is no need to burn the whole city... unless fAegon isn't at the Red Keep but instead is hiding inside the city.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*EDIT: I agree with TheDustOfMen! I think Dany will intend to destroy only a part of King's Landing - either the part where she thinks fAegon is hiding and/or a random part to ""scare"" the smallfolk and force them to deliver fAegon to her (or force fAegon to surrender in order to stop her from destroying the rest of the city - hell, maybe she even says something like ""for every hour that passes I will burn a part of King's Landing until fAegon shows up"").* 

*By doing that, Dany will also intend to make the people fear her (since she won't be able to make them love her, she'll make them fear her). However, as TheDustOfMen has pointed out, this will backfire, as the dragon fire will actually ignite the wildfire hidden under the city, leading to most of King's Landing being burned. It's ironic that it was Dany's father who planted the wildfire to prevent the city from falling in the hands of the anti-Targaryens, and now this same wildfire will make things worse for the Targaryen restoration!*

*But even after things get out of control, I think Dany will still stand by her decision of sending Drogon to burn part of the city. She'll say that she would do it again if she had to, despite knowing the consequences. And it will be this ruthless mindset of Dany - this attempt at being feared since she couldn't be loved - that eventually will lead Jon to kill Dany. So the ""mad queen"" Daenerys won't actually be insane like her father was, instead she'll just try to be ruthless like Tywin was (and, as some people pointed out, Tyrion might be at fault for that, at least partially, depending on the kind of advices that he will give to her when he becomes her Hand).*

While it doesn't get as much attention as the **Battle of Ice/Battle of Fire** or even the **attack on Storm's End**, the numerous characters/plots centered around Oldtown are extremely fascinating (at least to me).

I wanted to take some time to discuss the current plots/characters and possible outcomes of what will certainly be one of the most interesting parts of the intro to **The Winds of Winter**

***

I thought for awhile about the best way to break this down and no way seemed to work perfectly so I thought it would be best to do a list of characters then plotlines then outcomes:

#Characters:

**The Citadel**: Samwell Tarly, Alleras/Sarella, Leo Tyrell, numerous Archmaesters, ""Pate""

**Recently Left**: Marwyn (aboard the *Cinammon Wind*, headed to Slaver's Bay)

**Ironborn Fleet**: Euron/Aeron/Falia Flowers/Falia Flower's bastard/Pyat Pree

**Redwyne Fleet**: Led by Paxter Redwyne, the fleet is en route to Oldtown to deal with the Ironborn

**The Brave Companions**: a small band led by Urswyck the Faithful (and possibly including Three Toes, Togg Joth and Zollo) is headed to Oldtown or already there

**The Hightowers**: Leyton/Malora the Mad Maid/Garth/Baelor

***

#Current plotlines/goings ons/questions:

1)**The Sphinx is the riddle and not the riddler**: Is this in relation to Alleras/Sarella? Why does Aemon mention it?

2)**Sam/dragonhorn**: Why does the horn get mentioned so often? What will Sam learn at the Citadel?

3)**Euron's blood sacrifice**: What is Euron summoning (kraken/dragon/sea dragon/drowned god/cthulhu type creature)? Will it work? Who all dies? Does he have anymore dragon eggs? Who/what is he working for?

4)**Leyton/The Mad Maid**: Why hasn't Leyton left the Hightower in a decade? What book of spells are he and Malora looking at? Does he have a glass candle? Why haven't we met Leyton yet (he's the biggest Lord we haven't met by far)?

5)**The Faceless Men**: Are they working with Euron? Why did they need a dragon egg? What are they going to to with *The Death of Dragons* once they acquire it?

6)**Glass Candles**: The only known glass candles in Westeros are in Oldtown. Does Leyton Hightower have one? Did Marwyn take one with him to Slaver's Bay? What type of magic is involved?

7)**Aftermath**: Who wins the battle and which major characters die? (It seems Aeron (after 2 or more POV's) is marked for death and Sam will be our lone POV in this area.) Where does the victor/main characters head after the Oldtown plot is over?

8)**Minor Characters**: How will the minor characters affect the plot, if at all (Urswyck, Leyton, etc.)?

#Prophecies/Visions that could possibly be about Oldtown:

Dany's vision in THOTU (possible):

&gt;Then phantoms shivered through the murk, images in indigo. Viserys screamed as the molten gold ran down his cheeks and filled his mouth. A tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair stood beneath the banner of a fiery stallion, a burning city behind him. Rubies flew like drops of blood from the chest of a dying prince, and he sank to his knees in the water and with his last breath murmured a woman's name. . . . mother of dragons, daughter of death . . . Glowing like sunset, a red sword was raised in the hand of a blue-eyed king who cast no shadow. A cloth dragon swayed on poles amidst a cheering crowd. **From a smoking tower, a great stone beast took wing, breathing shadow fire**. . . . mother of dragons, slayer of lies . . . Her silver was trotting through the grass, to a darkling stream beneath a sea of stars. A corpse stood at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, grey lips smiling sadly. A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness. . . . mother of dragons, bride of fire . . . -ACOK, Daenerys IV

Mel's vision's at the Wall (probable):

&gt;Visions danced before her, gold and scarlet, flickering, forming and melting and dissolving into one another, shapes strange and terrifying and seductive. She saw the eyeless faces again, staring out at her from sockets weeping blood. **Then the towers by the sea, crumbling as the dark tide came sweeping over them, rising from the depths.** Shadows in the shape of skulls, skulls that turned to mist, bodies locked together in lust, writhing and rolling and clawing. Through curtains of fire great winged shadows wheeled against a hard blue sky. -ADWD, Melisandre I

and

&gt;""Some may."" Could the skulls in her vision have signified this bridge? Somehow Melisandre did not think so. ""If it comes, that attack will be no more than a diversion. **I saw towers by the sea, submerged beneath a black and bloody tide. That is where the heaviest blow will fall**."" -ADWD, Melisandre I

***

#Extra info:

- Well it hasn't been explicitly stated that Sam will return as a POV, it seems likely he will

- GRRM confirmed that Aeron would have more than one chapter in TWOW:

&gt;**Question**: With the use of the word ""the"", are you implying that there will only be one Damphair chapter in WINDS?

&gt;**GRRM**: No. -SSM, Baltimore and NYC: 6/12/2016

http://grrm.livejournal.com/490176.html?thread=24623296#t24623296

- We can also expect to see Willas/Garlan Tyrell at some point in TWOW, so do they come down to Oldtown or does Sam head to Highgarden after the battle?

- fAegon and the Golden Company ""still have friends in the Reach"". Who are these friends and does it affect Oldtown at all?

330,"Imagine if the Greatjon had done his famous KitN speech (or at least a similar speech) after the Battle of the Bells, which was the first military victory during the rebellion in which northern forces were involved (and before Robert was acclaimed King by the rebels). 


The circumstances were quite similar to the situation when Robb marched south sixteen years later: The King had just murdered the Lord of Winterfell, making his son the new Lord at a young age, who then marches south to get justice. In AGoT this was enough for the northerners to declare independence after they had won a great victory, declaring Robb their King.


But House Targaryen’s crimes were even worse than those of the Lannisters. Aerys not only killed Ned’s father, but his elder brother as well, and even asked for Ned’s head. Not to mention that his heir kidnapped Ned’s sister! It’s hard to imagine how peace could be possible under these circumstances, certainly not as long as either House Stark or House Targaryen exist. 


So if the Greatjon did his speech, is there any reason why the northern Lords wouldn’t be in favor of independence and acclaim Ned King in the North, like they did with Robb? As I said, this is before Robert has been acclaimed King by the rebels, so that shouldn’t be a problem. If it happened, what would be the consequences for the rebellion, as well as for Westeros in the long term? What would Ned’s reaction be? 


Would the other rebel Kingdoms follow suit, and acclaim their Lords independent Kings? I could see Robert liking the idea of being declared Storm King, but what about Jon Arryn and Hoster Tully? While the Arryns are an old royal House like the Starks, the same can’t be said for the Tullys. Would the Riverlands then join the Stormlands or the Vale, like they joined the North in AGoT? What effect would this have on the Lannisters and Tyrells? 


If the Seven Kingdoms broke apart in in the wake of Robert’s Rebellion, would Westeros be better off by the time AGoT starts (fifteen years later), or worse?",asoiaf

332,"**Tyrion's ending, where he becomes Hand of the King again and does the dirty work of ruling the ~~Seven~~ Six Kingdoms, is one that most people are not too bothered by. Here's why those people are wrong.**

1) **Tyrion began the series unloved.** Tyrion's entire life has been defined by the fact that his mother died giving birth to him, his father and sister despised him, and his one attempt at settling down with Tysha (who was a prostitute Jaime paid in the show, but in the books was actually a genuinely in love commoner) ended with her being sent away at his father's behest, but not before she got brutally gang-raped in front of him. So Tyrion fills the hole in his heart as best he can with alcohol and prostitution. 

**Tyrion ends the series still unloved, but with a bunch more of the people he loved dead.** Shae, who unlike in the books genuinely loved Tyrion, is dead. His entire family is dead. His monster sister (yes, she is a monster, sorry Tyrion) is no great loss. But Jaime was the only person within Tyrion's nuclear family who actually cared about Tyrion in his youth and treated him decently. And by setting him free from captivity Tyrion sent him to his death. Tommen, Myrcella, and Kevan, Tyrion's other decent family members, are dead.  Daenerys, who Tyrion apparently was in love with ([yes, really](https://io9.gizmodo.com/peter-dinklage-says-tyrion-has-the-hots-for-the-mother-1828862875)), is dead. His close friend Varys is dead.

And there are no real prospects that this situation will change in the future. Sansa, who we were given some vague hints might get back together with him in the last season, might as well be dead. He's the chief vizier, she's the queen of an independent realm whose subjects hate Lannisters. It's politically impossible. So I guess he's stuck hanging out with Pod and Bronn, trying to pay for prostitutes in a destroyed city with the money he doesn't have because Casterly Rock has no gold left. No wonder brothel reconstruction is such a high priority.

2) **Tyrion begins the series unappreciated.** Tyrion is, besides maybe Tywin, the most capable administrator in the series. Throughout the series he has ended up in numerous positions of responsibility, and at least early in the series before everyone caught the stupid plague he excelled. Military command? Tyrion can do it! Coinage and finance? Tyrion can do it! Intrigue and outmaneuvering malicious political factions? Tyrion can do it! Plumbing... you get the picture. 

Yet no one appreciates this work Tyrion does and they always attribute it to someone else, and blame Tyrion for anything that goes wrong. Tyrion is viewed as the ""twisted demon monkey"" who makes beloved Joffrey do cruel things and then murders him for his child wife's approval. Tywin gives him zero praise for his success in S2 and instead focuses on his whoring and drinking. Even Daenerys does nothing but scold Tyrion for inadequate performance, which isn't even that inadequate. How could he have known Euron could teleport? Or that the Tyrell army was completely worthless?

**In his ""new role"" (chief advisor to a child ruler, the exact same one he had in S2) Tyrion will still most likely be blamed for everything bad the new king does, and receive no credit for anything positive.** Nothing has changed. Tyrion will remain in the shadows, trying to do the hard work of ruling for a child psychopath who is fine with the deaths of thousands (but a cold, emotionless one this time instead of an impulsive one).

3) **Tyrion began the series with the childhood dream of having a dragon.** In the books this is much more important to him and indeed is probably 60% of the reason he's going to Meereen (along with 40% revenge and 0% whatever ""building a better world"" means). **He ends the series with all the dragons dead or disappeared, and he never got to ride one once.** Seriously, *Tormund Giantsbane and Sandor Clegane* got to ride a dragon and Tyrion didn't once because screw him I guess. This is a bit pettier than the other two but it bothers me anyway.

In conclusion, **show Tyrion's ending is not bittersweet but just bitter, besides ""Lord of a gold mine with no gold in it"" he gets essentially none of what he wants and is condemned to spend the rest of his life ""fixing his mistakes.""** Mistakes that stemmed mostly from Daenerys' inexplicable psychotic break when she was at the cusp of complete victory. If it's what GRRM intends for his favorite character that he's spent more pages on and more thoroughly developed than anyone else, then that strikes me as very odd.",asoiaf
333,"The show in my opinion, especially for the first 4 seasons, nailed Stannis’s stubbornness and his unyielding nature and really showed that he was the most determined man on the planet who would stop at nothing to take what in his mind was his right to rule.

But what they skipped over was something that the book eluded to which was his vulnerabilities one of which being his envy of his older brother Robert.

Always overshadowed by Robert and not as loved by the small folk or family or the lords of Westeros.  

Stannis I believe from a young age began to resent this and instead of moulding himself to be like Robert his stubborn nature made him into the opposite of his older brother.

Donal Noye said-

  “*Robert was the true steel,Stannis is iron. Black and strong but brittle. That one will break before he bends.*”

Donal Noye was master armourer for the Baratheon and was rumoured to have had crafted Robert’s famous Warhammer. He was the representation of the small folk and look at his opinion of Stannis. Maybe not negative but valued less than Robert.

Maester Cressen in the Prologue while being shunned by Stannis thinks back on the Baratheon brothers when they were young boys- 

“*Stannis, my lord, my sad sullen boy, son I never had, you must not do this, don’t you know how I cared for you, lived for you, loved you despite all? Yes, loved you, better than even Robert, or Renly, for you were the one unloved, the one who needed me most.*”

Cressen has been with Stannis for most of his life and has seen Stannis time and time again overshadowed by Robert. 

He even remarks by saying - “*Whatever Stannis did, Robert did first. And better*”.

Stannis is everything people say he is. Harsh, uncompromising and single minded. But he also is just a young boy who wanted to be like his big brother. Who wanted people to love him but didn’t know how to love. Who became resentful because of this but even so did his duty by his house and his family. 

I would of loved instead of Shireen being a plot device for shock by having her gruesomely killed by Stannis, actually be the rock that the wave of utter determination and destructive nature of Stannis breaks on. 

Stannis could be pushed to his limits as he is in the books now, snowed in with troops dying by the day, his claim being forgotten and Melisandre or his wife who hates Shireen says to offer kings blood, his daughter, to R’hollor for salvation. But Stannis rejects her and grabs her by the throat and tells them “*Never. God or glory or snow will never compel me to betray my daughters love. She is Princess Shireen of House Baratheon, the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. Not some by-blow of Roberts or abomination of incest. Marked by disease she is but I would dare the next God or man who tells me she is not worthy. She has always been worthy and you would do well to remember that when she rules in my place.*”

Shireen’s grey marked face is Stannis’s envy of Robert and Robert’s supposed superiority . A beautiful innocent young girl with true power yet they look at her with pity, disgust and dismiss her at every turn. 

This could have made Stannis one of the best written tv characters ever.",asoiaf
334,"I mean where they physically end up and what they’re doing by the end, not how they get there. Obvious answer is Bronn cause he definitely won’t be Lord of Highgarden with that many Tyrells kicking around in the books rather just a minor Lord of some random castle but who else do you think has a totally different endgame? 

I feel like the big 6 have more or less the same endings (Dany, Jon, Tyrion, Sansa, Bran and Arya) with better context.

Some measly stewards were given full dominion of the reach.  
  

Imagine house poole (stewards of the starks) being granted wardenship of the north and the lord paramounts of the north like the starks.  
  
Seems unfair to the other, ancient, nobler, richer, and prouder houses right?

343,"I am not a native English speaker and Asoiaf is the first formal English literature I have read. I haven’t finished all the books yet but there were some lines that oddly got stuck in my head so far.

The first is in the prologue of AGOT, when the ranger said ‘the wall was weeping’, and I immediately was struck by how brilliantly that word is used here. ‘Weeping’ ... 

And the atmosphere is downright amazing, the word ‘dead’ is mentioned so many times while the forest itself seems alive, ‘the trees rustled like living things’, ‘leaves whispered past them’...and I seriously held my breath when the dead ranger opened his eyes and strangled the alive one.

This chapter got me hooked on the series and I knew I was in for a wild ride.

The second thing that got stuck in my head is when describing Mel looking into the fire for visions, ‘sweat traced her skin like a lover’s hand’, which again, I thought about the sentence and was in awe of how vivid that is at portraying the image of her in pain, focused, trying to read into the fire. It really got stuck in my head in an odd way.

Marwyn has basically confirmed that the ""Grey sheep"" have their own agenda, so I doubt this guy will simply serve as a raven caretaker and healer.

My question is how would you make meaningful changes instead? There would need to be something akin to the Magna Carta or Aegon V's reforms, and while making it so that the king is elected rather than inherited is a good start, there also need to be laws and individuals to reign in a rulers power. While I would give Bronn a minor lordship with some land and a castle, I don't think he is qualified for such as massive position as  Lord Paramount.

We do know plans were made for Robyn to be fostered at Casterly Rock, apparently to ensure Lysa and Jon’s silence on the matter, as Cersei says in the text. Lysa may have been vocal about the Lannister’s murdering her husband, but there are no indication that she knows about the paternity of Cersei’s children. Who informed Cersei about Jon Arryn’s suspicions? We know Cersei has no real network of spies from her later chapters. Someone fed her information. I’m excluding Littlefinger as he took matters into his own hands, there was no need for him to inform Cersei.

From the show, especially Season 8, and the books I list some 

* Observe that…
* But why?
* It doesn’t make any sense!

Then I offer *one* word that answers all of them. If not exactly ‘answers’, at least helps better understand or see an exciting development where previously there was only gloom, despair, or improbable stupidity. Even if you disagree with my interpretation, I hope you would find it impressive that so much can be explained by *one* name. 

## Faceless Men

Faceless Men – who is their prime target? 

Faceless Men game ‘tell me a lie’ – why is it a part of their training? Why is it so thorough? Whom are they ultimately trying to fool? A statement made by the true master of their game should be undistinguishable from truth even for somebody who could go *inside* the mind of a Faceless Man.

Why is it so important to become No One? 

1. Article 1 of Faceless Men constitution: **Every man has a right to die.** How would they feel about somebody who doesn’t show any inclination of dying anytime soon?
2. Article 2 of Faceless Men constitution: **Every man has a right to live in freedom.** How would they feel about an *enslaver*? 

&gt;I am Arya Stark and I am going home to Winterfell.

Except, she didn’t go home to Winterfell. The Faceless Man was smiling – he was happy because Arya made a statement undistinguishable from the truth. Whether because Arya was silently adding *‘just not right away’*, Jesuit style, or some other technique, it doesn’t matter. She has completed her training. 

&gt;I am going West of Westeros

The announced plans hardly ever materialize on the show or in the books. And now suddenly Arya remembers a throw-back line from Season 6? 

Whom is she misleading? Somebody who would know that she *did* say that once? But she didn’t tell about it to anybody. So, how would anybody know? Unless that somebody knows everything regardless. 

Is it the *ultimate lie* she has been training for? The sentences start similar, ""I am going..."" 

## Howland Reed or who else was at Tower of Joy

&gt;Ned’s wraiths moved up beside him, with shadow swords in hand. They were seven against three.

It wasn’t just seven and three, though, was there? There was an observer. Who looked pretty much like a shadow. An observer who wouldn’t even exist unless Reed kills Ser Arthur Dayle.

So, *who killed Arthur Dayle*?

Eddard Stark is an embodiment of honor and chivalry. It is reasonable to expect the same from his friends and companions whom he chose to accompany him to the Tower of Joy. Howland Reed wouldn’t kill Ser Arthur Dayle by stabbing in the back, even if Eddard’s life was in danger, would he? 

## Who kills who?

Tywin Lannister shares responsibility for the killings at Red Wedding even if he didn’t kill a single person there. Whose hand makes the final blow is important, but the book makes it very clear that others are not to be resolved from their guilt. Stannis doesn’t physically kill Renly, yet he is accused of the killing and accepts the verdict. 

*Who kills the Night’s King*? It is Arya’s hand that moves, but whose brain gave the order to move the hand? 

Would you feel better if it wasn’t Jon Snow who *really* killed Daenerys?

Throughout the book we observe a very strong symmetry between Fire and Ice. And yet in killings of their champions, Daenerys and the Night King, the symmetry apparently breaks. Arya kills the Night King? And Jon kills Daenerys? 

Why Fire and Ice *activate* so drastically *at the same time* at the beginning of the books?

What or who are they afraid of? 

Symbols in the cave – they have to mean something, right? Symbols in the snow – they should also mean something, what do you think? In S1, Ep1, we see a circle crossed by a line. In the same scene, we see a head pierced by a spear. Is circle a head, a brain, a mind? Head is somehow important, because a White Walker throws it to the Night Watchman and sends him with a warning.

Somebody who could go into a human’s head would be called a *telepath.* Preston Jacobs is not always wrong.

The very first Point-of-View chapter – check the name on it.

&gt;Yet our way is the older way. The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.

We don’t see too many characters following this advice, do we? What is the importance of that, then? Is it that somebody who should be following this principle - does not? Is somebody murdering by other people’s hands? 

Why people in Winterfell are not excited about Daenerys? Dragons rarely come North and the few times they did are well documented and remembered. In the beginning, Bran is excitedly waiting for the king’s train to arrive, and all we got was essentially a fat old dude on a horse. Now we have a beautiful queen with a famous name arriving on two dragons with Dothraki and Unsullied from exciting exotic places – and nobody in Winterfell seem to really care. People loved Daenerys in Essos. People were amazed by Targaryens and Dragons in Westeros before. Why not now, not in Winterfell? 

Is there something wrong with people of Winterfell?

Well, is there something wrong with people of Westeros? Daenerys seemed to think so. 

## Characters acting out-of-character

After Winterfell, our characters seem a bit off. 

* Varys is talking with Tyrion in a big room, essentially in the open. He is trying to convince Jon Snow literally in the open, with anybody to see. He is writing and sending letters that are unlikely to have the effect he desires, but very likely to have the effect he dreads.
* Tyrion actions seem illogical.
* After several nights at Winterfell, Jaime suddenly realizes that he loves Cersei and has to be back at KL. All tangible outcome his action achieves is to be captured, released by Tyrion, and thus contributing to Daenerys’ feeling of betrayal. 

Rhaegal is hit by three consecutive shots. Yet all attempts in the next episode against a bigger dragon fail to find the mark. Was somebody improving Euron’s abilities to kill Rhaegal? 

Was somebody mentally interfering with Scorpion shooters’ attempts to kill Drogon? 

Tyrion speeches are mentioned several times. On several occasions Tyrion is trying to persuade:

* Slavemasters to end the war
* His own sister to join the war
* Twice
* Qyburn
* Cersei again, not to execute the hostage, killing whom is not in Cersei’s interests anyway, because it doesn’t help her situation.

Tyrion *fails* on all those occasions. The *only time* his speech *works* is when he is trying to convince Jon Snow to kill Daenerys. Did somebody help Tyrion to write that speech?

## Characters act as if they are losing their memory

&gt;It’s not that what happened two minutes ago matters anymore. (From some Season 7 episode review by Preston Jacobs)

Unsullied really want to kill and destroy KL. Yet in the next episode they are happily strolling through the city, quite content.

The same applies to Dothraki.

Asha/Yara apparently forgot the pact with Daenerys and that her own goal was Iron Islands independence. For generations it was, the key motivation for her father’s actions. 

Tyrion explains to Jon Snow that he loves Daenerys, too. Yet twenty minutes later he doesn’t seem particularly grief stricken. 

It is as if somebody *erased* Daenerys from people’s memory entirely. 

Hmm, who have access to people minds and memories? Who, in fact, claims that he *is* the memory? 

If your memory is somewhere else or is *somebody else* it is no longer *your* memory, is it? If you upload a file to Dropbox and then erase it, what happens if Dropbox decides that you are better off if the file is to be, well, gone and forgotten? 

## Why everybody is so happy, crazy, or happily crazy? 

Tyrion wins that round by insisting to share his joke with the new Small Council. And appointing Bronn the Master of Coin. 

\&gt; And with proper advisers, she never will be \[her father\].

Yet Varys deserts his advising duties, and so does Tyrion – is it any wonder that things go wrong with Daenerys? When the two people who last season insisted that she needs the right advisers decide to no longer advise her? 

How does Tyrion react to all his failures and betrayals? Oh, he is telling jokes and thinking about brothels. 

I thought there was something between Tyrion and Sansa – I swear Episode 3 created that impression. Never mind, apparently she wants to be in the North and Tyrion is quite happy back to King’s Landing. 

Everybody is happy and crazy at the same time – except surviving Starks.

* Jon looks puzzled and perplexed at what happened. He honestly doesn’t understand what just happened and why he did what he did. Debatable. But one thing certain – he doesn’t look happy.
* Arya is actually crying for Jon. Arya. Crying. Is it because she understands what just happened and *who* did it?
* Sansa acts quite rationally. I suspect she understands who is pulling the strings, but doesn’t care. She is not willing to do anything about it.

Arya might. She is not going west of Westeros, is she? She needs somebody to think she does. 

So, why Starks are not affected by overall madness? Is it because their telepathic abilities effectively protect them from a telepathic meddling, especially if the meddler is somehow related to them?

## And other things

Why suddenly Alys Rivers’ story looks so important now? See my lo-o-ong write up at [https://fractal-affinity.com/got/c19/Alys%20Rivers.html](https://fractal-affinity.com/got/c19/Alys%20Rivers.html) Why didn’t Martin finish her story in Fire &amp; Blood, Part 1? What was Jaqen H’ghar’s assignment? Why he spends so much time around Harrenhal? Is it because of somebody like Alys Rivers but much more powerful? 

Why most powerful *entity* on Westeros is apparently doing nothing?   
Is it actually doing *everything*? 

Who says he is not what people call him? 

Who has died, yet not many noticed, and we refused to accept it and still are? 

Why does it matter where Drogon is flying? 

Why leave unanswered questions in the last episode of the last season of the show? 

Unless it is not the last episode? Or not the last season? Or, perhaps, HBO was honest with us and it *is* the *last* episode of the *last* season of the *show* – but they wanted to do a Game of Thrones *movie,* for a while, didn’t they? 

Who is the final boss of Game of Thrones, the movie?

ANYWAYYY...Idk, is there some website or something that I can read along with to make the experience better? I'm not the best at remembering character names and places and stuff like that and from the few sample chapters I read on Kindle, it seems like GRRM is super duper extremely complex in the way he writes and it makes me feel overwhelmed.

Doesn't help that my attention span sucks and there's a void in my soul after the ending of season 8. So I was told to check the books out to fill this gaping hole in my heart. And now my watch begins. 👀

I mean its absolutely massive so its pretty difficult to be graceful and to move your blade around a lot. But its supposedly not that heavy for swords as its valyrian steel especially as most Lord Starks who wield it have most likely trained in arms since birth. On the other hand, in the press of a melee its almost impossible to not get it caught on something unless your pretty tall.

Just some thoughts would be appreciated thanks.

354,"  For the last several months or so I have taken my passion and obsession for ASOIAF and turned it towards the American Civil War. My interest in the Civil War era first began back in High School when I took an AP US History class with a wonderful teacher but it was entirely renewed again after I noticed a single connection between Jon Snow and Abraham Lincoln within George's writing. I have been pouring through audio books on the Civil War for awhile now. I have made several posts about Lincoln and ASOIAF in the past as I noticed them and I greatly appreciated the responses I received so I decided that I wanted to make a new post to summarize some of those previous thoughts and share a few new ones. In my opinion, George is so good at pulling inspiration from different places for singular characters that it can be hard to say for sure where his ideas come from. It's become very clear to me now that he likes to pull from fiction and non-fiction sources alike. A couple weeks ago I went back with some of my expanded knowledge on the Civil War and reread George's book about vampires, Fevre Dream. I was absolutely blown away my second time through this story by all of the details that went over my head the first time through. I am now convinced that it is a masterpiece of a story and I was fairly jubilant when I realized Fevre Dream takes place right before and right after the Civil War. Fevre Dream has now persuaded me that not only does George have extensive knowledge on this time period in American history but it has also convinced me that ASOIAF is not even the first time George has incorporated characteristics of Abraham Lincoln into one of his protagonists.

(I don't want to spoil Fevre Dream for anyone who has yet to read it but I would be happy to elaborate on the story if anyone is interested. For now I will stick to ASOIAF.)

There are a whole bunch of little details I've been curious about between the Civil War and ASOIAF but by far and away the strongest comparisons I have found in George's writing relate to Abraham Lincoln, the legendary President, and Jon Snow, the rightful ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Let me try to explain why Jon and Abraham have a lot in common:

To begin with, they are both described as melancholic or with similar words (which is a nice way of saying bittersweet). They also both seem to have paradoxical qualities to their appearance. Jon is described with the brooding long face of the Starks and he is compared to Ned specifically (Ned isn't considered attractive). Later on, Jon's face is referred to as being sweet by Ygritte . Lincoln himself was described as being so ugly he was beautiful and it was stated that his face had an element of tenderness. Jon was born in Southern Westeros and he was raised in the North. In America, Lincoln was born in the South and raised in the North. Both Jon and Lincoln experienced prophetic dreams throughout their lives and they both spent time visiting family at the crypts. They both had to grow up without their mother, who despite her absence was still able to play a major and mysterious role in their identity. At a young age Lincoln joined the Illinois militia to take part in the Black Hawk War. Having no military experience, Lincoln was immediately elected captain after proving his physical strength and his qualities of leadership to his men. Lincoln was mustered in and out twice during the short war and he ended his service working in an independent spy company. I think this brief time in Lincoln's life is mirrored well by Jon's quick rise in the Night's Watch and the turn of events that led to his espionage among the Freefolk. While Jon was drawn to leave home and serve the realm at the Wall, Lincoln was drawn to leave home and serve the public by practicing law. Lincoln and Jon Snow both experienced the death of their first love which made a major impact on who they became. Lincoln and Jon were both nominated to positions of leadership in spectacular fashion as dark horse candidates. Both Jon's choosing as Lord Commander and Lincoln's Republican nomination for president in 1860 Chicago involved some back-room dealing. During his Presidency, Lincoln evolved his opinions on slavery as the war progressed. Meanwhile, Jon evolved his opinions on the Freefolk as the threat of the Others was revealed to him (I like to think the Others present a supernatural threat of slavery). While Lincoln used the American Declaration of Independence to defend his beliefs of the equality of the slaves as citizens, Jon utilized the Night's Watch vows in similar fashion to back his decisions. He concluded that the Freefolk were equally a part of the realm of men as defined in the vows of the Night's Watch. Lincoln made the slaves free under the law and Jon saved the Freefolk by bringing them to other side of the Wall. After the Civil war ended, Lincoln gave only one speech on reconstruction before he was assassinated in a conspiracy. Jon gave only one speech on restoring House Stark before he was assassinated in a conspiracy. Lastly, this is more speculative, but I think their is a symbolic connection between Jon Snow and Abraham Lincoln as corn kings. I think Jon's role as a corn king is still being revealed in ASOIAF but Lincoln's life had come to an end in 1865. When Lincoln was first nominated for President, Southerners burned wicker effigies of him to protest his election. Shortly after the war ended, Lincoln was shot in the back of the head at point blank range around 10pm. Somehow, he managed to stay alive throughout the entire long night with his injury until the dawn of April 14th when he passed away. His death was very close to the end of the Winter and the beginning of Spring. At one point Lincoln even referred to the Civil War itself as ""the long winter"" and he perished only after seeing it through to the end. His body was carried by train on a long funeral procession through the blooming Spring fields and forests of the country. Season 8 Epsiode 1, where Jon learns his true identity for the first time actually aired on April 14th, the anniversary of Lincoln's assassination. I thought this fact was really interesting but maybe it doesn't mean anything.

Moving forward now, I wanted to point out a few more Lincoln-like qualities or events that I have noticed around other important characters:

**Daenerys** \- Dany's role as mother (Mhysa Mhysa) to the liberated slaves of Meereen reminds me a lot of ""Father Abraham"" and his journey among the freed slaves in the conquered city of Richmond.

**Ned Stark** \- one of the earliest casualties of the Civil War was Lincoln's close and personal friend Edward Baker who he affectionately called Ned. This death hit Lincoln very hard and he nearly collapsed in the street. Lincoln had many responsibilities as President but one of his jobs was to oversee the execution of all kinds of war criminals and traitors. He handled this role of overseeing executions with a grave and somber attitude. He prevented hundreds of deaths whenever it was within in his power to stop them. I think this theme of justice and executions is critical to Jon Snow's story as well.

**Mance Rayder** \- when Jon Snow first meets Mance Rayder, the King Beyond the Wall, he has just finishing uniting all of the Freefolk for the first time in Planetos history. Jon precedes to listen to Mance perform a song from the Southernmost kingdom of Westeros, which is Dorne. Immediately following the end of the Civil War when news reached Washington of Lee's surrender, instead of giving a speech Lincoln directed a band to play the Southern anthem ""Dixie"". He had his mind set on the reunification of the nation and he wanted to remind everyone of the bonds that tied them together. Dixie was well liked North and South before the Confederacy adopted it to their cause.

**Tyrion and Samwell** \- Tyrion's quote about his mind being a weapon almost sounds identical to something Lincoln would have said. Tyrion and Sam's dedication to reading and the general acquisition of knowledge reminds me a lot of Lincoln's personality.

And now just for fun I wanted to share a few small details I've been thinking about pertaining to the Civil War era:

* Jon's Snow's usurpation of Mance Rayder's leadership reminds me a lot of William H. Seward relationship with Abraham. Lincoln defeated Seward in the Republican nomination in spectacular fashion as I mentioned above but Lincoln went right ahead and made his rival Secretary of State. Seward had ultimately lost the election to Lincoln because he was too pro-abolition for the country as a whole but he sucked up his defeat and worked incredibly hard under Lincoln's leadership. They became very close friends.
* Mance Rayder = Emancipator in my opinion. William Seward did more than anyone else to unite the Republican party while Mance did more than anyone else to unite the Freefolk.
* I think Castle Black is a great opposite to the White House
* Another member of Lincoln's cabinet was Edward Bates. Bates tells a strange and interesting story in his journal about a frog that jumped onto his wife's pregnant belly. Their son was then apparently born with a frog-shaped birthmark. This is totally random but it really made me think about Bloodraven and his peculiar birthmark.
* Dolorous Edd reminds me a lot of Lincoln's well-liked Secretary of War Edwin Stanton who was very good at his job but had an incredibly gloomy personality due to a number of tragedies in his family
* Stannis Baratheon reminds me of a combination of two people from the era. First being Jefferson Davis who led the Confederacy with gritted teeth and grim determination against near impossible odds. The second person is John Brown who became known as the ""Meteor of the War"". John Brown believed he was chosen by God to lead the slaves to freedom and his decision to attempt and armed insurrection led to the death of innocent people as well as his children and himself. His actions incited the passions of the divided nation.
* Renly, strangely enough, reminds me of Stonewall Jackson. Stonewall Jackson loved the glory of battle but he was also a gardener. He was known to eat peaches from his own garden while riding his horse around the battlefield. Jackson was accidentally killed by his own men while Renly was killed by his own brother.
* Tywin Lannister's relationship with his father and his lifelong dedication to being a different kind of man is very similar to the relationship of Rober E. Lee and his father. Lee's father was disgraced due to gambling debts and I believe alcoholism but, nonetheless, Lee made a commitment to be the opposite of his father in a very similar fashion to the disturbed head of the lions.

On a final note, I just wanted to end by saying that I am always impressed with George's ability to name his characters. I think even this characteristic in itself ties well to Lincoln as he was so aptly named. It was quoted many times by many different people that Abraham was like a father to the soldiers and citizens of the Union. The meaning and origin of the name Abraham translates to ""Father of Many"". I have always wondered specifically what it was about Jon Snow that I liked so much after my discovery of the series and I think I have found my answer within parallels to the famous President. As I have read more and more about Lincoln and the Civil War I have found that my passion for Jon Snow has easily multiplied and transmuted into compassion and even reverence for the true living legend that was Honest Abe.

356,"tl;dr Dany going mad has so many unfortunate implications &amp; there may be a different ending for her + D&amp;D ain't shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I joined reddit just to write this post, though I’ve been checking certain subreddits from time to time.

I wanted to write this because I find it surprising how much people expect, or even root, for Daenerys to go mad.

She is my favourite character so of course I’m biased here, but I think that an ending like this would send a lot of unpleasant messages, my sympathies towards her aside.

&amp;#x200B;

If George decides that Dany should go mad, I will accept it. It’s his story, he’s allowed to do whatever he wants with it. However, I will be extremely disappointed if this is what he’s heading for.

Because let’s think for a second. Let's check how she started the story and how she could end it.

&amp;#x200B;

The first time we see Dany, she is a frightened child under her cruel brother’s thumb. In Dany’s very first chapter, we learn that Viserys sexually, emotionally and physically abuses her.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;His fingers brushed lightly over her budding breasts and tightened on a nipple. “You will not fail me tonight. If you do, it will go hard for you.    
&gt;  
&gt;You don’t want to wake the dragon, do you?” His fingers twisted her, the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her tunic. “Do you?” he repeated.

&amp;#x200B;

He marries her off to a foreigner twice her age (I think it’s good to remember that Dany is THIRTEEN. Even Viserys wonders if it’s not too early) and tells her that he wouldn’t mind her being raped forty thousand times if it means he gets an army. In ADWD we even learn that he wished to rape her before he gave her to Drogo.

Dany is then raped by her husband (yes, in the books as well):

&gt;Yet every night, some time before the dawn, Drogo would come to her tent and wake her in the dark, to ride her as relentlessly as he rode his stallion. He always took her from behind, Dothraki fashion, for which Dany was grateful; that way her lord husband could not see the tears that wet her face, and she could use her pillow to muffle **her cries of pain.**

Dany eventually adapts to the Dothraki ways, gets indenpendent from Viserys and no longer fears him.

We are getting to the moment that people love to call the „foreshadowing” for Dany’s mad queens turn. I mean the scene where she didn’t stop Drogo from killing Viserys. The showrunners said that this was a „chilling” reaction” from her. Let’s look at what Viserys did just before he got himself killed.

&gt;He laid the point of his sword between Daenerys’s breasts and slid it downward, over the curve of her belly. “I want what I came for,” he told her. “I want the crown he promised me. He bought you, but he never paid for you. Tell him I want what I bargained for, or I’m taking you back. You and the eggs both. He can keep his bloody foal. I’ll cut the bastard out and leave it for him.” The sword point pushed through her silks and pricked at her navel. Viserys was weeping, she saw; weeping and laughing, both at the same time, this man who had once been her brother.

Not only he’s been sexually, emotionally and physically abusing her for years. Now he literally **THREATENED THAT HE WILL CUT HER BELLY OPEN AND MURDER HER CHILD.**

Put yourself in Dany’s shoes for a second and think if you’d plead to the child’s father to spare him. I wouldn’t.

&amp;#x200B;

This gets me to the second ""foreshadowing"" of the ""madness"": Dany supposedly shrugging Viserys off and never thinking about him again. Wrong.

&gt;You have not laughed since your brother the Khal Rhaggat was crowned by Drogo,” said Irri. “It is good to see, Khaleesi.”Dany smiled shyly. It was sweet to laugh. She felt half a girl again.

&amp;#x200B;

Dany stopped laughing after Viserys was killed. 

If this isn’t sufficient for you to believe that she was AT LEAST conflicted about his death, this should:

&gt;„The cream-and-gold I call Viserion. Viserys was cruel and weak and frightened, yet he was my brother still. His dragon will do what he could not.""

She calls her dragon after Viserys. She honors her brother by naming her „child” after him. 

She thinks about him again in ASOS.

&gt;Viserys had been stupid andvicious, she had come to realize, yet sometimes she missed him all the same. Not the cruel weak man hehad become by the end, but the brother who had sometimes let her creep into his bed, the boy who toldher tales of the Seven Kingdoms, and talked of how much better their lives would be once he claimed his crown.

This gives us some insight into Viserys’ character as well. I think he did care about Dany, at least at the beginning, but the hardships he endured caused him to lash out on Dany and hurt her. Dany’s relationship with Viserys lines perfectly with what it’s like to be in an abusive relationship. It’s hard to let them go. Sometimes you wish you could have them back. They aren’t always monsters, sometimes they treat you kindly, other times they say they wouldn’t mind if you were raped forty thousand times.

You may wonder why it took me so long to describe Viserys' abuse, what it means for Dany, why it's so important in her story. All of this leads me to my final point:

Imagine if Viserys never died. Imagine if Dany has never gotten her dragons. In this case, she would never conquer Yunkai, Astapor and Meereen, she would never free slaves. And (if this is what George intends), would never go mad.

But if she does go mad, do you know what this implies?

**That it was better for her to be abused by her brother. It was better for her to be raped by her husband. It was better for her to be a meek, scared little girl. It was better for her to be abused than to get power. And if you don't mourn your abuser's death, you're just as bad as them, and you will inevitably go mad because of it.**

Dany being Aerys’ daughter, and turning into the mad queen, gives us another unpleasant message. **That is, children always eventually become their parents. If your parents are cruel, crazy, pyromaniac abusers, you will become one too.** And let me say this, as a person who was abused by my parents, this is my worst fear. That I will turn out to be them.

Another message is that you should not root for a character who tries to change the world they live in, because untimately, they are wrong, and they should be punished.

Oh, and mental illness will always make you a cruel tyrant.

This has gotten quite long, so I will not discuss her other signs of „madness”, since I have an entirely different point to make. I want you all to consider a possibility that there might be an other ending for Daenerys, that does not involve her becoming a mad queen, though from an outsider’s point of view, it may seem like it.

And I mean the casks of wildfire underneath the King’s Landing.

Aerys placed them there and only a handful of people know about them. So now let’s imagine that you’re Dany. After her last ADWD chapter, she is ready to take a much darker turn. I fully believe that Dany will fly to King’s Landing, ready to burn the Red Keep with Cersei/FAegon inside, not willing to harm innocents… and then all these casks of wildfire will explode.

Dany will have no idea about those, obviously, but she will still be responsible for it. It will be a pure accident, but it will be something that will change her as a character. It will be what leads her to the war with the Others, because she will want to redeem herself after this horrific accident.

And, to others, she may seem like a mad queen for what she did.

&amp;#x200B;

Many of you believe that Dany went mad in the show because George told D&amp;D about it. But then I need you all to remember that these are the same men who wrote the whole wight hunt from season 7 **because they wanted an ice bear**. And who said (I don’t remember what this was about) the famous quote: „creatively it made sense because we wanted it to happen”.

So if they wanted to make a final \~shocking twist\~, they didn’t need George’s direction for it. They just went for it, to SuBvErT eXpEcTaTiOns.

I hope that I managed to convince at least a handful of people. I must say, I just don’t want her to go mad. That’s all. Maybe I’m just reaching and in denial, but I just can’t stand this idea.",asoiaf
357,"/u/elio_garcia and Linda made two videos discussing the endgame of Game of Thrones and how they relate to the books. After the first one was released, HBO gave that interview with Isaac where he claimed that King Bran comes from GRRM. That is why they did a second video to further discuss the question of Bran specifically.

In the [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv92rBaiVbI), there are time stamps where you can watch their views on the endgame of particular characters. Regarding King Bran, they see serious problems with it, at least in the way it was played out in the show:

1. The secession of the North while the rest of Westeros bows to King Bran does not make any sense at all.

1. In the books, Bran will be a lot younger than the one in the show.

1. In the books, Bran is someone isolated from the rest of the story since ACoK and it is still a mystery how he will be reintroduced to the main action and get involved with the rest of the big cast.

1. In the books, a kingsmoot like council for electing the monarch requires not just the council of surviving characters. There number of voting lords should be much higher.

1. Elio is still skeptical of Bran ever leaving the cave in the books (though I disagree here because GRRM is clearly setting up Gorne’s Way, which is the only way Bran can return south). According to him, Bran will be the last greenseer on a weirwood throne, interacting with people through dreams and such and that is the kind of king he might be.

Then they discuss why D&amp;D might have changed GRRM’s ending (assuming they did) to write King Bran into the show. According to them, there might be several reasons for this:

1. D&amp;D did not like GRRM’s endgame king.

1. GRRM’s endgame king does not exist in the books yet (like a child that will be born later)

1. GRRM’s endgame king is a person they discounted and/or killed in the show.

Then they discuss how hard it is for GRRM to pass time in the books and whether there needs to be a time jump somewhere but then they decide that age is not the only problem for King Bran or another child king. The basic problem is that no one would back Bran unless he does something incredible like saving the world and everyone knowing and appreciating it. They ridicule the notion of Bran’s election because “he has the best story”. Unless GRRM starts talking about a new time jump like taking place after TWoW, they don’t see him going for King Bran. Elio is favorable with the idea of Bran becoming a greenseer king on a weirwood throne, king of the children of the forest, king beyond the Wall etc. but they don’t see Bran being the king of men.

Elio argues that the only foreshadowing for Bran is the weirwood throne and his story does not have anything to do with the Iron Throne. Linda points that even if they kill an awful lot of people in the future, a pure Stark being a claimant to the Iron Throne does not work in the books; nor do they find the idea of elective monarchy likely in the books. They don't believe GRRM is retreading Dune with the god-king Bran. They don't think King Bran was properly set up in the show.

The second video has a lot more stuff to discuss but perhaps in another thread.",asoiaf
358,Just wondering since I really want to see/hear about their history! I saw the Targ. Conquest on a YouTube video (narrated by Vyserys and more characters) and it was very entertaining.

359,"I'm just wrapping up listening to the first book, within the last few hours and Maester Luwin is explaining the story of the Children of the Forest and the First Men to Bran. 

The Children of the Forest once populated most of present-day Westeros, until The First Men came and went to war with them to take it for themselves. The Children of the Forest would use leaves instead of armor to help camouflage them into the landscape. The Children had a more intimate connection with nature and trees and magic. Finally, the Children and First Men made a truce to co-exist, but over the centuries, the Children have mostly died out and whoever remains was pushed north. 

I was listening to an interview with GRRM where he was talking about how he often uses real world events to map onto his fantasy world. He spoke of how the Faith of the Seven was mostly inspired by with real-world Catholicism and how the faith of the old gods is mostly inspired by Paganism. It felt to me that there exists a similar mapping between the story of real-world Native Americans and the Children of the Forest.",asoiaf
360,"I was re-reading ACOK and noticed that Arya was practicing in the Harrenhal godswood. Unlike most of the other Riverland castles, Harrenhal actually boast of having a living weirwood heart tree, complete with carved faces, red leaves and everything else.

If so, why would he still keep an embodiment of the Old God in his castle when he had already committed sacrilege against them in the first place?",asoiaf
361,"I've been re-reading AGoT after completing the whole series a few years ago and I just finished Tyrion's trial by combat, and on a second read through it really struck me just how terrible Cat and Lysa are.

First, the letter from Lysa that Cat burned. In the chapter she receives it she reads and burns it before telling Ned what it says. She tells Ned that her sister said that ""the Lannisters"" killed Jon Arryn. In one of her POV chapters at the Eyrie she recalls that the letter explicitly blamed *Cersei* individually and not the Lannisters collectively.

And in Lysa's last chapter in ASoS, she tells Petyr and therefore us, that she poisoned Jon Arryn. In AGoT she acts fearful that Cat brought Tyrion to the Eyrie, and then in the trial scenes she acts like she believes Tyrion is responsible for Jon's death when she knows *for a fact* that he isn't.

And of course Cat blames Tyrion for the attack on Bran even though she has no proof and he had no motive, because Littlefinger lied and told Cat that he lost the dagger to Tyrion after Tyrion bet against Jamie in a tournament. And neither Cat nor Lysa even tells Tyrion or anybody *why* they believe Tyrion assaulted Bran or *why* they believe Tyrion killed Jon Arryn.

Why didn't they say anything? Because again, *they both knew he was innocent of both accusations.* They were both prepared to either kill Tyrion or let him die, and Cat was willing to start a war against the Lannisters while her husband was surrounded by Lannisters over abducting, imprisoning, and nearly kiling a man she *knew* to be innocent!",asoiaf

363,"After the threats of Ice and Fire are dealt with, we'll undoubtedly get a much longer aftermath in the books than in the last episode of Game of Thrones, and I suspect we'll get a ""Scouring of the Shire"" segment with Littlefinger as the villain.

I believe Cersei is not long for this world and Aegon VI will be King by the time Dany invades, and Euron is fully tied to the ""Ice"" plot, potentially playing the role taken by the Night King in the TV series. Littlefinger however, as a completely human agent who has been causing mayhem since the very beginning and isn't tied to either of the Ice of Fire threads, will linger on to act as the bookend.

The TV writers gave Littlefinger an underwhelming end Barristan style to be rid of a character and an actor who needs paying, and it didn't land because it came early and in the midst of much bigger storylines. His death in the books will probably occur in a similar manner but carry more weight because the supernatural threats are already dealt with and it's symbolic of resolving events that were set in motion at the very beginning, providing a sense of symmetry.",asoiaf

After Drogo becomes basically borderline comatose and Dany wakes up after her miscarriage, she finds out that the Khalasar is gone and the strongest Ko's of Drogo have declared themselves new Khals. 

Why did they leave her there?, by rights shouldn't she have been taken to Vaes Dothrak as a Khal's widow or killed for fucking up Drogo with bloodmagic?

367,"I just read the first 120 or so pages of the first book for the first time and I'm absolutely hooked.  I have already watched the show in its entirety and despite its disappointing ending I still love it and the story as a whole so this reading experience has been incredible.  I could go on and on about how much my enjoyment of the story is being enhanced by all of the little details and background information and character moments, but I have a few details in particular that stood out to me and really resonated that I wanted to share:

&amp;#x200B;

* When Tyrion and Jon speak on their way to the wall I found it noteworthy that Tyrion is reading a book about dragons, obviously, in my mind, this was a cool possible foreshadowing of Jons identity.  
* I was pretty surprised at just how brutal Catelyns hatred for Jon is in the books so far.  She seemed cold to him in the show, but she is genuinely cruel to him in the books.  Was not expecting that.
* Tyrion's description of the Field of Fire genuinely has me hoping they bring it to life on screen one day.  I have always heard people mention this battle when reading comments on the Spoils of War episode from the show, but reading about it in detail for the first time definitely has me interested in not just that battle, but Aegon and his sisters as a whole.

Again, there are so many small moments and details that enrich the story that I wasnt expecting.  Makes me wish we could get a well done animated series that could put as much of this story on screen as possible.  Thanks for entertaining my thoughts and I hope to check in if I find anything else interesting to share!",asoiaf
368,"While I was rereading the hedge knight, I got very curious about Aerion “Brightflame” Targaryan. It seems that George had originally intended for him to be a larger presence in the main series, and possibly was intended for young griff to be his descendant (only to eventually be overshadowed by the blackfire plot).

 

His coat of arms struck me as particularly curious. A three-headed dragon: one head red, one head yellow, and one head orange. Where on earth did those colours come from? 

 

Well we know that Aerion, like his brothers, was plagued by dragon dreams. I think it is possible that Areion dreamed of the birth of Danny’s dragons specifically, with the colour of the dragon heads on his sigil matching up with the eye/horn colour of each of Danny’s dragons. The dragons are described as such in the books:

 

Drogon: Black scales, with red eyes and horns (the red head)

Viscerion: White scales with golden eyes and horns (the yellow head)

Rhaegal: Green scales with bronze eyes (the orange head)

 

Given the nature of dragon dreams, it is possible that in his dreams the dragons heads alone were these colours, symbolizing the different eye colours of Danny’s dragons.

 

As he has this coat of arms as early as “the hedge Knight”, it is likely that this has been a recurring dream throughout his life. This culminated in his death by drinking wildfire believing that it would turn him into a dragon. Aerion likely saw himself as the saviour of his family, and all of westeros, bringing the rebirth of dragons (which probably didnt help with his ego)",asoiaf

370,"An oft-repeated criticism of S8E6 has been that Bran's government is bound to collapse almost immediately. Multiple High Lords on the council have reason to secede, especially in light of Sansa's announcement that the North is going to do just that. Another complaint is that it's effectively a Stark coup.

However, I'd argue that these assertions don't go far enough. Bran's government isn't merely about to collapse, it's completely impotent from day one. The other lords don't secede because there's no point; Bran's government effectively creates seven independent kingdoms.

# The Inception

The other High Lords show up because of the threat of Daenerys' army. They are battle-hardened, have taken multiple cities, and even before they arrived in Westeros had a reputation for fierceness (""A DOTHRAKI HORDE ON AN OPEN FIELD""). Along with the Starks' army, they *could* be a real threat.

However, it quickly becomes obvious that the Dothraki and the Unsullied aren't there to play the game of thrones, and they aren't on friendly terms with the Starks. Rather, they're only there to act as stewards and ensure a peaceful transition of power in honor of Daenerys' memory.

This leaves the Starks. The Starks' army is the second most powerful force in KL, and the Council of Lords is chock full of Starks or Stark supporters. It's patently unfair, but the Starks also have their whole army there.

But then a very curious thing happens. Tyrion, the traitor to Westeros demeans Bran with the moniker ""the Broken"". Bran's sister utterly humiliates Bran in front of everyone there by announcing that he's loosing blanks - or not loosing at all. And Bran, heir to Winterfell, the man who ought to be liege lord of the army that just massacred King's Landing does...absolutely nothing about it. Tyrion blathers about Bran being a storyteller, rulers being chosen. Well, everybody is stuck going along with it, because of the implication (that the Starks might murder everybody under a flag of truce, like they did to King's Landing).

But then an even more curious thing happens. Bran's sister announces that she's taking the North independent...and now things start to come into focus. See, this means Bran doesn't have an army. On top of that, Tyrion is appointed as his Hand. A man whose own house hates him, who most recently sided with a foreign army that massacred a major city center, who somehow got their army to hate him too.

So of course nobody says anything. What's obviously happened is that Sansa (who wants to be undisputed ruler of the North) and Tyrion (who just wants to be left alone) have set up a nominal central government, with no power. There is nothing in King's Landing and nobdy appointed to the government has any power. The tit-for-tat that's in effect is that Sansa is getting autonomy in exchange for arranging the same for every other kingdom.

In essence, Bran's position is now analogous to the position of the Queen of England, but with even less of a role in practical government.

# Small Council

**Bran (King)**

In the face of the undead apocalypse, Bran does jack squat to help and spends all his time silently watching the living get massacred. He mostly sits around staring at people or vegging out on the Weirwood trees. In a feast full of lords and warriors, he makes small talk about wheelchairs instead of relating firsthand accounts of landmark sociopolitical events and battles thousands of years ago. He has intensely negative charisma, telling his sister how beautiful she looked the night she was raped. Bran is definitely not going to inspire anybody to follow him with the storytelling choices he makes.

**Tyrion (Hand)**

The Westerlands hate Tyrion for murdering Tywin. The North (Sansa) doesn't trust Tyrion for his ""divided loyalties"". Dorne probably isn't a big fan since Oberyn died defending him. Tyrion's brother was the last threat menacing the Riverlands. His sister deposed the King from the Stormlands. He foisted Bronn as nominal ruler of Highgarden. The Iron Islands' perspective is entirely unclear.

In short, Tyrion isn't bringing any major house support to the table.

**Bronn (Master of Coin)**

Doesn't know how loans work. Foisted upon Highgarden by Tyrion despite absolutely zero connection with them. Highgarden was previously ransacked of everything of value by the Lannisters, who probably killed most of the key people as well. Bronn might be the only person left in the castle, and presumably doesn't actually have anybody personally loyal to him in Highgarden.

Bronn is probably just around because there aren't any battles for him to profit off of, and Tyrion needs a friend.

**Davos (Master of Ships)**

Davos' house is practically just his wife and kids. He backed Stannis, who murdered his daughter. Then he backed Jon Snow, who was a part of the King's Landing massacre before murdering their Queen. Davos was never that influential, and apart from people in the Stormlands who decided not to support or who abandoned Stannis, probably doesn't know many people of influence.

Davos is probably mostly there for the exposure and resume-building.

**Sam (""Grand"" ""Maester"")**

Double quotation marks for emphasis. Not only is Sam not even a Maester, he's definitely not a Grand Maester. He stole priceless books, quite possibly unique and irreplaceable ones, from the Citadel. The Maesters have such an ivory tower complex going on, it's likely he wouldn't even be allowed back in the Citadel, let alone brought into their inner circle. Hopefully Sam looks back fondly on his Night's Watch days, because sending ravens is probably going to be his only job again.

He's probably there mostly as an excuse to look at whatever cool toys from Qyburn survived Daenerys' rampage, especially since he's not allowed in the Citadel library and read all the books he stole.

**Brienne (Head of the Kingsguard)**

Brienne was always sort of an outcaste due to her ""unladylike"" aspirations. While she might be able to muster some support from her own House Tarth, she has always focused on being a knight rather than amassing influence.

She's probably mostly there because Sansa asked her to take care of Bran, and it's nominally fulfilling what she always wanted.

**Pod (Kingsguard)**

Pod was, up until recently, a squire. His main claim to fame is his prowess in the bedroom, which is somewhat negated by the Kingsguard's [purported chastity](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/The_Kingsguard).

He's probably mostly there out of loyalty to Brienne.

# So what is this government?

It's a pretense.

First, it gets Bran out of Winterfell. That leaves Sansa as the rightful heir. Bran's kicked upwards, but he hasn't got any jurisdiction over the North.

Second, it sets up a completely ineffectual government in what is now the middle of nowhere. Everybody in King's Landing is dead, the city has been destroyed by out-of-control dragonfire and wildfire. The only person with the background to be there is Tyrion, and he doesn't even want to be there and makes only a token effort to actually do his job. He spends about as much time rearranging chairs as they do discussing business. Overall, all they really accomplish is deciding to fix the loo, a book report by Sam, a token appearance by Bran, and arguing a bit about whether to build brothels in a city which looks like a reenactment of post-Vesuvius Pompeii. No one is entirely serious. After a grand total of four minutes, Tyrion is done for the day and starts telling brothel stories.

Third, it prevents the appearance of radical change while actually delegating all power to the individual Kingdoms. Sansa's implicit promise, in exchange for seceding with the North, is that everybody else is getting that too. Sure, Sam can send ravens to tell them their taxes are due, but whose army is he going to send when they don't pay? What small city's worth of financial, political, and legal specialists is Tyrion going to task with the day-to-day minutiae of running a continent-wide government?

Basically, Brienne and Pod are there to take care of Bran while Tyrion, Bronn, Davos, and Sam talk, shoot the breeze, get over their PTSD, and basically do anything *but* ruling. Bran gets peace and quiet to warg all day. After a few weeks, they'll probably all get bored of being the only seven people in a ten square mile radius and decide to ""relocate the capital"" to someplace more fun, like Bronn's house.

374,"In A Clash of Kings, Daenerys has numerous visions within the House of the Undying. Among these are a few notable prophecies, such as the blue flower within the wall (R+L=J), the blue-eyed king with a red sword (likely Stannis), the mummer's dragon (the fAegon theory), and a vision of Rhaegar with Elia Martell. Each of these is quite easily ascribed to something that happens, has happened, or will happen within the story. Each of these is something that us fans have taken to and tried to describe their purpose within the story because all of them are seemingly something actually *in* the story. All but one.

&gt;Then phantoms shivered through the murk, images in indigo. Viserys screamed as the molten gold ran down his cheeks and filled his mouth. A tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair stood beneath the banner of a fiery stallion, a burning city behind him. Rubies flew like drops of blood from the chest of a dying prince, and he sank to his knees in the water and with his last breath murmured a woman's name. . . . mother of dragons, daughter of death . . . 

Here, we can see that all of these in the first set are easily ascribed, and have been, Viserys, Rhaego, and Rhaegar, the three closest Targaryens she has known up to this point. But there's something off. The death of Viserys, what could have been of Rhaego, and the death of Rhaegar. See something strange? Rhaego, of this first set, is the only one that hasn't happened. It's the only one that can't happen. In fact, throughout the entirety of this time of prophecies, the hypothetical reign of Rhaego as the Stallion-Who-Mounts-The-World is the one that cannot happen, metaphorically or literally, because Rhaego's dead. 

There's another thing, too. Rhaego's is the only one without that Targaryen's death. In both the visions of Viserys and Rhaegar, it features the death of that Targaryen. That renders this one vision the odd one out, despite the fact that it's nigh universally regarded as Rhaego and his possible reign as the Stallion-Who-Mounts-The-World. All the evidence points to it, the copper skin, the silver-gold hair, the fiery stallion. But, what if it's not?

##Who Else Can It Be? 

In order to find out who the prophecy of the Tall Lord is, we have to analyze the evidence within the vision and why that points to Rhaego. Let's analyze the quote again. 

&gt;A tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair stood beneath the banner of a fiery stallion, a burning city behind him.

So there are four categories that lead us to define this as Rhaego, the height, the copper skin, silver-gold hair, and the banner of the fiery stallion. At the time of ACOK, there really isn't anyone else who it can be, but as the books came out, another possible suitor appears. His name is **Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name**, or, should you believe a certain theory, simply **Young Griff**. Now, how can this be Aegon?

**A tall lord**: Let's look at the first time we meet Young Griff, in ADWD, Tyrion II.

&gt;Tyrion craned his head to one side, and saw a boy standing on
the roof of a low wooden building, waving a wide-brimmed straw hat. He was a lithe and
well-made youth, with a **lanky build** and a shock of dark blue hair. The dwarf put his age
at fifteen, sixteen, or near enough to make no matter.

Young Griff is described as lanky, tall for his age, if a bit thin. He could easily fit the description of the ""tall lord"", should he grow into his height during his invasion of the Stormlands. 

**with copper skin**: This is a bit tricky. Young Griff's skin color is never described in depth and he's described as having the features of a Targaryen, with silver hair and violet eyes, and all that. However, should Aegon be who he says he is, House Martell is consistently described as having olive skin, with some of those with both Targaryen and Martell blood (such as Baelor Breakspear and Aegon's sister Rhaella) being described as inheriting the traits of House Martell. Should Griff inherit his alleged mother's skin color or gain a tan in the wars to come, his skin could turn to the copper color described. Copper skin *is* consistently brought to describe Drogo and the stillborn Rhaego, but this description could just be Daenerys seeing what she wants to see.

**and silver-gold hair**: Easy, Young Griff has the silver-gold hair of House Targaryen. Interestingly, this ""silver-gold hair"" so often described is missing its common pairing of purple eyes. This could be attributed to Martin simply finding it flowed better to not mention it or because Aegon doesn't have the traditional eyes of House Targaryen, with blue eyes in daylight and purple by candlelight, compared to Daenerys, whose purple eyes are often mentioned, or Rhaegar, who has ""deep purple"" eyes, or even Egg, whose eyes are near-black by lamplight and just purple in daylight.

**stood beneath the banner of a fiery stallion**: Now, this one is the easiest to link to Rhaego. He's the birth of a Dothraki stallion and the dragon, and so, a fiery stallion. However, there's one other character that is linked to the fiery stallion. 

&gt;So here's Bittersteel: a winged red stallion on a golden field. Only the horse has big black dragon wings instead of the usual Pegasus-style feathered angel wings, and he's snorting fire.

&gt;So Spake Martin, Dec. 26, 2005

Bittersteel. The founder of the Golden Company, which now rides for Aegon in his quest to retake the Iron Throne. I say that the figure is not under the banner *depicting* a fiery stallion, but rather one that represents the fiery stallion, Bittersteel. With all descriptors potentially met, it's definitely possible that Aegon is the one Dany sees, not Rhaego.

Now, if Aegon really is the person depicted in the visions, that leaves one question. What is the burning city?

##What This Could Mean

&gt;a burning city behind him.

Every other one of these visions in this set is the death of a Targaryen, their murder at the hands of another. From what we've seen in the television show, it's very likely that Daenerys and her forces will end up besieging King's Landing. However, it's unlikely Cersei will still hold the throne, due to the missing factor: Aegon. [As others have theorized](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/bozxfa/spoilers_main_99_of_the_shows_problems_are_due_to/), I believe that Aegon will end up in control of the south and be King on the Iron Throne (potentially the last king ever, should events play out similarly to the show). So, this leaves Aegon on the throne in King's Landing, as Dany breaks the wheel before him.

The burning city is King's Landing and this vision, like the others, is the death of a Targaryen.",asoiaf

377,"Okay, so I’m on this subreddit pretty often and it baffles me with how many posts and comments I see saying Jon is *the* main character of the series, it is his story to tell, and only his at that matter! 

While I do think some characters are particularly much more important than others, Jon Snow being one of them, him being the sole central part of the story goes against the many fundamentals that GRRM has stayed faithful to since the beginning of his career in writing fantasy. 

Let’s start listing the reasons. 

#**FANTASY TROPES**

Since day one, George has made it clear that he does not like the basic way of fantasy storytelling authors often use, writing off a hero to the story to save the day and leave it at that ultimately. This has been made clear since Ned Stark’s execution, the Red Wedding, oh so many events that come off the top of my head! 

Unfortunately the TV Series does come into play here. The majority of people have watched it. Considering how whitewashed the show has made him, it is not hard to believe why you may think he is destined to be the central character for this story. 

&gt; Jon Snow has always been the hero... he’s always been the savior. 

— [The show runners themselves ](https://youtu.be/ZJ1yC3yESLQ) 

Not only is it pretty terrible how the show runners of the show do not even understand the basic points of the series themselves, but it leads people to believe that this is George’s message — that this was his plan for his characters when it wasn’t. 

We don’t need to hear George say it over and over again, there are no pure heroes to his story. **Notice I said pure, because I believe there are heroes and there is heroism in the world but they do a fantastic job at overpraising him to be something he’s not.** GRRM believes everyone has even a little bit of *grey*, and in the books, every character ultimately lives up to this. Especially Jon. 

#**The meaning of A Song of Ice and Fire, Jon and Daenerys, and their importance to the story** 

This one is pretty self-explanatory I’d think. A lot of people are on the boat where they say to themselves: “*Oh my God!*, Jon is a Stark and a Targaryen! He is the song of Ice and Fire! It has been his story all along!” And partly, they are correct, but not for the latter statement. 

There are *many* layers to what A Song of Ice and Fire means. Let’s get into them. Firstly, we have to realize that this story is separated mainly into 3 structures: **The rise of Daenerys Targaryen in the East, the Game of Thrones and the fight between the Starks, Lannister’s, and other great houses in Westeros, and the rise of the icy threat beyond the wall** 

Of these components, two of them are outlying while one is pretty much central. The two that are outlying and represent the *Ice and Fire* of the series, which is **Daenerys and the icy threat beyond the wall**. This is [coming directly from GRRM himself at 4:55 of the interview ](https://youtu.be/GaPZGDlm2F4). 

So, there we have it, that is one of the very meanings. You may be asking yourself, where does Jon Snow fit into all of this? Is he categorized into the threat beyond the wall? Well, not necessarily although his storyline is heavily driven by it. Mainly no since he is a member of the Night’s Watch and looking to put an end to the threat; he is not necessarily the threat himself. But if you would like to categorize him into “Ice” because of this, you can certainly make an argument for it. 

At the time of the interview with GRRM that I linked, R+L= J was not revealed yet. This is important and probably why GRRM did not talk too much about all of the layers. Jon’s lineage does make his song one of Ice and Fire, for sure! In fact, this is even further supported if he is Azor Ahai reborn/ The Prince That Was Promised in the books as well — since Daenerys saw a vision where Rhaegar said his son with Elia Martell would have a song of Ice and Fire. Most presumably, Rhaegar got it wrong and this was likely an instance of foreshadowing for Jon Snow. 

Jon’s next couple of plot lines in the books are also going to represent this. He is going to have to unite Westeros in defeating the ice threat, the Others, and he’s also going to have to deal with Daenerys. This cannot possibly get any more “Ice and Fire” for him. Sure, but now let’s talk about the Fire in this story and why she’s important. 

Daenerys, throughout the entirety of the five books, has been in conflict with herself. We see her, this 15 year old girl, struggle with ruling and how it takes a mental toll on her. This is presented to us through her many visions, the voices she hears in her head, etc. She is not a Messiah or the hero coming to save the day like some people in Westeros believe, i.e. Aemon Targaryen, and at the end of ADWD she makes a major decision in choosing Fire and Blood. 

Uh oh, this doesn’t look so good for her! But we ultimately do see how the fire in this story is becoming a threat to humanity after all, she’s not just there and the reader is expected to think since AGoT that she is going to burn down all of the Seven Kingdoms. It’s a process. Simultaneously, when she gets to Westeros she has to deal with the Others, the convergence of Ice and Fire once and for all! 

...And Dany’s forces are all pretty much wiped out because of it (at least this is how I’m sure it will happen in the books). This makes the argument that Jon Snow ended both the Ice and Fire from the story invalid in some aspects. **The Others are being stopped because of Jon, yes, but also because of Daenerys who is putting everything on the line to help! And the others as well, Bran, Arya, etc., they will ALL have a major importance in defeating the Others.** There is a role for everyone and not one role is that much more significant than the others. Remember there is no Night King in the books as well, so not one person can be held accountably for killing him. 

Yes, Jon Snow *will* end Dany’s reign by killing her. He does put a definitive end to the threat of fire, even though you can argue Dany is much easier to handle since the Others took a toll on her forces. This makes him Azor Ahai/TPTWP (at least that is how I interpreted it), **but not the one that the story revolves around, as it is equally as important to see how Daenerys got to where she did, and her conflicts with herself and the Others,** how Tyrion got to where he did (I think he’s for sure taking a dark turn in the book), and etc. **Also, Jon’s decision to kill Dany will likely be influenced by the Starks, in saving them and the rest of the North, rather than simply “humanity” in Westeros.** 

At the end of the day, in terms of “Ice and Fire” I think you can definitely say **Dany and Jon are the biggest characters**, [again supported by GRRM](https://pizzabottle.com/44907-george-r-r-martin-said-jon-snow-daenerys-always-going-hook/). It is ultimately **their story to tell in THIS regard**. But in regards to everything happening in the middle? **The game of thrones?** **The very important house wars?** **No, there are still so many characters that embody this essential part of the story, and that is why there is no definitive main character.** 

#**THEMES** 

Yeah, this is another big one. I’m going to make it short since I don’t want to drag on for too long. But in terms of what the overall message(s) of this story are, I think Jon is a character who doesn’t embody them as much. I’d argue the themes pertaining to ambition, our dark human thoughts, the effects of war and age, apply more to characters like Tyrion, Dany, Arya, Jaime, Cersei, etc. I do think Jon being a bastard and sticking to his Stark roots at the end of the series despite finding out his actual parentage is **very** important however. 


**TLDR** - Jon Snow is not the main character of the series and neither is anyone else. “Ice and Fire” is a very layered meaning and it does not only apply to him. You can make the argument the biggest characters in terms of the “Ice and Fire” aspects of the series are Jon and Daenerys but there are other characters who better embody everything happening in the middle like Tyrion and Arya. Jon is a perfect example of doing heroic things but he’s not a savior, although the show completely missed the point in this regard, and I truly believe there are characters who carry out GRRM’s message more than he does.

Edit: I’m not denying there are not main characters to this story. I’m challenging the fact there is no one singular main character who has more importance than *everyone* else. Jon, Dany, Arya, Tyrion, and Bran are all perfect examples of this.",asoiaf

380,"Season 8 had a lot of wasted opportunities in terms of narrative, but most people agree that the actors did their best with the material they were given. Emilia Clarke arguably did the best she could considering her material was especially bad, but Clarke is famous outside of GoT for her vivacious, honestly hilarious personality that she hardly ever gets to showcase in any of her dramatic work, much less so her role as Daenerys. Daenerys is one of the only main characters to never get any particularly lighthearted moments to help deepen her personality. *A Song of Ice and Fire* is obviously far from a lighthearted series overall, but it has its fair share of humour and dark comedy. Dany doesn't really get any in the books either, though there is some at her expense in *ADWD*.

But they had a good opportunity to amend that -- to give Clarke a chance to show off some greater range beyond being serious and queenly. After the Battle of Winterfell in S8, the armies of the living collectively get rat-arsed in well-earned celebration of their victory. Most of the characters get some fun drunken moments, but it's mostly characters you'd expect. In the aftermath of a battle that quite literally decided the fate of the entire planet that was won in the living's favour, I expected the afterparty to be bigger than what we got, and I later realised that it could've been great if we'd seen unexpected characters loosen up and enjoy the moment.

Seeing Daenerys actually get drunk may have even provided some much needed justification for the forced Mad Queen subplot. Scenes of Dany being properly, openly happy and joking around for once would've been entertaining, especially since Clarke can do silly comedy well. Daenerys is usually a bit of a stonewall-type character, so I'd have liked her to perhaps get unexpectedly angry with Jon in the middle of the party for his popularity among the Northmen and maybe even display some uncharacteristic cruelty towards him rather than just unsubtle dirty looks. I'm not talking Joffrey levels of cruelty, but enough to provide a similar level of tension that could make Daenerys' descent feel just a tad more natural than it was. Furthermore, alcoholism is a prominent trait throughout much of the Targaryen line, and is of course partly what drove ya boi Viserys to his downfall. D&amp;D are quite obsessed with parallels and doubling so it's a shame they missed out on this.

While this may not be a relevant observation, it's just something I feel would've been nice to include, for Emilia's sake more than anyone else's. While I may mistrust David ""I have balls and you don't"" Benioff and Dan ""Who rides a fucking dragon"" Weiss to write actually funny comedic moments after some poor attempts in the rest of Season 8, they could've let the actors adlib a bit.

TL;DR: Daenerys should've got drunk at the Winterfell party. A true *wasted* opportunity.",asoiaf
381,"If the show’s season 8 did one thing right - albeit unintentionally - it is to show how vital the Young Griff plotline is to ASOIAF, both thematically and from a worldbuilding/character perspective. 

Prior to season 8, I was one of the readers who was very skeptical about GRRM’s decision to introduce fAegon so late into the books. I found it concerning especially given that there are supposed to be two more books to wrap up the story and yet this entire new plotline is brought in quite late in the game. I was wrong to doubt GRRM. 

One of the strengths of the books that the show completely fails in from season 6 onwards is George’s ability to make the world of ASOIAF feel lived-in. That is, Westeros and beyond all feel like they existed long before the book’s story, and will continue to exist long after the books conclude. The world abides by internally consistent rules, and actions have consequences following those rules. However, the show’s exclusion of the Young Griff plotline has made me realize why I felt so disappointed with the later seasons: the world feels so shallow and superficial. 

Let’s take a show example: Cersei blowing up the Sept. Now, this would have been an ideal cornerstone of the Young Griff plot (not that I think it will happen in the books but I can easily imagine it working within the larger Aegon plot). George establishes the importance of the Faith to the smallfolk and lords alike both in the main books and in Fire and Blood. Cersei blowing up the Sept should have started riots in King’s Landing. Those riots would have spread like wildfyre (tap tap is the mic on) across Westeros. We’d be getting reports of smallfolk actively attacking Lannisters in the Westerlands as a symbol of this corrupt regime. Rumours will swirl about Qyburn and his unholy atrocities. Even lords would reject the crown much in the same way some did under Maegor the Cruel. A dozen new “high sparrows” or Septon Moons would emerge to lead these fanatic (and armed) mobs, decrying the abomination that sits on the Iron Throne. In essence, the world would feel alive and responsive to character decisions. Actions have ripple effects well beyond the immediate result - something we saw when Cersei armed the Faith in the first place. 

Enter Young Griff. Blackfyre or not, the boy has been trained to be a king, including a rigorous education in the Faith. A savior has arrived. He unites the angry smallfolk and lords against Cersei and marches on King’s Landing. Much like Jahaerys I succeeding Maegor, Aegon may even make a deal with the Faith and receive their blessing thus legitimizing him in the eyes of the smallfolk and lords. Cersei is rooted out of the Red Keep and the cloth dragon is parades to the cheers of the crowd. 

Thus, when Daenerys arrives at Westeros, she does not face a universally despised alcoholic monarch hanging by a thread. She faces a beloved and popular King. Now she is the invader who is set to ruin the peace. The tyrant who wants to overthrow the rightful and legitimate heir. And here her madness emerges. 

Without Young Griff however, the show fell flat on its face. The need to have a human enemy for Dany in addition to the supernatural one meant that without Aegon, Cersei had to be kept in the game well beyond her expiry date. Along with a myriad of other baffling decisions, the result is the show’s world feels like a prop set, a stage for a set number of characters to recite their lines. There is no universe to get lost in, just a few one liners that can be printed on t-shirts and sold as merch. Thoughts?

TLDR: I’m sorry for ever doubting you about the inclusion of Young Griff, George. It’s an absolutely vital part of the plot and I was wrong to despair.",asoiaf

384,"Jojen: “I dreamed that the sea was lapping all around Winterfell. I saw black waves crashing against the gates and towers, and then the salt water came flowing over the walls and filled the castle. Drowned men were floating in the yard.”

Bran believes this refers to when Theon and the ironborn, representing the sea, take the castle and kill those Jojen sees dead in the yard. However, I believe this green dream hasn’t been fully realized yet.

Jojen describes the sea as lapping all around Winterfell, with waves *crashing against the gates and towers.* This describes the castle being stormed from all sides at once, with several gates being attacked. This is **not** an accurate telling of the Capture of Winterfell! Theon sends 4 men stealthily over the walls, who then fight their way to a gate and open it for the rest of the ironmen. Not exactly the salt water “flowing over the walls.”

I think in actuality this will refer to the when Winterfell is eventually stormed by the Others and their scores of the dead. In the dream, the “sea” and “black waves crashing against the gates” would refer to wights attacking the castle. This is a thematically consistent metaphor as “the sea” has been used in association with death/the dead before, most notably in Patchface’s prophetic ramblings. Of course, this would mean the Others/wights will succeed in taking Winterfell by direct force. Thoughts?

Edit: I almost forgot the most important part! Jojen also says ""**In the dark of night** the salt sea will flow over these walls."" Of course, the ironborn attack Winterfell at night, but I think it would make more sense for ""the dark of night"" in a magical prophetic dream to refer to the Long Night.",asoiaf

388,"In *Story*, Robert McKee presents what he calls the Principle of Antagonism:

&gt;A protagonist and the story can only be as intellectually fascinating and emotionally compelling as the forces of antagonism make them.

This isn't about the protagonist having a compelling antagonist, but rather about the depth of antagonism against the protagonist's central values. If a character seeks wealth, then the story is as compelling as the forces pushing him away from that and towards poverty. If they seek love and family, then it's the forces driving them towards isolation.

At the core of the principle is that antagonism isn't binary. McKee describes four states a value can be in, the Positive, Contradictory, Contrary, and Negation of the Negation. To simplify the terms though, I'll call these the Positive, Negative, Middle, and Hell. Think of the hell scenario as the monkey's paw perversion of the central value; it has the superficial markings of victory, but is a fate worse than death.

If a character seeks romantic love, the positive outcome is going to be a typical rom-com romantic ending. The middle ground might be not ""getting the girl,"" but strengthening important friendships. The negative ending is isolation from the object of affection. Hell is a loveless, unfaithful marriage. In a detective story, the positive is bringing the bad guy to justice, the negative is the bad guy escaping, hell is a bigger bad using a fall guy and ending up with even greater power, and the middle ground is the True Detective Season 1 ""the dark has more territory, but the light is winning"" outcome.

For a story to be fully engaging, we need to see each of these states in play -- they won't all necessarily come to pass during the story, but the audience needs to be able to understand what each of these outcomes would be like. When we look at the central values in A Song of Ice and Fire, we can then break out the four states of that value and see how as an audience we're cognizant of what those would be like -- and should we ever underestimate Hell, we're given it in full force. For ASOIAF, three core values are Justice, Life, and Family.

**Justice**

While ASOIAF is short on dispensing justice, we're never really left doubting what justice would look like. Let's take the question of Robert's succession. In the positive outcome, Ned would have taken Joffrey and Cersei into custody, protected them, installed Stannis on the throne (with a guarantee to at least protect Cersei's children, though perhaps not her for her treason against Robert), and Renly serving as Hand and softening Stannis's reign.

The middle ground is Joffrey is king and Cersei holding sway, but their worst impulses checked by Tyrion, Tywin, Kevan, and the other non-psychopaths at court. The wrong person sits on the throne, but the realm is in truth ruled by a competent council.

The negative outcome is one where Joffrey is not only on the throne, but where his commands are obeyed and go unchecked. It's a reign where he no longer needs to say ""I am the king.""

Hell is Stannis winning against Joffrey at King's Landing, defeating the Lannister forces, and then turning his army to destroy Robb, naming him traitor and usurper.

**Life**

Jon Snow's been beating this drum since Craster's Keep: the real war in ASOIAF is between the living and the dead. Melisandre has the same message, and (show) Syrio tells us there is only one god, the god of death to whom we say ""Not today.""

Positive: The maximum number of people not only live, but have (to borrow from Band of Brothers) long and happy lives in peace.

Middle: The Battle for the Dawn is won, and the realm returns to peace, but with significant losses. The realm survives, broken, but ready to be rebuilt as the new spring comes. Call it ""bittersweet.""

Negative: The Battle for the Dawn is lost, and the realm turns into a land of perpetual living death.

Hell: The Battle for the Dawn is won, but Daenerys turns mad queen and reigns through fire and blood. All the victories paid for with the deaths of good and brave soldiers reap only more death. The wheel is stronger than ever.

**Family**

The Stark family being split when Ned goes South, Jon Snow finding a new brotherhood, Cersei's love for Jaime and her children, and even Daenerys with her dragons, the series has always had family at its core. Looking at the Starks specifically though during the War of the Five Kings, we can see all the different possibilities:

Positive: The Lannisters accept Robb's peace terms (after some more bargaining, of course), Sansa is returned home and with peace restored, Arya makes it back as well. Catelyn gets to watch Bran riding Dancer, and when she learns about Jon's role in getting the saddle made she stops being so horrible to him the few times he's able to visit.

Middle: Robb and Catelyn die at the Twins, but Arya, Sansa, Bran, Rickon and Jon live on and are reunited, though only briefly before moving on.

Negative: They all either die or are scattered to the wind, never seeing each other again, never knowing what happened to anyone else, and not even knowing who is alive or dead.

Hell: Some of the surviving Starks are reunited, only to then betray each other. Or, quite possibly, Arya learns that the Brotherhood Without Banners is lead by Catelyn under the name Lady Stoneheart. She finally gets reunited with her mother only to then learn she's an empty, vengeful shell of the woman who'd raised her (and Arya is prevented from ending LSH). (Show) Sansa's return to Winterfell is a hell outcome.

**It Can't Always Be Hell**

While the hell option is certainly one of the things that makes ASOIAF stand out as being particularly brutal, all hell all the time gets really monotonous. Even Doom needs to spend time on Mars and Earth. It's enjoyable to have your emotional muscles stretched by being given events beyond what you thought possible (hey, the Bolton Northmen are retaking Winterfell!), but too much and it becomes one-note.

While no one is really expecting a happy ending to the series, it's not out of the realm of possibility that *one* of the central values the series is concerned with will find its way to a positive outcome. Perhaps justice wins out the day, but at a high cost in life and personal sacrifice. Similar to the end of Lord of the Rings (and I ain't talking about Aragorn's tax policies):

&gt;I tried to save the Shire, and it has been saved, but not for me. It must often be so, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them.

The value of peace in LotR hits the positive state, but the value of friendship lands at a *bittersweet* middle, and the sense of wonder and exploration and magic is actually at a negative as the Elves leave Middle Earth, the Ents have no sign of the Entwives, and the Fourth Age is one of peace, but not of magic.

**So What Happened With The Show?**

I believe one of the weaknesses in the final season was that too many of the outcomes were a forgone conclusion to the point where our minds don't dwell on the other possibilities. The Night King will be defeated, either in episode 3 or 4, though we don't know exactly how or how great (or insignificant) the losses will be -- we expect a positive or middle outcome. Dany will defeat Cersei but be killed by Jon afterwards -- we expect Jon and Dany will both go through hell.

The issue is not just that we've seen the ending, but that the show (largely because of pacing, I suspect) doesn't invite us to truly contemplate a full range of outcomes. By comparison, the novels are rich with possibility, even when we know what's going to happen. These possibilities are baked into the text and the character's thoughts. Will Joffrey reign, and if so, will he be checked by Tyrion as acting Hand? What if the war ends and Sansa is ransomed, but Arya remains missing? Will Daenerys decide that Slaver's Bay is her true home and kingdom?

In A Clash of Kings, when Stannis commands Davos to smuggle Melisandre into Storm's End, they discuss the nature of the future, and the fact that Melisandre has seen multiple conflicting ends:

&gt;Stand before the nightfire and you'll see for yourself. The flames shift and dance, never still. The shadows grow tall and short, and every man casts a dozen. Some are fainter than others, that's all. Well, men cast their shadows across the future as well. One shadow or many. Melisandre sees them all.

The novels are so keenly engaging because we're asked to think about the many different futures that may come about. The show ended with a more fatalistic view, to borrow from Dead Poets Society, it was less ""every many casts a dozen shadows"" and more ""'Twas always thus, and always thus will be.""

389,"I know there are several posts like this all over reddit, but I didn't see any still open for discussion and I need to talk to someone about this. Also, all of those posts were surprisingly positive toward Ned, many of the posts using some wording of the idea: ""His game was good, just not good enough."" This baffles me. I don't even mean to be a dick about it, but Ned's game seems just terrible to me, nowhere close to good.

He didn't start off as bad as possible, his time as Hand (when not looking into Jon Arryns murder) seemed tame until he sent people after The Mountain. But that was dumb and everything unraveled from there. He pretended he existed in some magical non-political world even though he knew Jamie had been allowed free after assaulting Ned and murdering Ned's men for political reasons, which should have been an obvious wake up call. He also was well aware that they murdered the last Hand and planned to murder the King but then continued poking the Lannisters in the eye over and over as if there'd be no consequences. But even all of that can be chalked up to a ""lack of political instincts"" as I've seen some people phrase it, and is not as bad compared to exactly how he handled the ""post-Robert's death"" coup.

He just didn't plan anything. He had barely any loyal men on hand, trusting Littlefinger of all people to get the loyalty of the City Watch. That's the obvious mistake, but it's just one in a long string. And it's not like we were still getting used to Littlefinger. We knew what he was, and Ned of all people knew. No sane person in this position would have called on Littlefinger when faced with this kind of situation. It just doesn't make sense. Why was Renly not his first call when he decided what he was doing?

What was his deal with Renly in general? Renly offered him help, he turned it down, changed his mind, never contacted Renly to tell him he changed his mind, and then was shocked to hear that Renly had skipped town. That's not even a lack of political sense, that's a lack of common sense or basic intelligence. If I ask you to do something, anything, and I say no, I should assume that you are working under the idea that I said No until I tell you otherwise, because that's literally what I told you. I seriously can't wrap my head around this one.

This hits on a larger point that applies to all his mistakes: You can be an honorable man, and still foresee the actions of your enemies that will be dishonorable. He's not just a naive honorable Lord, he's a dumb person to point out how dishonorable everyone is and then be shocked when they act dishonorably. Like he can choose to live as virtuously as he pleases, but he was more delusional than anyone if he bought into the things he told himself. His thoughts to himself like ""*What? The Queen hasn't run off?? What a fool?""* almost felt unrealistically naive. There's no way a grown man thought that she would leave. She held all the power.

And if he thought anyone would take his side, without him talking to any of them personally, just because they heard him prattling on about hair colors and true born Baratheons, then he doesn't understand how any of this works. He never even presented his evidence to anyone he could trust in the slightest. Like, idk, Robert! Or Ser Barristan, who certainly wouldn't have supported any coup or anything, but would have listened to the truth if he could prove it was the truth. Or, again, Renly!

My final point that I cannot get over is his timing. He goes out of his way to mention how his daughters safety is important to him. So he thinks *Ok, they'll be gone in 3 days, and I know that the Lannisters are actively planning Robert's demise, so what if I meet with the Queen and reveal my whole plan, giving her time to make me regret everything.* Why would he speak a word of this while his girls were still in KL? He specifically says he will wait, and then he meets with Cersei. I don't know what the consensus on this is, but I assume this meeting directly lead to Robert's ""death by boar"". I always assumed there was no way he died just naturally in a hunting accident. So Ned is the one who caused the events to happen before he was ready.

Looking back on this post now, it may seem like I'm just not accepting that he was naive and inexperienced with politics, but it feels like more than that. He had run Winterfell for what, 16 years. He had put down rebellions, he had dealt with the politics of his bannermen, etc. Some of the stuff he seemed inexperienced with, he should have been comfortable with by now. He should have known not to thin his guard out like he did, or to trust the Lannister owned city guard, or the snakes on the council. This was all stuff we know he knew.

I realize not everyone will agree with me, but before I get flooded with responses I do want to say that I get what the character is supposed to be. He's a naive northerner who actually cares about his people and decides things with honor in mind, not politics. I get that. But several times, Ned mentions a concern he has in his thoughts, and then just doesn't act on it, as if the problem will go away. He doesn't trust the Lannisters to play fair, he doesn't trust the council to be loyal, he knows he has to get his girls out of the city, he knows Robert is in trouble, etc etc. But all of the bad stuff he worries about happens anyway, because....? I'm not really sure. My answer is, I think, he's just not a smart human being. I'm having trouble seeing it any other way.

If anyone has any other explanation for any of this besides doubling down on his political naivety, I'd really like to hear it.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr:

Why did he come at the Lannisters while his girls were still in Kings Landing? Why didn't he talk to Renly at all after deciding to go for the coup? And why was Littlefinger more trusted than Renly? Also, why does Honorable = Stupid in this world?

To me, everything he did was not the actions of a naive honorable man who's unaccustomed to politics, but a reckless moron with no care for the safety of his family or his country.",asoiaf
390,"Do we have any ideas/theories at all regarding what ADoS will be about? I know it’s far away and the very last book of the series, but...I do know that TWOW is essentially going to be the most thrilling, highly anticipated, and important conclusion to the saga. It’s going to start with a ton of battles and have a lot of storylines and character arcs explained/wrapped up, *and* a lot of deaths, while other characters who haven’t been around for awhile will likely return/make an appearance and have a role to play. I assume it’ll be incredibly fast paced and a lot of things will probably be different from the show (or the same in some aspects, but written better/differently), with a hopefully satisfactory end. So, assuming both of the final books will be released, I’m looking forward to them. But, after TWOW ends, what more could GRRM have planned for his series? He’s very creative and always seems to have a lot to say/write about regarding the world he created, so maybe he’ll surprise us with even more discoveries to his world than we thought (like the west of Westeros, or unknown things about characters which somehow tie into the story.) I have the impression that a central part of ADoS will be about the Starks, considering the original title was called “A Time for Wolves”, but that’s about the only clue I have. I think it’ll most likely be an “aftermath of everything” sort of thing involving a time jump, but it’s hard to tell. Maybe there’s going to be more conflict/mystery and war, especially if TWOW ends on a cliffhanger.",asoiaf

It seems to me that's is all in her head! - and the emotional build was truly there; With her under Baelor's statue and Joffrey being a twat. What we get here in the book and not the show is how even down to the details like Cersei being Cersei, Littlefinger &amp; The Hound just standing by, but the fact that it's Varys running(in his soft slippers) to try and stop the whole ordeal.

Where are Jon and Eddard Baratheon?

394,"Remember how the show is named ‘Game of Thrones’ and not ‘A song of ice and fire’. 
 
The reason given to us was because HBO thought the title was too long and GOT sold better. But their statement became the best example of irony I’ve seen.

The name of the book series probably (almost cause of R+L=J) is referring to Jon Snow and how he’s central character of the universe and has a bigger role to play.

The show kinda forgot that (joke intended). Jon was reduced to being a side character to Daenerys in S7&amp;8. His only important scene was killing Daenerys which wasn’t even well explained (the change of his heart was too sudden and obviously bad writing). And the long night wasn’t the most important storyline, atleast according to the writers.

I believe GRRM is not going to let Jon out so easy. Jon has probably a lot of things to do in the books then we realise. And atleast the theory of Rhaegar’s son being the Prince that was Promised is probably true and Jon might be the one to stop the Others. 

The show didn’t care about his story and let itself play out the way the title suggests and that probably made D&amp;D think they’re too smart cause they can claim that our story was different that the books cause of the name. 

But it’s just my thinking. Let me know what you think.",asoiaf
395,"King Bran is foreshadowed in the books. I just finished his second chapter in my re-read, and there's already more than a few hints.

First and foremost: Bran has the first chapter in the series, besides the prologue. In that chapter, his father tells him that a man who hands down a death sentence should execute the sentence himself, so he can look the condemned in the eye and hear any last words they may have. Martin could easily have written this scene from Jon's, Robb's, or Ned's point of view. Martin had to have a reason for making this chapter the first one. Granted, the last half of the chapter was the first scene Martin came up with, before he knew anything about the overall story or the world. But Martin has never mentioned the execution scene when he talks about how he came up with the story. And it's easy for me to see Ned's philosophy coming into play in Bran's last viewpoint chapter, whether he judges Jon or not.

There are two lines in Bran's second chapter that become a lot more interesting when read with the endgame in mind. When Bran thinks about going south with his father, he
&gt;had been marking the days on his wall, eager to depart, to see a world he had only dreamed of and begin a life he could scarcely imagine.

Earlier in that same paragraph, Bran dreams of becoming a Kingsguard. He never once thinks about becoming king. So if he does go South in DoS, it will be the begin a life he ""scarcely imagined."" I may be reading to much into this particular line.

The second line is another matter. After climbing to the top of a tree, he looks down on Winterfell and
&gt;it made him feel like he was lord of the castle, in a way even Robb would never know.

Robb wasn't named king until well after he left Winterfell. But if Bran becomes king, he will rule Winterfell in a way Robb never did. I could see Bran actually ""ruling"" from Winterfell too. I don't see Bran becoming king the way he did in the show; I refuse to believe Martin will drop the magical elements of Bran's arc like the show did.

I'm excited to keep reading and see if there are any more hints scattered across the books. Knowing Martin's style and technique, I imagine there will be.",asoiaf
396,"While rewatching last season finale, this reflection came to my mind. 

Dany’s descent to madness arc is relatable to Gollum’s character arc in LOTR. They were good people who find themselves obsessed with an object (The Iron Throne=The Ring) and that obsession corrumpted them in their noble hearts. 

I know, last season was a mess. This particular part of her character arc was so badly developed that is almost non realistic. But I think this sounds like GRRM’s writing and is very likely to be in the books too. And it’s also known that GRRM took some aspects of LOTR’s characters to write ASOIAF (Frodo = Jon Snow, Ned Stark = Gandalf, etc) 

But I’ll feel more real and human. In the books, Dany wants to sail to Westeros because she thinks she has to, because is her right. It’s predestination. Not specifically an obsession.

But deep inside, she’s just looking for her place in the world. A place that feels like home. As she felt in her childhood, when she lived in the house with the red door. She has that fantasy that in Westeros she’ll find peace within herself. 

Maybe this will be her tragedy, not the obsession with power. It’s her obsession with something more abstract (and a little bit nobler) than a Throne: home. 
And her fall when she gets to Westeros to find out that things are not as she thought will be heartbreaking.",asoiaf

Personally, I'd mostly be really pleased to finally be getting the conclusion to ADwD and some new content, and support whatever makes it easier for him to finish the story as he wants it to be. I'd be hopeful that wrestling with the manuscript length and resisting the extension was ironically what's been taking so long, and now we might be back on track, especially if the new book succeeding in rejoining the various plot threads.",asoiaf
398,"&gt; From the 1993 outline:

&gt; Jaime Lannister will follow Joffrey on the throne of the Seven Kingdoms, by the simple expedient of killing everyone ahead of him in the line of succession and blaming his brother Tyrion for the murders.

How could Jaime Lannister possibly be in the line of succession?

&gt; From AGoT:

&gt; Robert sat down again. “Damn you, Ned Stark. You and Jon Arryn, I loved you both. What have you done to me? You were the one should have been king, you or Jon.”

&gt; “You had the better claim, Your Grace.”

What claim did Jon Arryn and Ned Stark have to the Iron Throne and what was Robert’s claim that was better than the two? Don’t talk about his Targaryen grandmother because she did not exist in AGoT.

&gt; From AGoT:

&gt; Many of the lords bannermen wanted to march on Harrenhal at once, to meet Lord Tywin and end Lannister power for all time. Young, hot-tempered Marq Piper urged a strike west at Casterly Rock instead. Still others counseled patience. Riverrun sat athwart the Lannister supply lines, Jason Mallister pointed out; let them bide their time, denying Lord Tywin fresh levies and provisions while they strengthened their defenses and rested their weary troops. Lord Blackwood would have none of it. They should finish the work they began in the Whispering Wood. March to Harrenhal and bring Roose Bolton’s army down as well. What Blackwood urged, Bracken opposed, as ever; Lord Jonos Bracken rose to insist they ought pledge their fealty to King Renly, and move south to join their might to his.

&gt; “Renly is not the king,” Robb said. It was the first time her son had spoken. Like his father, he knew how to listen.

&gt; “You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord,” Galbart Glover said. “He put your father to death.”

&gt; “That makes him evil,” Robb replied. “I do not know that it makes Renly king. Joffrey is still Robert’s eldest trueborn son, so the throne is rightfully his by all the laws of the realm. Were he to die, and I mean to see that he does, he has a younger brother. Tommen is next in line after Joffrey.”

&gt; “Tommen is no less a Lannister,” Ser Marq Piper snapped.

&gt; “As you say,” said Robb, troubled. “Yet if neither one is king, still, how could it be Lord Renly? He’s Robert’s younger brother. Bran can’t be Lord of Winterfell before me, and Renly can’t be king before Lord Stannis.”

&gt; Lady Mormont agreed. “Lord Stannis has the better claim.”

&gt; “Renly is _crowned_,” said Marq Piper. “Highgarden and Storm’s End support his claim, and the Dornishmen will not be laggardly. If Winterfell and Riverrun add their strength to his, he will have five of the seven great houses behind him. Six, if the Arryns bestir themselves! Six against the Rock! My lords, within the year, we will have all their heads on pikes, the queen and the boy king, Lord Tywin, the Imp, the Kingslayer, Ser Kevan, _all_ of them! That is what we shall win if we join with King Renly. What does Lord Stannis have against that, that we should cast it all aside?”

&gt; “The right,” said Robb stubbornly. Catelyn thought he sounded eerily like his father as he said it.

&gt; “So you mean us to declare for Stannis?” asked Edmure.

&gt; “I don’t know,” said Robb. “I prayed to know what to do, but the gods did not answer. The Lannisters killed my father for a traitor, and we know that was a lie, but if Joffrey is the lawful king and we fight against him, we _will_ be traitors.”

Well, that was interesting! Don’t forget that the letter of Stannis did not exist in AGoT. No one knew the twincest while this council took place. Apparently, “Robb’s Rebellion” was a thing and it was meant to be a copy of Robert’s Rebellion. It was a rebellion against an evil yet still seemingly lawful king.

Even if Robb’s argument was right and Joffrey ceased to be the lawful king for being a tyrant just like Aerys, what about Joffrey’s siblings? What about Viserys and Dany for that matter?

&gt; From AGoT:

&gt; “MY LORDS!” he shouted, his voice booming off the rafters. “Here is what I say to these two kings!” He spat. “Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine, from some flowery seat in Highgarden or Dorne? What do they know of the Wall or the wolfswood or the barrows of the First Men? Even their _gods_ are wrong. The Others take the Lannisters too, I’ve had a bellyful of them.” He reached back over his shoulder and drew his immense two-handed greatsword. “Why shouldn’t we rule ourselves again? It was the dragons we married, and the dragons are all dead!” He pointed at Robb with the blade. “_There_ sits the only king I mean to bow _my_ knee to, m’lords,” he thundered. “The King in the North!”

I don’t believe Greatjon was talking figuratively when he mentioned marrying dragons. Was there some sort of Targaryen-Stark marriage back in the day, which would also explain how Ned could have a claim to the Iron Throne as implied in the same book?

&gt; From ACoK:

&gt; Renly shrugged. “Tell me, what right did my brother Robert ever have to the Iron Throne?” He did not wait for an answer. “Oh, there was talk of the blood ties between Baratheon and Targaryen, of weddings a hundred years past, of second sons and elder daughters. No one but the maesters care about any of it. Robert won the throne with his warhammer.”

ACoK is the first time GRRM revealed marriage ties between Baratheons and Targaryens which proved the legal part of Robert’s claim. Note that this happens after the massive expansion of the saga. But still, the text reads like GRRM has not figured out the details of how Robert had Targaryen ancestry. That would have to wait for AFfC.

My speculation is that there was indeed past Targaryen marriages for Baratheons, Starks, Arryns and even Lannisters at the earliest conception of the story, which would all give them varying degrees of claims to the Targaryen seat. There is no other way to explain all the clues from the 1993 outline and AGoT.

And guess what? After the world expanded, GRRM still retained some of these marriages in various forms, although changing his mind about which characters should have Targaryen blood.

1. Baratheons were given a very recent Targaryen ancestry because GRRM felt that it was essential to explain Robert’s coronation.

1. Lannisters seem to have lost any possible Targaryen ancestry; unless GRRM has plans to provide them through Viserys Plumm’s daughter.

1. Arryns had three marriages with the Targaryens but none of them ended up providing Targaryen ancestry to Jon Arryn.

1. Starks were also explicitly forbidden by GRRM from Targaryen ancestry for some reason. Interestingly, GRRM played with the idea of the “Pact of Ice and Fire” and the rumor of a northern type marriage/bedding between a Targaryen prince and the bastard daughter of Lord Stark.

King Bran might have been among the earliest plans of GRRM while the Starks still had Targaryen ancestry and thus a claim to unified Westeros; but that ship has sailed long time ago.",asoiaf
399,"With how the show ends, it’s clear there isn’t much significance put into white walkers. They’re a plot device used to push northerners and wildlings into conflict and to promote an overarching sense of doom. It’s unnecessary. There’s enough history between the free folk and southerners that just the threat of a wildling army would’ve been enough to unite the north instead of needing to turn to extremes of the fantasy realm. The nights watch/Jon could’ve still plead to the 7 kingdoms for help and been ignored even though they are a huge threat because cerci would’ve wanted her enemies to be weaker prior to her launching a northern assault.

Now for the dragons. Though her army was pretty useless against the walkers, they would’ve made for an interesting fight vs the Lannister’s, grey joys, and golden company. Her brutal path to the throne could’ve been much more exciting if she wasn’t able to fix all her problems by saying dracarys. She still could’ve bought the unsullied (perhaps with long lost targ heirlooms) and her burning the Khals and gaining the Dothrakis support would’ve happened again with or without the dragons.

If he puts in the TWOW all the povs, it will have to be one or two chapter maybe per pov, and how can he solve everyone's issue in so little space?

And even further back the thrones belonged to whatever people were ruling the kingdoms. And you can go even further of course.

We also have Ned thinking about Lyanna and a promise : ""Promise me, Ned."" Could that be the same promise he made to Lyanna? Did Ned promise his sister that he would tell Jon who his mother is when he comes of age?",asoiaf

This is just something I was reminded of when I watched this Valkyrist video again (really good channel you should check it out). 

I really didn’t like the Manderlys in ADWD, it went against everything we’ve learned about them up till this point, they’re schemers and opportunity seekers just like the Frey’s, and that’s a good thing! In a better timeline they would help Roose and the Freys bring peace to the north and thus they can learn about the real threat. 

The second Robb becomes a king  Wyman try’s grabbing small council positions. Lady hornwood becomes single? He all over it (admittedly like everyone else, but his house is already the best off), and had to be ordered to work with the Umbers to build a fleet. 

Now suddenly they’re playing the “loyal stark men” angle, and it is clearly an angle, they wouldn’t insist on Davos handing them Rickon before pledging to Stannis if it wasn’t, the second he’s back from Skagos, Wyman will be showing him some eligible brides. 

The only reason he’s not committing to the Bolton’s and Frey’s, is because he’s getting no incentive. Ramsay has Winterfell, Hornwood, and maybe the dreadfort. Wyman will probably ending up housing a few Frey’s who have hardly a chance of getting the Twins, and he gets nothing. 

Wyman also shows a huge issue with stark supporters both in and out of universe, he’s a ruthless and vindictive guy, concerned only with his house’s standing, the only difference between Lord too fat, and the Late lord Frey is, one can laugh at the death of a child and cannibalize people and be called a hero, the other is never appreciated for the generosity he shows his family, or given the slightest sympathy when his family is harmed “oh no it’s not your fault Steveron died king Robb, even though you ignored his advice which would have probably prevented it” ""oh it’s fine king Robb, I’m sure you didn’t expect your iron born friend to take Winterfell and my grandsons hostage” “oh ya king Robb you should totally take your army back north to reclaim your lands, while we fight the Tyrells and Lannisters alone”",asoiaf

Heres an appreciation post for two small glimpses into the interactions between Joffrey and Renly.  I wish there were more.


Sansa did not understand. She looked at her prince. “Did I say something wrong, Your Grace? Why will he not speak to me?” 

“Ser Ilyn has not been feeling talkative these past fourteen years,” Lord Renly commented with a sly smile.  

Joffrey gave his uncle a look of pure loathing, then took Sansa’s hands in his own. “Aerys Targaryen had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.” “He speaks most eloquently with his -Sansa I AGOT

And also shortly after


‘When she got to the part where she threw Joffrey’s sword into the middle of the Trident, Renly Baratheon began to laugh. The king bristled. “Ser Barristan, escort my brother from the hall before he chokes.” 


Lord Renly stifled his laughter. “My brother is too kind. I can find the door myself.” He bowed to Joffrey. “Perchance later you’ll tell me how a nine-year-old girl the size of a wet rat managed to disarm you with a broom handle and throw your sword in the river.” As the door swung shut behind him, Ned heard him say, “Lion’s Tooth,” and guffaw once more.’ Eddard 3 AGOT

407,"Look I understand the Long Night according to in-universe writing is supposed to be incredibly bleak but my problem with the battle is that the way its paced it wants to start battle overwhelmingly bleak and hopeless and stays there for the entire duration of the battle which I feel harmed the episode in two ways:

1. In this case, it means the writers have to pull multiple contrivances out of their asses to get the main characters to this hopeless place. I mean consider the following advantages that should theoretically give the defenders a fighting chance against the Undead despite being outnumbered over 3 to 1 (according to game of thrones wiki estimates) like having the world's greatest light Calvery who are also among the world's greatest archers, having the world's greatest heavy infantry, having twice as many dragons as the enemy, being hold up in one of  Westeros's greatest castles, and being given time to prep defenses and create catapults. The showrunners, of course, went out of their way to make sure each every one of these advantages is either forgotten or used in the worse ways possible by characters who should know better.  

2. I also think it hurts the battle itself since by starting and maintain bleak and hopeless, it's hard to raise the stakes makes the battle feel overly samey despite some admirable attempts to add variety. Like, compare the Battle of Winterfell to Helms Deep where in the beginning there's hope as the defenders seem to hold their own (or at least inflict heavy casualties) against the numerically superior orc army so there's actually a big shock when the walls of helms deep are blown up and things fall apart. Hell, compare it to Battle of the Bastards where the battle starts out hopeless with near instant death via trampling but instead a chaotic but still survivable battle, which then, unfortunately, escalates into another damn near sure-death massacre when Jon and company are surrounded. Also it doesn't help that in one of it's very first scenes it has Jorah charge into a sure death situation and come back relatively unscathed telling the audience, ""don't worry your favorites will not die suddenly"" which really takes the bite out of the whole, bleak hopelessness vibe they're going for.

If you really wanted to raise the stakes and put them in a desperate situation the best way to do so I'd say is have the protagonists come up with a Blackwater-style crazy plan that initially seems to work but then backfires when the night king summons in his giant blizzard. Like for instance flanking the undead from both sides by the Knights of the Vale and the Dothraki while Dany cuts their army in two via a flame wall created by Drogon while the unsullied box them in from their remaining flank. The giant blinding fire smothering blizzard would cause said plan to backfire in an incredible way and probably put them in a situation where like in the original episode Greyworm needs to retreat but only I'd argue it would have much more weight behind it b/c again instead of going from losing to still losing, they went from maybe winning to losing.",asoiaf
408,"Starts with Jon. Its is a few years after bran is crowned king. Jon has become the king of the true north. He helps the wildling grow and build their tribes. Surprisingly, the seasons still happen and a very light snow falls across the north. 

The kingdom knows peace for a few years under bran’s rule. Then Tyrion dies, and kings landing starts to come undone. Bran is eventually betrayed and killed by someone. But not sure who. Maybe Greyjoy or Dorne since they didn’t have a say in the kings selection. The kingdom descends into chaos. The south is being run by the southern alliance of high garden, Dorne and the iron islands.  Bronn is essentially the general and basically ruler. Storms end is under siege by the Dornish. 

Jon stays out of it but still wants revenge for bran. Sansa and the north rally the banners and head south. Brienne goes to sansa’s side. But the north is defeated, possibly with a surprise betrayal from Edmure tully. Something along the lines of, you’ll never tell me to sit again little niece. Sansa is captured. 

Jon can’t take it. He gathers the wildlings. Including ghost, who never leaves his side. They head south. The remains of the northern army join jon. Saying he is the true king of the north, and saved them from the mad queen that they witnessed burn king landing. This statement hurts Jon. (Can’t change that now, just gotta go with it) He continues south and has several small victories. 

Sansa is being held at kings landing. Kings landing was rebuilt and created much stronger under Tyrion’s guidance while he was hand of the king under bran. Jon, not wanting to destroy and pillage Westeros, heads straight to kings landing to end the war. Jon attacks, but unlike before, Bronn keeps his armies inside the walls. Jon batters his troops against the walls. He is injured and ghost takes a crossbow bolt. The assault fails and they retreat with Jon’s injury. He must take the city, because Edmure Tully is coming to flank him with a hammer and anvil tactic against the wall. 

Jon prepares for a second attack with a depleted army. But as he does, Edmure arrives with his host earlier than expected. Bronn stands on the wall and laughs at Jon. As Edmure’s calvary descends, Jon stands battle of the bastards style ready to die. As the tully horse prepare a lance charge to decimate the north and wildlings, fire erupts through the lines! Drogon has returned! He lands in front of Jon and roars. Bronn shits his pants.

Jon climbs on the back of Drogon, who is even bigger than before. They begin to destroy the Tully army. Edmure is thrown from his horse. Ash and smoke is everywhere. He’s on the ground watching his army be destroyed when he hears something. He slowly turns and sees two burning red eyes come out of the smoke. Ghost rips into him. 

Jon hits the main gate with fire and it begins to burn. Unlike season 8, dragons breath isn’t explosive and the north needs to wait for the gate to burn down. The north flood the city. Tormund searches for Brienne. He finds her and releases her. But they are attacked by Greyjoy’s. Yara attacks Brienne while tormund battles yara’s guards. Brienne slays yara, after tormund takes a blow from yara that would’ve went through Brienne’s guard. Tormund and Brienne kiss. 

Jon finds Bronn looking down at brans wheelchair. He says the cripple could see soo much, but couldnt see me pushing him down the tower stairs. They fight and are pretty equal. As they fight, Bronn starts to be surrounded by Jon’s allies. Drogon, ghost, tormund Brienne watch and Bronn knows he’s doomed. He says something like, “At least I’ll end the Stark and Targaryen lines before I die” and lands a dagger thrust to Jon’s shoulder. It knocks Jon down to a knee. Bronn swings a powerful overhead strike and Jon barely gets his sword up to block. They hit and sparks fly. The sparks hit longclaws blade and it ignites. Flaming super bright, Bronn steps back. Jon rises, and is on the offensive. He has Bronn retreating with a flurry of flaming blows. He sticks longclaw through bronns chest. And the flames engulf bronn’s body. Jon exhausted, collapses backward. Ghost howls and Drogon roars and the screen goes dark. 

The next scene shows the walls of the red keep with banners hanging. They are of a black dragon on a red field and the other side a white dire wolf on a black field. Jon sits with a crown on his head, listening to nobels squabble. Brienne is holding a extra large baby with bright red hair. Ghost is by his side. Jon looks annoyed and bored.  Suddenly he catches a shadow block out the windows light. He goes over to the window. He peers out and sees Drogon soaring through the clouds. As he looks, he swears he sees a woman on his back. Dany? He says quietly. He smiles and rubs ghosts head. Roll credits

As she descends deeper into the ice cave, we see a bear and giant spider watch her pass. It looks as if they bow slightly? She lays the bundle on a ice slab and looks up.

415,"So okay now that game of thrones is over and the dust has settled a bit. I have the question, considering the final season was such a massive diss appointment with man stories and arch’s foreshadowed and set up in previous seasons only to be let down. 

The main that comes to mind for me is Jon’s arch, so much hype about his resurrection, his parentage and his potentially to be Azor ahai, yet he ends up back where he started, 

Bran being setup to be a timetravelling all knowing tree god; he spends the final season starring at people blankly then random becomes king. 

Jaime who looked to have redeemed himself yet to only make a dramatic u turn and be killed by some bricks. 

No explanation about the others, rhllor, mels powers, prince who was promised.  

These are only a few of the ones I was unsatisfied with (I didn’t mention Danny because that could be another paragraph in itself) 

So in winds of winter il assume there will be many differences in the show, considering they split from storylines so long ago the ripple has be significant. And idea I have for one difference would be :

Instead of the night king killing one of Danny’s dragons, he will use the horn of winter to destroy the wall and there might be an ice dragon inside it... well this is only an idea.

Basically my question.

419,"There once was a Frenchman named Camus. He wrote a lot. One of the things he wrote was an essay titled [""The Myth of Sisyphus.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus) This essay is taken as the central Camus text on the absurd. If you are too lazy to Ctrl+T and search wikipedia for ""absurdism,"" here's what the free online encyclopedia has to say for you:

&gt;...man's futile search for meaning, unity, and clarity in the face of an unintelligible world devoid of God and eternal truths or values.

Hey, an unintelligible world devoid of God and eternal truths or values? You know what that sounds like? Westeros! (Planetos/GRRTH are also acceptable answers). 

The most famous line from Camus' essay is [the final one](http://dbanach.com/sisyphus.htm): 

&gt;The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.

(Of course, the myth of Sisyphus is the myth of the man in Hades doomed to forever roll a boulder up a mountain, only to have the boulder come crashing back to the bottom again. Sisyphus is forever rolling a boulder up a mountain, for no purpose other than the roll of the boulder. You might say that the climb is all there is). 

At the end of *Game of Thrones*, two characters in particular are faced with Sisyphean tasks: Tyrion and Bran. Especially Tyrion. For Tyrion, his Handship is no longer a position of privilege. He's not being made Hand as an extension of his father's will, part of a corrupt noble bloodline rotting away beneath the throne. Rather, he is being made Hand because it is how he will serve people. Because he deserves it - not in the ""I was born for this/I am a Lannister/I am the blood of the dragon"" sense, but because it is something that he needs to do to build a better world for other people. Will he succeed? It hardly matters. As he says to Jon: ""ask me again in ten years."" The seven kingdoms (six kingdoms?) are his boulder, and he had best set his shoulder to the task and get pushing. One must imagine Tyrion happy; the struggle itself is enough to fill a man's heart. 

Bran, too, is here to serve, and the future is no plainly-written thing for him. Despite the many, many posts to the contrary, Bran is not omniscient, nor does he know what's going to happen next. He has extra help, certainly, but he's not on easy street. Tyrion crowns Bran, though, for a reason: the creation of meaning against an absurd world. To quote Camus, Tyrion ""makes of fate a human matter, which must be settled among men."" There is no one bloodline that is fated to rule over all others; controlling a magical creature like a dragon doesn't confer some utter divinity over all other humans. Tyrion chooses Bran's story, and that is because it is a human story, ultimately, not a story about a dragon-woman or the prince who was promised. A story about being broken! 

At the very end of the show, for just a moment, Jon Snow turns back and looks toward the Wall. He looks south and reflects on his life. The meaning that he thought existed is no longer there. He isn't a Stark of Winterfell or a Targaryen of Dragonstone. He's himself. In the words of Camus: ""His fate belongs to him. His rock is a thing."" In fact, to quote more extensively, you could almost imagine this as a description of Jon's last scene:

&gt;At that subtle moment when man glances backward over his life, Sisyphus returning toward his rock, in that slight pivoting he contemplates that series of unrelated actions which become his fate, created by him, combined under his memory's eye and soon sealed by his death. Thus, convinced of the wholly human origin of all that is human, a blind man eager to see who knows that the night has no end, he is still on the go. The rock is still rolling.

Now, I don't think *Game of Thrones* or ASOIAF are absurd texts entirely. There's too much Romance in the story for that. But the fates of our protagonists, beating on like boats against the current, speak to the acceptance that there is no mighty Fate or Destiny or R'hllor controlling us and giving secret meaning to our lives. Rather, all that matters is, to quote Gandalf, ""what to do with the time that is given us."" There are strange forces out there, sure - Bran is a wizard, literally. But in fact, that in and of itself is what makes the world absurd! The inability for us to explain things in a purely rational way - that's the absurd at work. The great contradiction between the search for meaning and and the unreasonable world. Camus argued that recognition of that contradiction - not acceptance, but recognition - was the only path forward for the absurd man. I think Camus might have agreed with Jojen Reed when Jojen said ""if ice can burn, then love and hate can mate."" The existence of two contradictory things together, forever. A song of ice and fire. 

Isaac Hempstead-Wright, who played King Bran the Broken himself, [penned an essay](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-series-finale-bran-stark-as-king-explained-isaac-hempstead-wright-guest-column-1212195) about the end of *Game of Thrones*. It's quite a good read, and a good reflection on his career as a young kid growing into a man through *Game of Thrones*. But there's one line that stood out in particular:

&gt;Life doesn’t have neat, happy endings; it is ambiguous and ultimately inconsequential.

Ambiguous and ultimately inconsequential. And yet, one must imagine Westeros happy.",asoiaf
420,"There is a lot of speculation out there about what Jon will be like when he returns to life in TWOW. It seems that the general consensus is that the experience of dying, and being resurrected, will significantly change his personality, and he won't be the Jon that we all know and love. The basis for this argument is that Lady Stoneheart is significantly different from Catelyn, and Beric Dondarion made it clear that he was not the same man he was prior to resurrections by Thoros. 


However, Jon's circumstances may not be the same as those of LSH and BD.  LSH was dead for weeks prior to her resurrection, and BD clearly states that he loses a part of who he was with each subsequent resurrection. Therefore if Jon is resurrected relatively quickly, and only once, he may well be similar to the Jon we see at the end of DWD. 

It seems that the key question becomes, how long will Jon be dead before Melisandre brings him back to life? The resurrection can't happen immediately (as it did with BD in most cases) because he has to be dead long enough for everyone to know he is dead. This will be the technicality that will allow him to  be released from his oath to the NW, and free to venture south without being considered to be a deserter.  However, it seems likely that he won't be dead for a long time either. Maybe only a few hours. The reason this seems likely is that his corpse will be surrounded by multiple people who are inclined to burn dead bodies due to the danger of them becoming wights. In addition, he has no home to return his bones to (WF is in the hands of the Boltons, and Jon is a bastard). He has no family who remain to bury him. Why would they preserve his dead body for an extended period of time? 


It doesn't seem logical that he would be dead for days prior to being resurrected. Therefore, it may be that he is very similar to the JS who died at the end of DWD.",asoiaf

422,"This is something I've been mulling over for a bit, and after reading a couple of posts today, thought it would be appropriate.

This is primarily centered on Dany's endgame in the show and why I think it will be the same in the books, but also is more broadly about how Martin likes to have parallel characters/events in different story arcs.

**So, to start with two less controversial examples:**

In ACOK, Jon/Theon has a mentor figure, Halfhand/Cleftjaw, known for a disfiguring injury and celebrated as a badass because they didn't let that injury phase them in battle, and instead gruesomely and awesomely killed their opponent.

Also between AGOT and ACOK, various characters have sort of shady friends/allies.  Arya has Jaqen, Sansa has Sandor, Tyrion had Bronn, Bran has Osha, Davos has Saan, and Theon has ""Reek"".  In fact, you could also look at say Bronn, Davos, and Janos as similar but contrasting takes on the ennobled up-jumped commoner"".

Obviously, there are some pretty big differences between these examples and some are more of a stretch than others, but I think/hope this gets at how Martin likes to use parallels.

**Now for the more controversial part:**

So, in AFFC and ADWD, you have a female POV character Cersei/Dany/Arianne/Asha who wants respect and is haunted by the shadow of their brother Tyrion/Viserys/Quentyn/Theon.  They are attracted to a ""bad boy"" Aurane Waters/Daario/Darkstar/Qarl, generally a sign of bad judgment, and ignore a ""nice guy"" Jaime (okay, this one is kind of a stretch)/Quentyn/Oakheart or Dalt or Daemon Sand (Arianne is busy)/Trisstofer, also generally as a sign of bad judgment.

And with Dany and Cersei specifically, both of their arcs also have them ordering the torture of essentially innocent people.

Now again, there are some important differences between arcs.  Like for example, Qarl is actually a good guy/ presented as a good choice and similarly, Asha doesn't really have that aspect of ""not as smart as she thinks she is"" that is a large element of Cersei, Arianne, and Dany's characterization, but I think what these parallels highlight is that while these other characters are definitely contrasted with Cersei and have much better motivations, they aren't necessarily being presented as examples of good female rulers as a contrast to her as an example of a bad female ruler (if you are looking for that, you should probably be looking to Sansa and  possibly Asha).

To the contrary, Martin seems to show their actions having a lot of similarities (and dare I say uses the same sexist stereotypes) even if their actions differ.

**What does this mean?:**

So, with that background in mind, Jon Con in the book is definitely going to commit an atrocity spurred on by the sound of bells.  But that doesn't rule out Dany also committing an atrocity (bells optional).  It's kind of like how Martin takes pain to show Hoster Tully committing war crimes and abusively poling a child's sexuality in ways that are similar (if less insanely evil) than those of Tywin.  Again, good/different intentions is not a predictor of good/different actions.

And yes, Cersei in the books is definitely going to be killed by Jaime, probably in reaction to her doing something really evil and/or to stop her from doing something really evil.  But that doesn't rule out Jon also killing Dany in reaction to her doing something really evil and/or to stop her from doing something really evil.  Is it sexist, probably.  Does it line up with parallels between the characters, also probably.

Lastly, tangentially related to the above, this is also why for example, I wouldn't necessarily think that Gendry being legitimized in the show is just him taking over Edric's book plotline (no reason both couldn't be legitimized in the books), even though the inherited Edric's role as a potential human sacrifice.  Or similarly, I wouldn't assume that Bronn in the show was just taking over Brown Ben Plumm's book plotline, especially because the book itself (and Tyrion himself) frames Ben as a replacement Bronn.

Thoughts?

**Addendum:**

I realize that I didn't get into another big one- the assumptions that Jon is absorbing all or part of Young Griff's storyline.  Honestly, I really am not sure myself about that one (among other things, I think there is good basis for Jon's ""real name"" being Aegon, Aemon, or even Jahaerys).  But also, I feel like this one is at least halfway an R + L = J discussion, which has been well-argued in any number of other threads.",asoiaf
423,"In AGOT Chapter Catelyn VII, Cat discusses the attempt to foster Robin Arryn with Maester Coleman.

Earlier in the book they find out the idea of fostering him at Casterly Rock from both King Robert and Lysa, correct? As King Robert suggests it to strengthen the boy and Lysa uses it as a concern of letting Robin go. I'm sort of confused by the significance of this, as did Jon change his mind after he discovered the ""seed is strong"" truth? Were the Lannisters then suspicious when he attempted to foster his son at Dragonstone instead of Casterly Rock slighting them in the process?

I understand Jon was not a friend of the Lannisters and skeptical of them and their power over the King but I'm confused why we didn't know about the Dragonstone idea until this chapter from Maester Coleman and not from Lysa or King Robert.",asoiaf

And why is he haunted, isn't Jon safe at the wall by now with his permission? If there was something else he had to do didn't he have the time in 14 years? Idk... the rest of the story with Rhaegar giving her the flowers and needing one more child kind of fits I guess, but the thing doesn't seem certain to me. I really thought the 5 books would clarify the mystery but they don't.",asoiaf
426,"To be honest, I was fully on the anti-D&amp;D bandwagon after the botched seasons 6, 7 &amp; 8. Recently I started reading the books, hoping to get from them what I failed to get from the show, if and whenever TWOW and ADOS are released (Gods...we waited forever for TWOW. Imagine it'll be another 15 years before we ever get ADOS!). But reading AGOT and rewatching Season 1 I have noticed a lot of deviation from the books and NOT in a bad way. So much of D&amp;D's original creations were not just good or acceptable but actually great if not genius. Two of my favourite scenes were not even in the books. The first being the tit for tat between Varys and Littlefinger in front of the Iron Throne. I LOVE the Varys and LF rivalry. But their conversation and animosity is lacking in the first book. Scene 2 is one of my all time favourites of any show. When Tywin skins and dresses the stag before Jaime while giving him a speech on family and their legacy. The introduction of Tywin is that scene is just so well &amp;;/ a shred of that love or admiration from anybody in his life despite being forced to shoulder an entire dynasties legacy from as young as he can remember. There is so much not in the books. These were all great additions either thought up by D&amp;D or at least approved by them in the least. So what went wrong? Clearly we know they are talented or had to have been in order to give us years worth of the show we all grew to love. Did they jusy say fuck it and stop caring once they knew they were making a SW trilogy? What happened between when it was good and when the slump started? Thoughts?",asoiaf

429,"When the show ended I, like many others, was extremely disappointed and let down by the ending. For some reason, however, the more I thought about it, the more I enjoyed the idea of Bran becoming King. He has always been one of my favourite characters, and the story started with him. It only seems fitting that it end with him too. That and his TER abilities would be put to good use as king, this is assuming the Others are defeated of course. Also depends on if Stannis survives past the battle for Winterfell",asoiaf

432,"Call me what you will. I know what Isaac supposedly said D&amp;D supposedly said GRRM supposedly said etc. I just don’t buy that Bran might end up as the king of a (nearly) unified Westeros in the books. In order to be the king of a unified Westeros, one has to derive a claim from Aegon the Conqueror or personally make his own unification. These are the rules in the books. Bran does not have a claim that derives from Aegon the Conqueror. Bran does not have the power to conquer Westeros as Aegon did; nor can he achieve his unification with his “wonderful story”. No Lord of Westeros is that stupid in the books. The only king I can see Bran being is the King in the North (albeit for a short time), which is a theory I enlisted to since very early times I read the books.

&gt; Beneath the great grey cliffs a horse was dying noisily, struggling to rise on a broken leg and screaming when he fell. His brother circled round him, then tore out his throat while the horse kicked feebly and rolled his eyes. When he approached the carcass his brother snapped at him and laid back his ears, and he cuffed him with a forepaw and bit his leg. They fought amidst the grass and dirt and falling ashes beside the dead horse, until his brother rolled on his back in submission, tail tucked low. One more bite at his upturned throat; then he fed, and let his brother feed, and licked the blood off his black fur.

&gt; …

&gt; [_Winterfell_] was not dead, just broken. _Like me_, [_Bran_] thought. _I’m not dead either_.

Here we see that after the Sack of Winterfell, Summer and Shaggydog killed a horse and fought over the prey. Summer overpowered Shaggydog and fed on the horse first. Then he let his brother feed while licking his wounds. 

The horse with the broken leg symbolizes the broken Winterfell. The symbolism suggests a conflict between Bran and Rickon, from which Bran will emerge on top. The clues setting up this “Starkbowl” are already provided in the books.

&gt; “Roose Bolton has Lord Eddard’s daughter. To thwart him White Harbor must have Ned’s son … and the direwolf. The wolf will prove the boy is who we say he is, should the Dreadfort attempt to deny him. That is my price, Lord Davos. Smuggle me back my liege lord, and I will take Stannis Baratheon as my king.”

At first glance, you might miss the careful wording here. Lord Wyman was not specific about the particular son of Ned he requested; despite Davos and the readers are led to believe that bringing Rickon back should be enough to satisfy this demand. But as long as Bran lives, he is the liege lord, not Rickon. Unless Davos can retrieve Bran or prove his death, Lord Wyman can always back away from his promise to Stannis even if they give him Rickon. This is not something overlooked or unintended on the part of the writer. GRRM draws our attention to another “deception by wording” in regards to Stannis within the same book and implies that these things were carefully constructed.

&gt; “You have my word, Lord Snow. I will return, with Tormund or without him.” Val glanced at the sky. The moon was but half-full. “Look for me on the first day of the full moon.”

&gt; “I will.” _Do not fail me_, he thought, _or Stannis will have my head_. “Do I have your word that you will keep our princess closely?” the king had said, and Jon had promised that he would. _Val is no princess, though. I told him that half a hundred times._ It was a feeble sort of evasion, a sad rag wrapped around his wounded word. His father would never have approved. _I am the sword that guards the realm of men, Jon reminded himself, and in the end, that must be worth more than one man’s honor._

Jon promised to keep the princess closely but since Val is no true princess, Jon would argue that he should not be held accountable in case Val did not return. It never came to that but if it did, this was the best excuse Jon could think of.

Returning to the Starkbowl, I can see Davos bringing Rickon back (though I am less sure about Shaggydog). Some might even consider Rickon the Lord of Winterfell. But the foreshadowing and the direction of the plot require Bran’s return. What better way to reintroduce Bran to the northern story than playing the loophole in the promise of Lord Wyman?

In the post-Bolton Winterfell, Bran’s whereabouts will surely be discussed before Rickon can be acclaimed as the Lord of Winterfell. For a start, they will know that both Rickon and Bran survived the sack. They will know that the boys went separate ways for safety reasons. The Liddle whom Bran met on the way will tell them that he saw Bran destined to the Wall through mountain paths. But there won’t be any news of Bran’s arrival to the Wall or any sign of him somewhere in the North. That is where their knowledge will end; that is until Sam reveals the truth.

I am more and more convinced that Sam will return to the North in the short term and might even be at Winterfell or the Wall while these discussions are taking place. He will reveal how he let Bran pass beyond the Wall. Therefore, the northern lords gathered at Winterfell will require finding out Bran’s whereabouts beyond the Wall or at least confirming his death before taking Rickon as their liege. 

After that, the story basically writes itself. There will be a ranging beyond the Wall. They will somehow find the cave but for various reasons the magic ward will be broken and the cave will be stormed by the Others. They will have to return through Gorne’s Way (this is where I expect Hodor moment to happen). They will lose a lot of time in the darkness of the caves beneath the ground. During their long absence, they will all be presumed dead and Rickon will be declared the Lord of Winterfell. There might even be a new Lord Commander chosen as I believe Jon will participate in this ranging. But when they emerge from the darkness and return to Winterfell, Bran will reclaim the title from Rickon and eventually be crowned as the King in the North, depending on the fortunes of Stannis in the wars to come.
	
I think this is the only crown Bran will have in the books. For a brief period, he will be Bran the Winter King (compare him to King Edwyn Stark, better known as Edwyn the Spring King). At some point in the story, Bran will leave his seat to his heir Rickon, just like Summer let Shaggydog feed on the horse after he had his way.

&gt; “Those you call the children of the forest have eyes as golden as the sun, but once in a great while one is born amongst them with eyes as red as blood, or green as the moss on a tree in the heart of the forest. By these signs do the gods mark those they have chosen to receive the gift. __The chosen ones are not robust, and their quick years upon the earth are few, for every song must have its balance__.”

A greenseer king can’t have a long reign or a happy ending. Bran should be the Frodo of ASOIAF and retire to a secluded place like the Isle of Faces at the end of the story. Or by GRRM’s own words, we have to admit that the Song of Ice and Fire has no balance.",asoiaf
433," 

I saw a discussion yesterday I believe about why Sansa doesn't deserve the hate she gets, and why her actions are reasonable, smart even. I am not going to address the first bit, whether anyone loves or hates a certain character is naught to me and I don't mean to argue against it.

However, I am going to try and show that Sansa in season 8 is actually, in some regards, less intelligent\\political savvy than her season 5 counterpart, presumably before she has learned all her lessons yet.

The problem with season 8 Sansa actually appears in the very first sentence she utters this season. ""Winterfell is yours, your grace.""  
The delivery of the line has been intentionally cold, and Daenerys is immediately taken aback. Sansa has just met Daenerys and the first thing she does it establishing a rivalry between them. Sansa knows Daenerys is technically now their queen, but she doesn't know her in person, it stands to reason that she knows nothing about her actually, considering how even Jon didn't hear about Tarly's execution yet.

What's more, Sansa is clearly not the one with the power, it is Daenerys with her dragons and armies, in Winterfell. Insulting such a person, that you nothing about, is not particularly smart., if Daenerys somehow proved to have Joffery's streaks, it could even come to bloodshed. On top of that, Daenerys supposedly holds Sansa's prize card - northern independence.

Logically, when dealing such a person for the first time, it is wise to make them your friend. Not only making Daenerys an enemy is dangerous, it also diminishes the chances of her giving Sansa what she wants.

&gt;Always keep your foes confused, if they don't know who you are, or what you want, they don't know what you plan to do next.

If Sansa truly learned anything from Littlefinger, how come she didn't try and make Daenerys a friend first? Littlefinger was everyone's friend, that's why people trusted him and why he was able to manipulate so many people.

When Sansa is given a chance to fix her mistake, when Daenerys comes to her in order to rebuild their relationship, not only she does very little to cooperate, she also outright tells Daenerys she wants northern independence, and she didn't even bother to make Daenerys sympathetic to her desire, all she said was: ""It was taken from us. We took it back and said we will never bow to anyone ever again, what about the north?"" Was Sansa truly expecting Daenerys will simply give up more than 50% of Westeros, after the King in the North bent the knee to her? Not particularly clever.

Now, do we have a scene where Sansa meets another person she doesn't trust, and that she has no power over? Well, we do. Roose Bolton, no less. The man, the legend. The northern who was a major player in the Red Wedding, where her mother died, the northern armies have been slaughtered and where he stabbed her brother in the heart, before taking Winterfell to himself.

After the initial shock, Sansa greets Roose Bolton in a warmer courtesy than how she greeted Daenerys. Interesting...",asoiaf

435,"**I was rewatching season 5 recently, and I noticed a certain familiar pattern. It goes like this:**


• Daenerys captures a member of the Sons of Harpy

• She chooses not to execute him, and keep him as a prisoner for a time

• One of her supporters, a freed slave, disagrees, and suggests executing the prisoner, his judgement clouded by the wrongs the Sons of Harpy did to him, and his family

• Daenerys doesn’t agree with him, and still decides to spare the prisoner, untill there’s a fair trial 

• Despite this, the freed slave goes against his Queen’s orders, and kills the prisoner anyway

• Dany decides to execute the freed slave, her supporter, for this crime

• Because of this, the other freed slaves start turning against her


**Now let’s remind ourselves of the Karstark situation:**


• Robb captures two Lannister hostages

• He chooses not to execute them, and keep them prisoners for a time

• Lord Karstark disagrees, and suggests executing the prisoners, his judgement clouded by the wrongs Lannisters did to him, and his family

• Robb doesn’t agree with him, and still decides to spare them

• Lord Karstark decides to kill them anyway, going against his King’s orders.

• Robb executes Lord Karstark, one of his bannerman.

• Because of this, a huge portion of his army turns against him


And since the Dany plot is original to the show, I’m just left asking... why use the almost exact same thing twice? The only differences between these two plot points was that the Son of the Harpy was undeniably more guilty that the two Lannister boys (but that wasn’t important in any way,) and of course Robb suffering proper consequences for his actions. 

(This is not a “D&amp;D bad” sort of post, to be honest I kinda gave up on the show long ago, when I noticed them continuously skipping important character moments (like Tysha confession for example) and then wondering why are they suddenly dealing with a bunch of underdeveloped characters with no idea how to get them where they want them to be.)

I just noticed this little thing, and it got me wondering... I guess when you run out of source material, what is there to do other than just use it again.",asoiaf

"" There’s a lot that I love about Sansa. She’s one of the few child POVs that convincingly passes for an actual child, unlike, say, Jon or Dany who seem like adult brains in children’s bodies. But despite her naïveté, she’s a very engaging POV character. She’s perceptive, weighing all the possible meanings of things said to her and done around her, showing great political instinct despite a less-than-wholistic education. Most of all I love that she’s strong. She’s been through hell and it’s only made her wiser, not crueler or more vengeful or hateful. Where Arya has become pure self-destruction, Catelyn has become a paragon of vengeance, and Tyrion is all bitterness and self pity, Sansa is taking control of her life and using the agency available to her to advance her own interests without becoming a monster. Can’t wait to watch her calmly remove Littlefinger from the game board, then finish her lemoncake like a true QITN."" - u/Muffinman908

"" What makes Sansa such a good character is her simplicity. She doesn't have three dragons, a sword, or have any magical abilities (that we've seen yet, as I believe GRRM has said she is a warg), however, she's still an incredibly nuanced, interesting, and layered character. Her metamorphosis from naive teenage girl to hardened young woman is perhaps the best character arc in the entirey of ASOIAF. I also love how she has stayed true to herself throughout her journey in that she has never shunned her femininity and instead chosen to embrace it and simultaneously utilize it as a weapon (""A lady's armor is courtesy""). In short, I just love her and can't wait for her further development in TWOW/ADOS."" - u/EmFly15

Perhaps it is because I watched the show first, but I am very surprised as to how fluidly I am getting through these chapters, I very rarely have to go back and reread anything, and I do believe I have identified a few foreshadowing clues already.

I actually believed that I made a mistake buying these books because time and time again in the past I would tell myself that I wanted to try reading but would give up after a few weeks. I don't know, maybe it is because Im getting older (just turned 15).

444,"&gt; A Dance with Dragons - Daenerys I

&gt; “You have no lack of enemies, Your Grace. You can see their pyramids from your terrace. Zhak, Hazkar, Ghazeen, Merreq, Loraq, all the old slaving families. Pahl. Pahl, most of all. __A house of women now. Bitter old women with a taste for blood. Women do not forget. Women do not forgive.__”

&gt; _No_, Dany thought, _and the Usurper’s dogs will learn that, when I return to Westeros_. It was true that there was blood between her and the House of Pahl. Oznak zo Pahl had been cut down by Strong Belwas in single combat. His father, commander of Meereen’s city watch, had died defending the gates when Joso’s Cock smashed them into splinters. Three uncles had been among the hundred sixty-three on the plaza.

&gt; …

&gt; A Dance with Dragons - Tyrion II

&gt; The magister waggled his fat fingers. “Some contracts are writ in ink, and some in blood. I say no more.”

&gt; The dwarf pondered that. The Golden Company was reputedly the finest of the free companies, founded a century ago by Bittersteel, a bastard son of Aegon the Unworthy. When another of Aegon’s Great Bastards tried to seize the Iron Throne from his trueborn half-brother, Bittersteel joined the revolt. Daemon Blackfyre had perished on the Redgrass Field, however, and his rebellion with him. Those followers of the Black Dragon who survived the battle yet refused to bend the knee fled across the narrow sea, among them Daemon’s younger sons, Bittersteel, and hundreds of landless lords and knights who soon found themselves forced to sell their swords to eat. Some joined the Ragged Standard, some the Second Sons or Maiden’s Men. Bittersteel saw the strength of House Blackfyre scattering to the four winds, so he formed the Golden Company to bind the exiles together.

&gt; From that day to this, the men of the Golden Company had lived and died in the Disputed Lands, fighting for Myr or Lys or Tyrosh in their pointless little wars, and dreaming of the land their fathers had lost. They were exiles and sons of exiles, dispossessed and unforgiven … yet formidable fighters still.

&gt; “I admire your powers of persuasion,” Tyrion told Illyrio. “How did you convince the Golden Company to take up the cause of our sweet queen when they have spent so much of their history fighting _against_ the Targaryens?”

&gt; Illyrio brushed away the objection as if it were a fly. “Black or red, a dragon is still a dragon. __When Maelys the Monstrous died upon the Stepstones, it was the end of the male line of House Blackfyre.__” The cheesemonger smiled through his forked beard. “And Daenerys will give the exiles what Bittersteel and the Blackfyres never could. She will take them home.”

After the death of Maelys the Monstrous, House Blackfyre turned into a house of bitter old women with a taste for blood, just like House Pahl (both in the hands of the Targaryens nonetheless). The children raised by the surviving Blackfyre female leadership (possibly Illyrio and Varys) can only be bitter enemies to Targaryens. This is where Illyrio’s brushing away of Tyrion’s objections falls apart. The Blackfyres did not forget. The Blackfyres did not forgive.",asoiaf

447,"The Season 8 battle of winterfell was the most poorly scripted and arranged episode to date, and obviously not for lack of special effects. As I watched virtually all major characters be granted plot armor of inconceivable degrees, it became apparent that D&amp;D had become bored of killing main characters.  


I swear they went meta and decided to instead kill the series. As in kill virtually everything fans were attached to in the series. Semi-realistic battle scenes? Real sense of life and death? Intelligent characters plots and plans undone by other superior plots, chance, or chaos?  


I've only ever seen this to the same degree in video games, where some cut scene constructs some tense mood that you need to complete some level or mission in some amount of time or the entire stronghold or fortress will fall apart. But really you can just run in circles for five hours or spam killing things to level up or hunt for rare ""drops"". The same repeat loop of shaking walls and stones falling keeps playing, but there's really nothing behind it.  


I knew it was bad when the grand scheme of defense was too... leave all their best soldiers outside the walls and ramparts? A blind charge into the night with the dothraki rather than keeping them away for raiding? Only one defense line of ramparts? Not taking as much advantage of the lack of ranged weapons by the dead? Waiting way too long before employing dragons? No boiling oil?  


And why would the Night King risk himself at all? Why even attack so early? Why not raid and raid and raid and build the army and starve the living? All just for bad dramatic effect.   


And the effect on my engagement in the series was palpable. I felt virtually every connection and pleasure that remained with the TV series wane. The validity of the universe collapsed, like the entire army of the dead.   


I was already very well aware of how effort and attention was waning in the post-ADWD episodes, especially when the Reach was conquered in about ten minutes of screen time. HBO should have just taken production and direction from D&amp;D and given it to some other people with a bit more passion.   


But as it is, D&amp;D might as well have put a massive formation of dead bodies in the shape of a middle finger.",asoiaf
448,"There are a lot of characters in the books that just seem outright evil, but I think it's pretty obvious George tries to put shades of grey into them all. On top of that we only see some characters from the points of view of those that don't know them. There are plenty of characters who would seem evil if we only took one point of view (Jamie, Tyrion and even Ned). So are there any characters that you feel sorry for with this in mind?

I've always felt pretty bad for the Mountain, sure he has done a lot (Like seriously a lot) of awful things but lots of those things are anecdotal. He was always gunna turn out the way he was, his size and birth meant he'd be a very capable warrior and he presumably would have been led to believe this and proven right. But this poor guy is plagued with headaches that he cannot stop (no wander he killed a man for snoring) and hated by all for being what he was raised to be.

His fight with Oberyn made me feel super sorry for the guy, he is being constantly taunted during the one thing that seems to bring him solace (fighting). Plus he's not the brightest of guys so I wander how much of it all he understands, he's just a big kid really. A big murderous rapey kid.

450,"Perhaps this has been discussed before but it’s the first time I’ve noticed it. During my reread, I noticed Ned naming Jon’s mother with ""cool courtesy"". Out of curiosity I searched the term in A Search of Ice and Fire.

The phrase **cool courtesy** is used four times and each time it is used to hide a character’s true feelings or agenda.

The first time is during Ned’s conversation with Robert Baratheon regarding Jon’s mother in AGoT Eddard II:

&gt;“Her name was Wylla,” Ned replied with **cool courtesy**, “and I would sooner not speak of her.”

The second time is in AGoT Bran VI. Robb has called the north’s bannermen for war. Bran reflects that the bannermen all seem to be testing Robb in their own way.

&gt;Robb answered each of them with **cool courtesy**, much as Father might have, and somehow he bent them to his will.

The third time is in ASOS Catelyn IV. Perhaps this example is not as strong because the words “cool” and “courtesy” are not used next to each other and not for the same person. Lothar Frey is described as being the model of courtesy. Later on we discover he is one person responsible for the Red Wedding.

&gt;If Robb seemed **cool** at the table and Edmure surly, Lame Lothar made up for them both. He was the model of **courtesy**, reminiscing warmly about Lord Hoster, offering Catelyn gentle condolences on the loss of Bran and Rickon, praising Edmure for the victory at Stone Mill, and thanking Robb for the “swift sure justice” he had meted out to Rickard Karstark.

The final example is in AFFC Cersei VIII. Cersei brings Margery news of Loras being burned and dying.

&gt;Now you know how I felt, the night my Joffrey died. She bowed, her face a mask of **cool courtesy**. “Sweet daughter, I am so sad for you. I will leave you with your grief.”

All of these characters use cool courtesy to successfully mask their true feelings and further progress their goals except for Cersei. Margery correctly guesses why Cersei is telling her this information - because he’s a vile, cruel and wants power - yet Cersei still uses a mask of cool courtesy. She is unable to hide her agenda and this will lead to her downfall.

I find it interesting as a piece of supporting evidence for R+L = J. Taking into account how the phrase is used elsewhere in the books, the fact that Ned responds with cool courtesy implies he is hiding his true thoughts on the matter i.e. Wylla is not Jon’s mother.",asoiaf
451,"One of the reasons so many character arcs make so little sense in the television series is the way the book characters that were left out of the show were dissected into bits and pieces and then those chunks were given to characters that made it to the series to make sure that certain plot points still took place. Characters do things that originally were actions of other characters, even if that means that the end point of their arcs, which coincides with the end of their storylines in the novels, seems odd to say the least. Cersei inheriting parts of fAegon’s arc, for instance, is much speculated on on this subreddit.

So the question is: if the main plot points concerning the main characters still occur in the novels, whom will Daenerys burn as a traitor? Varys could still meet a fiery end, but Daenerys executing a traitor, or someone she thinks is a traitor, is a rather big plot point. It is also an action, which cannot have been taken from the arc of a “deleted” character. Varys does not serve her in the novels, so who among her councillors is the most likely candidate for ending his (or her) days in dragon fire? It would have to be someone close to her to be impactful. Jon, Tyrion and Greyworm can be ruled out, since they will make it to the end. Missandei is a possible although extremely unlikely option. That leaves Jorah and Barristan, and I am inclined to think the latter is more likely.

Barristan in the series is closer to the novel character than Jorah is. This would mean that the execution would have more impact on Tyrion and Jon. Tyrion, in particular, knows Barristan’s deeds and character very well. He is also a POV character, which means that his views on Daenerys are not only words spoken but also thoughts not shared with any other character. His history as Aerys’s bodyguard would add even more tragic aspects to his character’s end. He travelled far in the hope of finding a monarch worthy of serving, to once more find only fire and blood. There would also be interesting parallels with Jaime, a man he despises so much. Whether he would be an actual traitor or just a victim of Daenerys’s paranoia, the comparison would be unavoidable. Jaime chose to act. Would Barristan choose to act now too to save Westeros from Aerys’s daughter? Or would he face the same end that the people of KL would have suffered had Jaime not acted? And the inhabitants of KL will still burn, no matter what he does or does not do. Will there be people at his execution standing silently and doing nothing, much like there were when Aerys burnt the Starks? 

Do you think that Daenerys will execute someone as a traitor? If so, who do you think is the most likely person to be executed? My apologies if someone has already written about this.

Arya is on board a ship with a crew that can easily mutiny once they are out of reach of Westeros, no seafaring skills, and no back up ships.  The seas are crawling with pirates, or even worse Iron Men whose leader now has no love for the Starks, slavers, and who knows what dangerous beasties.  Looking at the exploration of Earth, she could very well pitch up on an island, be bitten by it's smallest wildlife, and be dead the next week from malaria.  

It would have been better to let the dust settle, be sure of relative peace with at least the Iron Islanders, and travel with more men, ships, maybe a red priestess or someone else with powers, or even ask Davos to come. (For that matter maybe Gendry can come to row any lifeboats).

In my opinion the GC is in the dark regarding young griffs true identity pretender or not the GC want to go to westeros.  I don't think the golden company supporting aegon really means anything.

455,"I was disappointed with Bran ending as king because I thought that there is no logic in it - Starks has no claim to the throne. I could imagine that in the books he will be elected by Great Council of which we have many details, especially in F&amp;B or WoIaF. So I thought, what would make lords of the Seven Kingdoms choose crippled boy, even in situation when there are no more viable claimants available and anyone could press his claim. There may be other factor, including his magical status but I think that if yes, they will both compliment each other given how magic is detached in Martin's world. So I started to look for some clues, hints or anything.

&amp;#x200B;

First thing is a conversation between Robert and Ned:

*Robert sat down again. ""Damn you, Ned Stark. You and Jon Arryn, I loved you both. What have you done to me? You were the one should have been king, you or Jon.""*

*""You had the* ***better*** ***claim***, Your Grace.""

&amp;#x200B;

This is obvious and very conspicious, why Ned said that Robert had **better** claim, not something like ""you had a claim"" or ""only you had a right to become a king"". So the way Martin put it implies that both Starks and Arryns or one of the houses had a claim, albeit weaker, to the Iron Throne. Arryn Targaryen marriage are known Rodrick and Daella, Aemma and Viserys I but still I couldn't find if any Targaryen princess married lord Arryn and provided next lord of the Vale. Daella Targaryen was the second wive of Rodrik, he had two sons from his first marriage. In World of Ice and Fire we can read:

*House Arryn can even boast the rare distinction of twice being deemed worthy of marriage with the blood of the dragon. Rodrik Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie, was honored by King Jaehaerys I Targaryen and his wife, the Good Queen Alysanne, with the hand of their daughter, Princess Daella, and a child of that union, the Lady Aemma Arryn, in turn became the first wife of King Viserys I Targaryen and mother to his firstborn child, Princess Rhaenyra, who contended with her half brother Aegon II for the Iron Throne. In that struggle, Jeyne Arryn, Lady of the Eyrie and Maiden of the Vale, proved a staunch friend to Rhaenyra Targaryen and her sons, ultimately serving as one of the regents for King Aegon III.* ***From that day, every Targaryen to sit the Iron Throne had a bit of Arrynblood.***

&amp;#x200B;

So we know that Targaryens have Arryn blood, but if Arryns have Targaryen blood we don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

As for Starks, we don't know it that well, from family tree in World of Ice and Fire we know that there where no marriages in last few generations. But as in the case of Arryns it is not a decisive argument, because both houses still could be related to Targaryens indirectly through marriages with houses which may have a Targaryen blood. It seems unlikely that any other house married to Targaryens. Among Ned's ancestors we have a Lock, Blackwood, Royce, Karstark, Glover. So only Blackwoods and Royce are houses outside of the North. Blackwoods have links with Targaryens as we know. Still it doesn't explain anything and there is no reason to dwell on it as for now.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, there is other conspicious line, by Greatjon:

&amp;#x200B;

*It was the dragons we* ***married***, and the dragons are all dead!""

&amp;#x200B;

This is a very strange phrase to use. It seems to be an euphemis of Torren Stark's bowing to Targaryens and it is, btw, how it was presented in the show:

&amp;#x200B;

""It was the Dragons we **bowed** to and now the Dragons are dead!""

&amp;#x200B;

On the surface it makes more sense so what if Martin phrase is a forshadowing of Starks claim to Iron Throne which will be showed to us only in the end, during final Great Council. If we assume that by that time Daenerys and fAegon will be dead and Jon exiled to the Watch or ""I don't want it"", could Bran have the best claim? What do you think? Are there any other clues out there?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit note: I forgot to ask, could someone explain to me, why there is *It* ***was*** *the dragons* instead of *It* ***were*** *the dragons.* Is it because ""was"" refers to ""it"" which is a singular form?",asoiaf

457,"Sorry if that passage was already given, but I stumbled on that passage while rereading the books.

A Storm of Sword, Arya Chapter, Page 593:

The Brotherhood Without banner is on top of High Heart and Thoros, Lem and Beric are sitting with the Dwarf Witch and she says this:

""I dreamt a wolf howling in the rain, but no one heard his grief,"" the dwarf woman was saying. ""I dreamt such a clangor I thought my head might burst, drums and horns and pipes and screams, but the saddest sound was the *little bells. I dreamt of a maid at a **feast with purple serpents in her hair, venom dripping from their fangs. And later I dreamt that maid again, slaying a savage giant in a castle built of snow"" She turned her head sharply and smiled through the gloom, right at Arya. ""You cannot hide from me, child. Come closer, now""*

And after that the dwarf women panic saying that Arya smell of death.

Now my theory is that the first part, the battle with the sad little bells, could be the burning of Kings Landing (it make sense in my head anyway) and the Maid would be Arya. The venom from her purple hair is used to kill Frey during is feast and the Savage Giant could be the Night King, the castle of snow Being Winterfell.

'A second, rival High King of Dorne also existed during the times of the First Men, ruling from a great wooden motte-and-bailey castle on the south bank of Greenwood near Lemonwood, where the river flows into the Summer Sea. This was a curious kingship, for whenever a king died, his successor was chosen by election from amongst a dozen noble families that had settled along the river or the eastern shores. The Wades, Shells, Holts, Brooks, Hulls, Lakes, Brownhills, and Briars all threw up kings who ruled from the high hall amongst the lemon trees, but in the end this curious system broke down when a disputed election set the royal houses to warring against one another. After a generation of conflict, three of the old houses were wiped from the earth, and the once-powerful river realm had shattered into a dozen quarrelsome petty kingdoms.'",asoiaf

462,"So in the series, we see that the Night's Watch is in urgent need of men. It's currently used as a prison of sorts, but most men would rather be gelded or die than spend their lives in service to the Night's Watch.

&amp;#x200B;

However, from Jon's chapters, I get the sense that for the youngest recruits, the Night's Watch acts sort of like a military school or training. Jon, Sam and their friends do a lot of maturing there.

&amp;#x200B;

Why not just make the Night's Watch a place where noble families can send off their 2nd and 3rd born sons for a few years? It might be hard to get them to send their heirs but I think such an idea could improve comradery between the houses. Sons of Northern houses interacting with lads from the Vale, Riverlands and Stormlands who they wouldn't normally get to see and build friendships with.

&amp;#x200B;

Let the smallfolk send their boys too. Most smallfolk as seen from Dunk and Egg and Jon's chapters have no idea how to fight with proper weapons having no prior training. Give them the promise of 3 meals a day, proper sword training and a bed to sleep in and I believe some would come.

&amp;#x200B;

I would make it a 3-5 year stint, eliminating the Watch's biggest drawback, serving for life and making the idea more likely to get off the ground in the first place. The older recruits could also train the younger ones during their final days. I can imagine a lot of Randall Tarlys (albeit not as big of a douchebag as the original version) sending their sons off to ""make men out of them"".

&amp;#x200B;

It also has to be remembered that not all the Night's Watchmen act as rangers and go beyond the wall, so for quite a number of recruits, the biggest danger would be the harsh conditions and wildings who manage to get past the wall.",asoiaf
463,"Can Theon Greyjoy still experience romantic or sexual attraction? After being tortured and castrated, his entire demeanour and personality (understandably) becomes extremely unassuming, relatively meek, and even a tad subservient even after he escapes and reunites with his sister again. We see Theon and Sansa grow rather close to each other, and both of them clearly have shared trauma and a great deal of affection and love for each other. Sansa seems to adore and appreciate Theon (like the way she shivers and almost cries when asking Theon if he isn’t coming with her in s6) and Theon is very protective of Sansa, so because of this a lot of people “ship” them together in a romantic way. But due to his lack of a sex organ (and so we can assume his sex drive and testosterone has depleted considerably) is he still capable of romantic/sexual feelings for anyone, or is his protectiveness of Sansa purely platonic and brotherly?",asoiaf
464,"Evan and I dive into the incredible story of Prince Egg and how he came to be known as Aegon the Unlikely. Find out how a crown prince came to be the squire of a hedge knight, his early promise and how the fourth son of a fourth son came to sit on the Iron Throne.

465," I haven't read through all the books yet, so I'm not sure about this, but can claimant kings and queens actually legitimize people? Robb does it with Jon, Daenerys (show) does it with Gendry. Both of them, however, are no true king/queen. They simply claim to be one, but have not been officially declared one. To me it seems weird that apparently anyone can claim to be king or queen and have legal legitimizations and other similar verdicts.",asoiaf
466,"Is the citadel in the lannister camp? If anyone knew about the genetics of hair it's them and yet they never raised the alarm. I know Pycelle is a lannister creature however when other high ranking archmaesters noticed this discrepancy in Robert's heirs they should have done something about it. But they did nothing.

Wyman says his maester, Theomore, is a Lannister of Lannisport (I know, I know, they abandon their family names and stuff but blood is thicker...) and is all head and no heart. Wyman knows he cannot rely on Theomore. I'm suspicious about those who would send such a measter to serve him since it seems like they positioned a maester with Lannister blood and a rigid commitment to reason above all else in the household of the wealthiest Northern lord. Almost as if they meant for Theomore to keep his lord loyal to the throne and have him rein Wyman in whenever he got ideas about supporting something like treason. The citadel sent Stannis a measter suited to serve one like Stannis as Cressen notes. However Wyman is sent a maester of Lannister blood who's nature is such that Wyman will not be able to freely rely on him possibly discouraging him from potential treason. 

So is Pycelle a reflection of the Citadel's loyalties?",asoiaf
467,"I know everyone was a bit disgruntled that Bran was dubbed ""Bran the Broken"" at the end of the show.

Now, I'm sure someone else has pointed this out before me, but these are the closing lines of Clash of Kings (and one of my favourite parts from any of Bran's chapters):

&gt; *The stone is strong.* Bran told himself, *the roots of the trees go deep, and under the ground the Kings of Winter sit their thrones.* So long as those remained, Winterfell remained. It was not dead, just broken. *Like me,* he thought. *I’m not dead either*.

Honestly I think it'd be kinda poetic if Bran the Broken does come to pass. I... don't dislike it.",asoiaf
468,"First of all I read a post here saying Sansa has become an unsympathetic character and why she’s destroyed the whole 7 kingdoms.  This is definitely false.

I can go over this a million times, Dany burning King’s landing had nothing to do with Sansa. If Dany can’t trust her best advisors including Tyrion and Varys with the knowledge that Jon has a right to the throne then the problem is that she accepts people who betray her and doesn’t know better. If she thought Jon would never tell anyone just because she asked him not to, then she doesn’t know Jon (Jon might be a Targaryen but at heart is still a Stark, family comes before anything. He represents the new Ned Stark in a lot of ways). 

Sansa is never going to accept an outsider because every suffering she had (the rape, torture, abuse) has been because an outsider (Robert Baratheon) came to Winterfell. Ramsey, Joffrey, Cersei, Littlefinger all were outsiders trying very hard to break her from the moment they met her. 

Now the problem I find with her character is a loss of a good character arc post - season 6. She had minimal screen time especially in S8. Well D&amp;D couldn’t have done worse to her character in any possible way. By making her story less important the Hound’s or Tormund’s (that giant story wasn’t important at all), they actively try to shove B-characters down our throats and instead destroy A-characters like Sansa and Jon (Especially the last season only destroyed almost all A-characters). 

Lastly, there was no reason she would want Dany on the throne. Dany had done nothing this season but show Sansa that she’s got her 2 dragons to do her bidding in everything and btw, 2 of them died very easily. Dany has made poor choices since she left Meereen. Killing the Tarly’s, etc.. 

Sansa is one of the best characters on the show who just didn’t get enough time. She was in no way responsible for Dany going mad and/or deaths of the millions of death in KL. 

People like to call Sansa as Cersei or Littlefinger but I think it’s absolutely false. Cersei or LF were actively trying to make wars for their benefits while Sansa tries to be as passive as possible. She’s more smarter, somewhat like Tywin, trying to burn the bridges when she gets there. 

Bring them downvotes.",asoiaf
469,"This part from Fire and Blood perfectly captures the best of Song of Ice and Fire.

470,"Just finished reading the first book of the series for the first time and these are the few things I wished they included in the show.


- The Starks’ bound with the Dire wolves. 

- Cersai tries to seduce Ned when he finds out the truth about her kids. ( I have no Idea why they didn’t include this in the show because it shows her character how she’s willing to try/do anything when backed into the corner) 

- Ned’s fever dream about the tower of the joy.

- When Ned’s letter to Stannis it’s found on one of his men. (it made more sense of his treason charges because they had solid proof)


My favorite part of the book is about how Rickon isn’t taking really his parents not being there for him.  

What are some of the things that you wish that they included in the show from the first book? What are your favorite parts from the first book?",asoiaf
471,"&gt; A Game of Thrones - Daenerys X

&gt; When the fire died at last and the ground became cool enough to walk upon, Ser Jorah Mormont found her amidst the ashes, surrounded by blackened logs and bits of glowing ember and the burnt bones of __man__ and __woman__ and __stallion__.

While I was skimming through the funeral pyre chapter where the dragons hatched, I noticed something curious. There seems to be three sacrifices that went into the pyre:

1. Drogo

1. Red stallion

1. Mirri Maz Duur

These three were slain in this order. Drogo by Dany’s hands and the other two by Dany’s orders. As a side note, the red stallion was not _the_ red stallion of Drogo because the original one was sacrificed by Mirri Maz Duur previously in order to treat Drogo.

The dragon eggs hatched in somewhat reverse order.

1. Viserion

1. Rhaegal

1. Drogon

In a way, the last sacrifice to die fueled the first dragon egg to hatch and it kept going like that, which means:

1. Mirri Maz Duur gave way to Viserion

1. Red stallion gave way to Rhaegal

1. Drogo gave way to Drogon

This made me wonder about the implications of the sacrifices and the eventual riders of these dragons.

&gt; A Storm of Swords - Daenerys IV

&gt; Drogon and Rhaegal were asleep atop some cushions, curled about each other, but Viserion perched on the edge of her empty bath. “Missandei, what language will these Yunkai’i speak, Valyrian?”

&gt; “Yes, Your Grace,” the child said. “A different dialect than Astapor’s, yet close enough to understand. The slavers name themselves the Wise Masters.”

&gt; “__Wise__?” Dany sat cross-legged on a cushion, and __Viserion__ spread his white-and-gold wings and flapped to her side. “We shall see how wise they are,” she said as she scratched the dragon’s scaly head behind the horns.

As Mirri Maz Duur told Dany in the funeral pyre chapter, maegi means “wise”. When Dany said “wise” in a later chapter, Viserion flapped to Dany’s side and she scratched his head. GRRM does this trick a lot. While something is happening in a scene, pay attention to what the dragons are doing in the background. This does make a lot of sense if a part of the spirit of the “wise woman” still lives in Viserion. It also has ominous foreshadowing that the rider of Viserion should at some point betray Dany, and it might be a controversial, messy, two-sided affair like the betrayal of Mirri Maz Duur.

Though the subject of another thread, it is highly foreshadowed that Tyrion will be the rider of Viserion. No doubt, he will be a “wise” adviser and serve Dany well. But sooner or later, we should expect a betrayal from him to Dany.

I am less certain about the fate of Rhaegal’s rider. The most important thing to remember is that it was not a person but a horse that went into the dragon. And it was a replacement for the original mount of Drogo. This might suggest that the relationship between Dany and the rider of Rhaegal might be business-like instead of being personal; as if Dany will use this dragonrider only as a mount to carry herself forward. This mount-like position of Rhaegal’s rider in the eyes of Dany might eventually lead to betrayal. It is foreshadowed by the [Two Betrayers](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Two_Betrayers) that the two dragonriders of Dany will betray her. The foreshadowing for the betrayal of the dragonriders is even stronger in the main text:

&gt; A Storm of Swords - Daenerys VI

&gt; *The dragon has three heads. There are two men in the world who I can trust, if I can find them. I will not be alone then. We will be three against the world, like Aegon and his sisters.*",asoiaf
472,"Since Book Cersei is hilariously wrong about many things, I wonder if she's completely wrong about *everything.* If that's the case, what can we deduce to be true? For example, in AFFC Cersei II: 

&gt; I will see you dead, old woman, Cersei promised herself as the Queen of Thorns tottered off between her towering guardsmen, a pair of seven-footers that it amused her to call Left and Right. We'll see how sweet a corpse you make. The old woman was twice as clever as her lord son, that was plain. 

If Cersei is always wrong, Olenna will outlive her, and Mace Tyrell is clever. 

&gt;""I would be a poor informer if I did not, Your Grace."" Qyburn seated himself between Orton Merryweather and Gyles Rosby.  
&gt;  
&gt;My councillors. Cersei had uprooted every rose, and all those beholden to her uncle and her brothers. In their places were men whose loyalty would be to her. She had even given them new styles, borrowed from the Free Cities; the queen would have no ""masters"" at court beside herself. Orton Merryweather was her justiciar, Gyles Rosby her lord treasurer. Aurane Waters, the dashing young Bastard of Driftmark, would be her grand admiral.  
&gt;  
&gt;And for her Hand, Ser Harys Swyft.

Qyburn, Merryweather, Rosby, Waters and Swyft are not loyal to Cersei.",asoiaf
473,"ACoK, don't know the page number because I have the Kindle books, Cat's chapter with Renly just before his assassination:

&amp;#x200B;

*""Let the three of you call for a Great Council, such as the realm has not seen for a hundred years. We will send to Winterfell, so* ***Bran may tell his tale*** *and all men may know the Lannisters for the true usurpers.* ***Let the assembled lords of the Seven Kingdoms choose who shall rule them.****""*

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have no doubt whatsoever that Martin's version will be 100x better. On a reread of the series, everything that was good on the show is brilliant in the books, and everything that was mediocre on the show is tense and exciting in the books. Dany's turn to extreme, psychopathic villainy and Bran's lacklustre ascension to the throne were the two most off putting plot points for me, but on a reread I'm convinced that Martin's version will be satisfying in a way the show never was.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think?",asoiaf
474,"Let’s play all this out. Sansa doesn’t deliberately expose Jon’s secret. Ergo Tyrion doesn’t tell Varys. Daenerys doesn’t feel isolated from John. Daenerys still takes King’s Landing, but doesn’t burn the city.

Daenerys rules KL with probably essentially the same small council as we get in the end. Except with Varys and/or Bran as Master of Whispers and somebody competent as Master of Coin. Maybe Jon gets named Master of War instead of Gray Worm, or he gets a seat Just Because.

In any case, Jon likely stays in King’s Landing with Dany, leaving Sansa to rule the North in his stead. Jon would very likely technically be Warden of the North, but Sansa would be ruling Winterfell. Jon probably doesn’t want to be ruling Winterfell anyway.

And ultimately, Jon would wield a huge amount of influence with Daenerys by dint of his claim to the throne. Sure, she could kill him if he tried to exercise it, but she loves him. Short of a dragon, Winterfell would probably get anything imaginable that it asked for.

Now, no, it’s not the same as being a Queen. But it’s still ruling. It’s a compromise that’s better for everybody overall, and compromising your dreams is a part of growing up. Sansa’s daughter would have a good chance of being Queen. Daenerys and Yara would be the precedents for a matriarchal monarchy. They also would have armies who back them personally, not by proxy. Jon legitimately doesn’t want that much power and would defer any attempts by people to defer to him rather than Daenerys.

It’s also a more stable realm. The Iron Islands backed Daenerys and know they’re getting independence. Dorne, Highgarden, and Winterfell all explicitly backed Daenerys. The Vale fought with her against the Dead. The Riverlands are too decimated to do anything but follow the status quo. The Stormlands are stuck with Gendry, but he’s at least a Baratheon who was legitimized by the sitting Queen and can be expected to wield influence. Yeah the Westerlands are probably pissed, but Tyrion probably does what he can as Hand to see that they’re taken care of.

On top of all that, there’d now be an independent army loyal to the crown in the form of the Unsullied and the Dothraki. Not sure how that’s going to go for more than one generation, but presumably they’d train recruits.

And just to take the cake: if and when the Iron Islands is recognized as an independent nation, everybody will know it’s an option and will be “free to ask” for independence as well. Including Sansa. But then, I doubt she could work up the public support for it because... why bother seceding when your guy is already the Queen’s boyfriend or the King?

After all, the North appointed Jon as King, not Sansa. Jon fought with them and worried about the survival of all the living, while Sansa was more worried about having her own personal army. And Sansa was willing to let Stark soldiers die to make sure Jon didn’t wait for the Vale and implicitly subsume it into “his” army. And when Sansa did get her own army, she murdered the guy that delivered it to her (however rotten Littlefinger might be).

Sansa only worries about the North once she feels like Jon is neglecting the North (also her only claim to power). Which he does because he’s worried about the survival of the living. Jon is also 100% correct, as they win by the skin of their teeth. But Sansa intentionally breaks John’s trust to sow discontent among Daenerys’ inner circle, to devastating effect.

So yeah, manipulating the good guys (Jon, Dany, etc) into turning evil and murdering a half million people and each other for personal power is the backstory of a villain, not a heroine. While we can cut Sansa some slack because acquiring power is even more of an uphill battle for her, she also appears to use it primarily at the expense of everyone else.

(As for everyone else: Let’s get real, Cersei and Jaime aren’t gonna get far in a rowboat. Jaime has one hand and Cersei probably doesn’t know how to row. They’re gonna be imprisoned and/or executed. Euron probably still dies or ends up with Jaime and Cersei in the rowboat doing the rowing. The Mountain probably kills the Hound and some Unsullied, then gets killed by Dragonfire. Qyburn probably still gets killed by the Mountain. It’s pretty unlikely any of them are going to drum up enough support to challenge Daenerys).

TL,DR: Sansa set back women’s rights in the rest of Westeros and got half a million people killed so she could be queen *now*, instead of ‘just’ being the operational ruler of the North while laying a superior groundwork for future generations.

EDIT: The North is also in a terrible position as an independent kingdom. It is thoroughly devastated by winter and warfare. Bran is the King, but the extent of his loyalty to Sansa is thoroughly unknown. No one else on the small council has strong ties to it. It’s implicated in razing, raping, and looting of KL and the entire apparatus of government is just *gone*. The Crown is preoccupied with rebuilding itself. It’s very unlikely that the North will get any men or material aid. 

The Iron Islands has ample motive to resent the North and raid it, and the Crown has no obligation to defend the North. Sansa also spurned the leader of the the Riverlands, and the Night’s Watch is headed up by Jon, who she fucked over. Sansa managed to give all her potential trade partners and allies reason to hate her.",asoiaf

478,"Hey everyone, first time posting.

I've thought about it a bit after playing the red dead games and finishing Game of Thrones and I feel like they share a number of character traits that'd be fun to compare.

-Both have an idealistic vision of how the world should be free of tyranny (savage utopia free from the US government vs breaking the wheel of oppression).

-Both are presented to be fairly altruistic with Dany freeing slaves and Dutch being a Robin Hood figure. 

-Their descent into 'madness' is largely due to the death of somebody who acted as their counterbalance (Hosea and Jorah) aswell as the uncertain loyalty of those who follow them (Arthur and Jon being a better alternative as a leader also plays a role).

-It's not clear whether they went mad or just showed their true colours in the end.

-When All of the above happens, their ideals fail, and start to realise those around them no longer love them, they start needlessly killing innocent people in the guise of a 'sacrifice' and 'necessity' because they can't handle losing. In the end, they revelled in being the saviour but not necessarily the act of saving people, when people rejected them their facade falls apart.

-They both end up being killed by Jo(h)n, someone who loved them but ultimately had no choice if they wanted to keep their family safe.

Overall I think both characters represent the end of an old era. Dany is the last of the bloodline monarchy and Dutch is the last of the Western outlaws.

485,"I’ve noticed some similarities between these characters while reading *A Clash of Kings* and wondered if the smart people of this subreddit could tell me what it means.

**Craster**

Craster reminds me of Joffrey and Ramsay. All three are bastards, and get angry when reminded of it.

&gt;”He was never fed,” said Dirk. “Not proper. That bastard Craster starved him dead.” Sam looked around anxiously, but Craster had not returned to the hall. If he had, things might have grown ugly. The wildling hated bastards, though rangers said he was baseborn himself, fathered on a wildling woman by some long-dead crow.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;”Bloody bastard!” Sam heard one of the Garths curse. He never saw which one. “Who calls me bastard?” Craster roared, sweeping platter and meat and wine cups from the table with his left hand while lifting the axe with his right. It’s no more than all men know,” Karl answered.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;But no sooner had that one been dragged away than a knight of solemn mien with a fiery heart on his surcoat shouted out, “Stannis is the true king! A monster sits the Iron Throne, an abomination born of incest!”… Joffrey lurched to his feat. “I’m king! Kill him! Kill him now! I command it.” He chopped down with his hand, a furious, angry gesture…and screeched in pain when his arm brushed against one of the sharp metal fangs that surrounded him. 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;If I had a tail, the Bastard would have cut it off. The thought came unbidden, a vile thought, dangerous. His lordship was not a bastard anymore. Bolton, not Snow. The boy king on the Iron Throne had made Lord Ramsay legitimate, giving him the right to use his lord father’s name. Calling him Snow reminded him of his bastardry and sent him into a black rage.


Like Craster, Joffrey was fathered by a member of an order sworn to take no wife.

&gt;”Dolorous Edd says Craster’s a terrible savage. He marries his daughters and obeys no laws but those he makes himself. **And Dywen told Grenn he’s got black blood in his veins. His mother was a wildling woman who lay with a ranger**, so he’s a bas…” Suddenly he realized what he was about to say. “A bastard.” Jon said with a laugh. “You can say it, Sam. I’ve heard the word before.”

This is a stretch, but both Joffrey and Craster are at times connected to crossbows and rabbits.

&gt;We ate the rabbit, if that’s what you came for.” The admission made him feel absurdly guilty. “Old Lord Crow, him with the talking bird, he gave Craster a crossbow worth a hundred rabbits.” 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;Lord Petyr was seated on his window seat, languid and elegant in a plush plum-colored doublet and a yellow satin cape, one gloved hand resting on his knee. “The king is fighting hares with a crossbow,” he said. “The hares are winning.”

While small, these similarities to Craster reinforced the parallels I noticed between Gilly and two other young women fleeing in the story, Sansa and Jeyne Poole.

**Gilly And Sansa**

Gilly’s situation in *A Clash of Kings* reminds me of Sansa.

Gilly asks for help from a burned man, and so does Sansa.

&gt;Mormont frowned. “A dead man tried to kill me. How well could I be?” He scratched under his chin. His shaggy beard had been singed in the fire, and he’d hacked it off. The pale stubble of his new whiskers made him look old, disreputable, and grumpy. “You do not look well. How is your hand?” “Healing.” Jon flexed his bandaged fingers to show him. He had burned himself more badly than he knew throwing the flaming drapes, and his right hand was swathed in silk halfway to the elbow. At the time he’d falet nothing; the agony had come after. His cracked red skin oozed fluid, and fearsome blood blisters rose between his fingers, big as roaches. The maester says I’ll have scars, but otherwise the hand should be as good as it was before.”
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;The woman knelt on the icy ground. “M’lord, I beg you—“ “Don’t beg me anything. Go back to your hall, you shouldn’t be here. We were commanded not to speak to Craster’s women.” “You don’t have to speak with me, m’lord. Just take me with you, when you go, that’s all I ask.” *All she asks*, he thought. *As if that were nothing*.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;Ser Meryn and Ser Arys followed him out, but Sandor Clegane lingered long enough to yank her roughly to her feet. “Save yourself some pain, girl, and give him what he wants.” “**What…what does he want? Please, tell me**.” “He wants you to smile and smell sweet and be his lady love,” the Hound rasped. “He wants to hear you recite all your pretty little words the way the septa taught you. He wants you to love him…and fear him.”

Gilly asking Jon for help is reversed when Sandor offers to rescue Sansa.

&gt;“I could keep you safe,” he rasped. “They’re all afraid of me. No one would hurt you again, or I’d kill them.” 

Like Sandor, Jon cannot help Gilly. Gilly belongs to Craster, a friend of the Night’s Watch, and Sansa is a captive of Joffrey, who Sandor serves as a member of his Kingsguard. 

&gt;Her fear was plain on her face. “You will come back, though. When your warring’s done, you’ll pass this way again.” “We may.” *If any of us still live*. “**That’s for the Old Bear to say, the one you call Lord Crow. I’m only his squire. I do not choose the road I ride**.”

Both Jon and Sandor deny false titles.

&gt;She wiped her hands on her skirt. “M’lord—“ “I’m no lord.” But others had come crowding around, drawn by the woman’s scream and the crash of the rabbit hutch. “Don’t you believe him, girl,” called out Lark the Sisterman, a ranger mean as a cur. “That’s Lord Snow himself.” “Bastard of Winterfell and brother to kings,” mocked Chett, who’d left his hounds to see what the commotion was about.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;”You rode gallantly today, Ser Sandor,” she made herself say. Sandor Clegane snarled at her. “Spare me your empty compliments, girl…and your ser’s. I am no knight. I spit on them and their vows.”

Both Sansa and Gilly are given cloaks. 

&gt;Crouched atop the rock that had sheltered him during the night was the rabbit keeper, wrapped in a black cloak so large it drowned her. *Sam’s cloak*, Jon realized at once. *Why is she wearing Sam’s cloak?*
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;“The fat one, that Sam, he said to see you. He give me his cloak, so no one would say I didn’t belong.” 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;I wish the Hound were here. The night of the battle, Sandor Clegane had come to her chambers to take her from the city, but Sansa had refused. Sometimes she lay awake at night, wondering if she’d been wise. She had his stained white cloak hidden in a cedar chest beneath her summer silks. She could not say why she’d kept it.

In the chapter where he meets Gilly, Jon also thinks of Sansa. 

&gt;He found himself thinking of his sisters, perhaps because he’d dreamed of them last night.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;“I don’t even know your name.” “Gilly, he called me. For the gillyflower.” “That’s pretty.” He remembered Sansa telling him once that he should say that whenever a lady told him her name. He could not help the girl, but perhaps the courtesy would please her. 

If Jon is Sandor, then Sam is Ser Dontos, who helps Sansa escape the Red Keep.

&gt;The first time he’d seen Craster’s Keep, Gilly had come begging for help, and Sam had lent her his black cloak to conceal her belly when she went to find Jon Snow. *Knights are supposed to defend women and children*.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt; “Sweet lady, I would be your Florian” Dontos said humbly, falling to his knees before her…”Thank you, sweet lady.” Ser Dontos lurched clumsily to his feet, and brushed earth and leaves from his knees. “Your lord father was as true a man as the realm has ever known, but I stood by and let them slay him. I said nothing, did nothing…and yet, when Joffrey would have slain me, you spoke up. Lady, I have never been a hero, no Ryam Redwyne or Barristan the Bold. I’ve won no tourneys, no renown in war…but I was a knight once, and you have helped me remember what that meant. My life is a poor thing, but it is yours.” Ser Dontos placed a hand on the gnarled bole of the heart tree. He was shaking, she saw. “I vow, with your father’s gods as witness, that I shall send you home.”
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;My poor Florian, she thought, as he wiped his mouth with a floppy sleeve. Dress dark, he’d said, yet under his brown hooded cloak he was wearing his old surcoat; red and pink horizontal stripes beneath a black chief bearing three gold crowns, the arms of House Hollard. “Why are you wearing your surcoat? Joff decreed it was death if you were caught dressed as a knight again, he…oh…” Nothing Joff had decreed mattered any longer. “I want to be a knight. For this, at least.”

What is the point of these similarities? Could they show us Sandor’s confused feelings towards Sansa?

&gt;“I told her…” He swallowed. “*What?* That we’d take her with us?” Sam’s fat face blushed a deep red. “On the way home.” He could not meet Jon’s eyes. “She’s going to have a baby.” “Sam, have you taken leave of all your sense? We may not even return this way. And if we do, do you think the Old Bear is going to let you pack off one of Craster’s wives?” “I thought…maybe by then I could think of a way…” “I have no time for this, I have horses to groom and saddle.” Jon walked away as confused as he was angry. Sam’s heart was as big as the rest of him, but for all his reading he could be as thick as Grenn at times. It was impossible, and dishonorable besides. *So why do I feel so ashamed?*

**Gilly And Jeyne Poole**

Gilly’s situation and escape with Sam also reminded me of Jeyne Poole. 

Both happen in the aftermath of a violent meal.

&gt;“So young,” said Wyman Manderly. “Though mayhaps this was a blessing. Had he lived, he would have grown up to be a Frey.” Ser Hosteen slammed his foot into the tabletop, knocking it off its trestles, back into Lord Wyman’s swollen belly. Cups and platters flew, sausages scattered everywhere, and a dozen Manderly men came cursing to their feet. Some grabbed up knives, platters, flagons, anything that might serve as a weapon.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt; “*Who calls me bastard?*” Craster roared, sweeping platter and meat and wine cups from the table with his left hand while lifting the axe with his right. “It’s no more than all men know,” Karl answered. Craster moved quicker than Sam would have believed possible, vaulting across the table with axe in hand. A woman screamed, Garth Greenaway and Orphan Oss drew knives, Karl stumbled back and tripped over Ser Byam lying wounded on the floor. One instant Craster was coming after him spitting curses. The next he was spitting blood. Dirk had grabbed him by the hair, yanked his head back, and opened his throat ear to ear with one long slash. Then he gave him a rough shove, and the wildling fell forward, crashing face first across Ser Byam.

Both Gilly and Jeyne offer to wed if they are rescued. 

&gt;“You don’t have to speak with me, m’lord. Just take me with you, when you go, that’s all I ask.” *All she asks*, he thought. *As if that were nothing*. “I’ll…I’ll be your wife, if you like. My father, he’s got nineteen now, one less won’t hurt him none.” “Black brothers are sworn never to take wives, don’t you know that?
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;Gilly was crying. “Me and the babe. Please. I’ll be your wife, like I was Craster’s.”
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;“Help me.” She clutched at him. “Please. I used to watch you in the yard, playing with your swords. You were so handsome.” She squeezed his arm. “If we ran away, I could be your wife, or your…your whore…whatever you wanted.

Gilly and Jeyne both make the offer to emasculated men: Gilly to the fat, craven Sam and Jeyne to tortured, castrated Theon.

&gt;You said you’d help me,” Gilly reminded him. “I said Jon would help you. Jon’s brave, and he’s a good fighter, but I think he’s dead now. I’m a craven. And fat. Look how fat I am. Besides, Lord Mormont’s hurt. Can’t you see? I couldn’t leave the Lord Commander.” 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;“You could be my man.” Theon wrenched his arm away from her. “I’m no…I’m no one’s man.”

Both of them are saved from their pursuit. Gilly and Sam by Coldhands at Whitetree, and Jeyne and Theon by Crowfood Umber.

Is there any meaning to these similarities? Could the fate of Jeor point to Roose’s future?

&gt;The Lord Commander stood over Craster’s corpse, dark with anger. “The gods will curse us,” he cried. “there is no crime so foul as for a guest to bring murder into a man’s hall. By all the laws of the hearth, we—“ “There are no laws beyond the Wall, old man. Remember?”…”Hold your tongue,” Ollo warned. Instead the Lord Commander grabbed for his dagger. Ollo had only one hand, but that was quick. He twisted free of the old man’s grasp, shoved the knife into Mormont’s belly, and yanked it out again, all red. And then the world went mad.",asoiaf

&amp;#x200B;

Despite it's flaws, arguably the most important image of the finale is that of [Aegon Targaryen (Jon Snow) kneeling to Bran the Broken](https://i.redd.it/9wyd3et7px531.jpg). While I'm skeptical that Jon will be named Aegon in the books, this image symbolizes the conceptual core of the ending, which is the old narrative being supplanted by the new.

Though Tyrion's speech about Bran's story seems to come from left field, it's definitely from Martin, because it reflects something the show did not set up, but the books do. Bran's chapters are filled with recollections of Old Nan's stories, and his fixation on them. Of the Long Night, the Night's King, Bran the Builder, the Rat Cook, the Knight of the Laughing Tree, Brave Danny Flint, the Pact, and the Last Hero. These stories not only tend to repeat themselves during asoiaf as an indication of the cyclical nature of human history, they're also the legends which define the Seven Kingdoms.

The Seven Kingdoms as they exists during the story are ruled by the Iron Throne and thus built by the story of Aegon's Conquest. A story of submission through violence, and power achieved through force. Regardless of the exact truth of it, this is the story around which the Seven Kingdoms are unified.

I've often compared Daenerys to Don Quixote, and both characters are in many ways there to explore the positive and negative potential of stories to shape the human soul. For example Dany is essentially poisoned by Viserys' perspective of the world. Like the character of Don Quixote, the stories Daenerys fills her head with inevitably lead her (for good and then ill) to become a liberator, and then a tyrant. Like Quixote, and like Dany, the Seven Kingdoms are also built on stories, many of which set a violent precedent.

The story of Bran the Broken is significant because it sets a new precedent. It's a story of resilience, understanding, and finally choice. Bran's story is not about becoming a great warrior, but a wise shaman. When Tyrion says  *""who has a better story than Bran the Broken?""* it's not about whether his is the best or most interesting story in your opinion (though it is in mine), it's about his being the ideal story to supplant the story of the Iron Throne. The old story was about how the most powerful man in the world forced everyone to submit to his will, yet the new story is about how everyone got together and chose a broken boy.

So is the new story true? Did *everyone* choose Brandon Stark? Wasn't it just a bunch of powerful nobles? Did they choose him for his story? or because they preferred a seemingly weak king after the terror of Daenerys Targaryen?

You see, the story doesn't need to be completely true. And it won't achieve everlasting peace and stability. Similarly, the ancient legends around which the Seven Kingdoms were each built are likely not completely true nor perfect precedents.   The point is aspiring to a better ideal than glory through war. The hope of the ending is that the right story can inspire people to create a better world. Which is actually pretty cool.

He didn’t do anything that the others didn’t do and Saera never accuses him of anything specifically. Why was Jaehaerys’s punishment so much greater for him?",asoiaf
496,"I’m doing a book reread and I noticed this passage when Jon is riding with the wildlings in ASOS....

“The giants swayed slowly atop the mammoths as they rode past two by two. Jon’s garron shied, frightened by such strangeness, but whether it was the mammoths or their riders that scared him it was hard to say. Even Ghost backed off a step, baring his teeth in a silent snarl. The direwolf was big, but the mammoths were a deal bigger, and there were many and more of them.”

Why aren’t there more direwolves?  Especially north of the wall. Obviously the Stark direwolves are likely the only ones south of the wall, but we never run into or see them north of the wall. There are regular wolves... and apparently lots of mammoths, according to Jon. It doesn’t seem like they’re extinct or anything. No one north of the wall seems surprised to see Ghost - they’re impressed that he’s Jon’s pet/warg animal (spirit animal?? Not sure of the terminology there)- but they are not surprised he exists. It just seems kinda weird that Jon sees more mammoths than wild direwolves north of the wall.",asoiaf

&gt;**""It should have been you,"" she told him. Then she turned back to Bran and began to weep, her whole body shaking with the sobs. Jon had never seen her cry before.**

In consideration of how George R. R. Martin makes use is foreshadowing or bitter irony (Arya wishing the princess promised to a Frey dead, not knowing she was said princess; Melisandre wishing to see Azor Ahai and is only shown Snow), it had only just occurred to me that Cat’s strangely harsh words should could be the most bitter of them all.

The idea that Bran will be the new king when we’re led to believe time and time again that Jon Snow is one of the forerunners to come out on top at the end, is what we now expect to come at the end of the books. That’s mostly thanks to the show, GRRM telling D&amp;D the basic points, albeit much less nuance likely.

We consider everything that prepares Jon to be this destined hero, this secret princely bastard, born to the path that would make him understand both those who had lots in life less than he but still able to stand and speak with those of higher placing than he. He lives as a royal bastard, he lives as a man of the Night’s Watch among the dregs of society, he lives and understands the free folk, his perceptions are constantly challenged and he grows from them. 

Jon Snow effectively is the Hero’s Journey of A Song Of Ice And Fire. The monomyth if you will. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey

And Bran makes it meaningless on purpose.

We are shown this story time and time again while perhaps it’s truly Bran’s story. Bran gets crippled yes, but in his handicap he is eventually made more powerful, able to potentially supersede everyone else’s destinies. Jon, Dany, fAegon, Cersei, whatever contributions or efforts they will make towards claiming the kingdom whether by force or epic destiny, Bran will blow right past them by virtue of his life being set on a course.

It doesn’t so much matter if he will in the books become a hivemind of the COTF, of Bloodraven or simply be changed by his powers in such a way that he will be the true greatest threat never seen coming. What he will gain in those caves, the powers pretty much unseat any epic destinies, prophecies. None of it matters because his very purpose is cutting across the journey of Jon’s.

I know this is all understood, but like I said... It was there from the beginning. It should have been Jon. 

It simply wasn’t.",asoiaf

A Storm of Swords - Bran IV:

&gt;

&gt; As the sun began to set the shadows of the towers lengthened and the wind blew harder, sending gusts of dry dead leaves rattling through the yards. The gathering gloom put Bran in mind of another of Old Nan's stories, the tale of Night's King. He had been the thirteenth man to lead the Night's Watch, she said; a warrior who knew no fear. ""And that was the fault in him,"" she would add, ""for all men must know fear."" **A woman was his downfall; a woman glimpsed from atop the Wall, with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars.** Fearing nothing, he chased her and caught her and loved her, though her skin was cold as ice, and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well.

&gt;**He brought her back to the Nightfort and proclaimed her a queen and himself her king, and with strange sorceries he bound his Sworn Brothers to his will.** For thirteen years they had ruled, Night's King and his corpse queen, till finally the Stark of Winterfell and Joramun of the wildlings had joined to free the Watch from bondage. After his fall, when it was found he had been sacrificing to the Others, all records of Night's King had been destroyed, his very name forbidden.

Since George himself requested the alternate coloring for the miniature there must be some connection to Mel and The Others, especially when you consider the tale of the Night's King from Bran IV.

501,"DISCLAMER: This is my unpopular opinion about it so, thanks in advance for being civilized.

&amp;#x200B;

It is undeniable how this show has grown in fans throughout the years, myself included. I have been following the show since season 4 aired. So yeah, I have been watching since George R.R. Martin books were the core of the show and I have experienced the same feelings same as **you**, and most fans of the show. I have hated it, loved it, raged at it, loved it again and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

I rarely do reviews but I have to say, I cannot hold in what I have to say about this show anymore. So here is my opinion on the show. I will be comparing it to other big franchises and why I am still satisfied with the way writers David Benioff and D.B Weiss handled familiar situations to wrap up this excellent show. That being said, let’s dive right in and lets talk about..

&amp;#x200B;

**The obvious downsides I decided to let pass**

&amp;#x200B;

**“Plot armor”.** This is something we have stumbled across several times in movies in general, this is not a new thing. But for some reason, Game of Thrones seems to be taking so much backlash about it, and this is why I think it makes no sense to complain about it.

&amp;#x200B;

*Lord of the Rings has plot armor:* LOTR is my deity when it comes to movie entertainment, so don’t get me wrong, this is a top nodge quality trilogy I will always set as an example on how storytelling should be done. Nevertheless, to mention but some examples. Remember that bit in The Fellowship of the Ring when Aragorn, after speaking with Frodo after being chased down by Boromir, He turns around and there is a surreal amount of Uruk-Hai ready to dismember Aragorn’s body off? Well, somehow he survives! Oh, and he survives an even greater number of orcs at the main gates of Rohan gloriously riding down a bridge on **a horse**. That sounds familiar.. right Jon? I mean, If that is not plot armor, I don’t know how to call it.  Remember when Frodo and Sam where trying to sneak past the lines of orcs in Mordor to get to mount doom? I mean, how realistic is to think that starting a riot will distract their attention when they were technically already spotted (and that is the director’s cut so yeah, it’s Peter Jackson’s vision, same as D&amp;D had their own in GoT)... right Arya?... oh and what about Legolas perfect aiming? Oh yeah, Gandalf surviving Balrog, Frodo surviving in… in general? And don’t get me started on the eagles man (effective problem solvers indeed). And, why not? It is a fantasy world after all, just like Westeros is. Anyways, like I said. LOTR trilogy will always be an example. It’s epic and I love it completely.

&amp;#x200B;

*Star Wars has plot armor:* Star Wars has a background history on being divisive. Fans have complained about creative decisions that both prequels and sequels have made. Nevertheless, there is no denying that it's fanbase is one of the biggest and most influential out there, and despite its flaws, Star Wars is still loved by many, myself included. The reception of the movie that started the new trilogy, The Force Awakens, had a tremendous acclaim from both critics and fans. But it seems to me that everyone chose to overlook the fact that its main character Rey, had a plot armor as thick as a blast door shield. There is no build up whatsoever to explain why Rey was just so OP in literally every aspect of her character. She was unbelievably powerful for no reason. Mandtrick pro, badass pilot, experienced force user and she also successfully defeated a trained young enraged Jedi assassin even when she never held a lightsaber in her life. Sadly, it made the character blend, uninteresting and a bit tedious to me. But nobody seems to care much about it, and I am fine with that. But I mean, I prefer to believe that the Iron Fleet had exceptional aiming skills at moving targets, with the exception of aiming Drogon of course, or watch Whitewalkers wasting an entire castle and see a few main characters surviving it, or Raeghal’s blue fire conveniently being less damaging in some scenes, cuz at least that had some build up… right? Fantasy guys.. you get ‘wut Im’ suyn’?

&amp;#x200B;

**“Writing Issues”.** Jeez guys, If I had a dollar for every time this has been mentioned I’d own Dubai by now, literally. And I get it, Game of Thrones has some writing issues BUT, that doesn't mean it ruined the whole series and here is why..

&amp;#x200B;

*Avangers: Endgame has writing issues:* I know this might be a sacrilege and a complete unpopular opinion but before you start salming about it, I did enjoy the movie a lot, I’ve watched all of the MCU and I liked most of what they offered us in the final installment. I say most of it because it did have some problems with its writing, for example -T I M E  T R A V E L-. I have to admit that they did a great job at being consistent on what that concept involves, but man.. Nebula killing Nebula? c’mon! Some of you will come up with some weird theory or comic related material that I honestly have not read, but if I have to go out of my way and buy a whole bunch of comics to fill a gap that the movie wasn’t capable enough to explain in a logical way on its own.. Sorry but that means that there is a writing problem there. Plus, after all the epic battle scene where literally millions of bad aliens fight against humans and other good aliens. Well, after that horde of supernatural beings hit the Earth and puny **humans** fight them bravely... They survive!...well, most of them tho. And then again .. was there even an aftermath? I mean, if we had that today in NY I'm pretty sure I would notice that a big portion of the Earth is at least 80% gone or in a post cataclysmic state to say the very least. But no probs, we can just let our imagination wonder enough to let go of the questions before we get to Tony’s emotional scene that had me in tears for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

*Star Wars has writing issues:* Game of Thrones whole point was to tell us for 7 seasons that the great power that lies beyond the wall is nothing compared to the South little squabbles for power. So many hours invested in theory making and we finally get to see it.. The Long Night airs. We waited so long to see the great battle of Westeros and turns out to be over in ONE episode. Love it. The reason? Well, why not? I mean, nobody seems to care that the whole point of the Star Wars story was about this “chosen one” and what not, and then, after falling to the dark side he gets redemption by saving his son and pass on his legacy to future generations. Suddenly the prequels “came out of nowhere” just like Arya did, to set this new super Jedi girl as some kind of new chosen one I assume? And left the whole Anakin redemption thing completely obliviated, because his grandson wants to follow his bad example? I mean, that was not the point of Anakin’s story arc, was it? And yet, Kylo turns out to be an appealing character. Even though we know so much about his background, we can still enjoy episode 9 and look forward to it, right?. And yes, I know Game of Thrones S08E03 is just as dark as the Devil’s ass, but there's always that VLC option to fix the video brightness just right. Awesome episode, and not to mention that it has two of the most meaningful and emotional the deaths of the entire series. One of them being one of my all time favorite characters, Theon Greyjoy. What is dead may never die my man.

&amp;#x200B;

**“Character development issues”.** YES! You all have made your point quite clear about Daenerys burning King’s Landing. I personally think D&amp;D were hinting that event for quite a while, so it did shock me, but I was kind of expecting it. Yes! Jamie returning to Cersei, Arya not killing Cersei, Arya sailing west of Westeros, and last but not least…. Bran crowned king of the six kingdoms. Loved it. It was all unexpected and that’s why I loved it. I get why people complain about characters not having enough build up time to end up where they did in the series finale, or it was just simply not earned. BUT if you think about it, it all makes sense, and story arcs fit perfectly well within the plot. I cannot overlook the fact that, yes, It feels a smidge rushed, but I still don’t get why people say that it was all ruined, but they seem to care less about the exact same issue in other movies, for example:

&amp;#x200B;

*Avengers: Endgame has character development issues:* To be honest, I was fairly satisfied with the outcome of **some** main characters. I say **some** because Thor used to be on of my favorite superheroes until Endgame happened. I personally didn't like the fact how Thor coped with his post traumatic depression of not being able to kill Thanos in the prior movie. We are talking about a damn powerful demigod able to take a damn star through the chest here, not that drunk childlike gamer weiner we got in the final installment. But there is so much we can do about writing decisions, right Dany..? Same as Thor, why don’t we all agree to understand why Daenerys decided to wipe an entire city to ashes because she was not able to handle rejection from the people of Westeros and her lover?  She literally lost everything, even the right to rule Westeros. After all, it makes sense to think it was a post traumatic depression after watching her best friend being decapitated in her freaking face. I mean I would snap the hell out of everyone too, well I probably wouldn’t have cooked innocents, but then again, wasn’t there a line about Targeryens’s birth? How the Gods would flip a coin every time a Targeryen is born? What about you mr. Night King? Can we all just get over the fact that the Night King didn’t give a proper fight to anyone? I mean, watching him smile after Drogon roasted the hell out of him it's just badass enough. Anyways, we are talking about freaking aliens coming down to earth and the world being saved by superheroes, dragons burning cities and children killing freaking ice zombie leaders. I mean what are the odds of that happening to Earth in real life right? phew.. good thing we’re talking about movies here. But man, what a great show/movie they are.

&amp;#x200B;

*Star Wars has character development issues:* How much time did Finn needed to become the good guy in TFA ? I mean, he was a trained soldier right? he was a first order stormtrooper, trained to follow orders for evil as they may seem, because he was serving as a soldier for the first order. But well he became his prisoner’s bff after (...) minutes of runtime. Reason? I just remember him saying “Because it is the right thing to do”... Jeez is that a good enough for betraying your side and become some rebel’s bff and escape who knows where and consequently becoming one of the first order’s target? Like I said earlier, If I have to go out of my way to read from a book or a comic something the movie wasn’t capable enough to explain in a logical way, It is because there is a writing problem right there. Finn might have his reasons for doing so and being so abrupt in his decision on defecting the first order, and I understand it and I don’t mind it as well as I don’t mind Rey non existent development on being a super Jedi or Dany’s sudden turn to madness. At least that did have some foreshadowing in prior seasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The pros of acknowledging the flaws** 

&amp;#x200B;

1- **It’s a fantasy show, which is why it’s not 100% realistic.** Game of Thrones achieved many things throughout the years, including being one of the most influential tv shows of history for the sole reason that *we* loved it from the beginning. The first episode got us all hooked and the more we watched the more we got invested in the vast world of Westeros, its plot, its drama, its cleverness, its characters, its unique way to develop the story in a way that we end up rooting even for the villains. And as realistic as it may seem, it is easy to forget that we are watching a fantasy show, and that is saying something about its quality. If that is the case, I don’t think it makes any sense to demand realism from a fantasy show. Why don’t we just embrace the top nodge quality of this show’s storytelling, stunning production and a big budget special effects. I honestly haven’t seen anything like it since LOTR or Blade Runner.

&amp;#x200B;

2- **Game of Thrones ties loose ends perfectly.** To be honest, I haven’t been a fan of tv show in general for two main reasons. 1) They lose track of the premise if the show is gaining popularity and 2) There is always a risk of the show getting cancelled for no reason at all. Game of Thrones promised to end in six seasons apparently. Somehow we ended up having eight seasons, and let me tell you something, I have never seen in my life how a show carefully tied loose ends in the season finale. I cried when after following Theon’s story arc we hear bran sayin “Theon, you are a good man. Thank you.” How is that not a satisfying ending? Jeez man, that always gets me. Or watching Jorah Mormont dying in the arms of the one he loved, the one he believed in. Even after being exiled from her twice. The way Melissandre fulfilled her destiny protecting the living against the dead. The prophecy we learned from her when he promised Arya to meet again in season 2. And Jamie, jeez what an epic ending. Tragic but epic. He always loved Cersei, even Olena Tyrell told him that, before he poisoned her when his army took Highgarden. She clearly stated that Cersei will be the end of him, and that’s what we got in the end. But even so, his redemptive story was finished by Brianne in The White Book with the words “He died protecting his queen”. He betrayed his oath by killing the mad king, but he finally fulfilledd his oath by protecting his queen, which also happens to be the woman he really loved. Man, and Brianne story arc? jeez, why do people even complain!? seriously!  And these are just some side characters. Plus the prophecy of Azor Ahai that everyone is raving about, it did come true in the end. Not as we all thought it was going to play out, but they did wrap that up beautifully and there is a Reddit post explaining it all in detail. Plus Jon’s destiny was to continue his days beyond the wall and Bran knew this, which is why he sent him off to the nonexistent “Night’s Watch” with the sole purpose to let him live his well earned days of peace beyond the wall. Arya sailing down to the unknown? She was never meant to be anything else, she was never “a lady” sort of girl. She also played her part by ending the Long Night and she was trained to do so. And Sansa? She became Queen in the North because she was fit to rule, and she demonstrated it by leading Winterfell to victory in the Battle of the Bastards and protecting it while Jon was away and even protected it from Jon himself and his hasty decisions. In the end guys, the way showrunners tied everything up is just epic and perfect. That is how you do a “bittersweet” ending.

&amp;#x200B;

3- **The freedom for characters to make their own choices.** We scream at them when they get to make bad choices, we solve their problems in our side of the tv, mumbling “don’t, just don’t” from our couches while we tensely watch them getting closer and closer to either their salvation or their doom. We loved to see the realism in their interaction with other characters or how they overcome misfortunes or even their own selves. Their outcomes made them more appealing and even relatable. But as realistic as it may seem, let us not forget that they are what they chose to be, they chose to make mistakes too, same as we all do, they make bad or even dumb decisions that frustrates us because we are the ones who can see everything in a broader scope, with the exception of themselves of course. Yet another reason to find this show amazingly realistic and enjoyable.

&amp;#x200B;

4- **Top quality production.** It will be just stupid to deny all the hard work that was put into this show throughout the years. And we can tell that the quality of production that improved so much in the season finale. We got to see special effects and production work that we can only see in a Hollywood budget. And even then, there is some real crap movies going around. In any case, if you have the opportunity to watch the documentary “The Last Watch” that explains the massive production that this show while filming season 8, you should definitely want to do so. Special effects and CGI were just stunning and not to mention that they actually ***built an entire city*** to film episode 5. They knew the balance between green screen and realistic filming, and that is something I appreciate greatly. After watching the documentary it would be just disrespectful to complain about anything. The direction was appealing and interesting. Battle sequences were stunning and exciting, I was genuinely in the edge of my seat in all of them. I could easily watch just season 8 over and over again.

&amp;#x200B;

5- **Thoroughly appreciate music production.** I am a musician myself, and I know and I understand how music work, and let me tell you, Ramin Djawadi did a surreal work with the show’s music. He carefully crafted a theme for each character. That is something just a handful of artists can do. I can just think of names like John Williams, Hans Zimmer, Howard Shore when I hear Ramin Djawadi’s name. The music was appealing, tense, epic and everything else exactly when it needed to be. I do not have words to describe this season’s soundtrack, other that it will definitely be that unreachable work of art and a source of admiration and inspiration for all my future projects.

&amp;#x200B;

And one more BIG side pro for me, is that this show ***never*** meant to reflect today’s trending in their show. And even if people force themselves to see it, I never did, because it never felt that way. Because man, all studios seem to be required to add some stupid useless trending as part of the movie and make it so damn obvious. If I want to see that, I would just watch the news channel. It has always bothered me and it just sucks that all the big studios are falling in doing the same, specially Disney. And that hurts to say, because they compromise an entire franchise, just to add unnecessary scenes with that content. I am sorry for Star Wars and Marvel fans and other movies that have gone through the same at some point. Which is why I love to immerse myself in a land so different and distant, yet relatable, that is Westeros.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I have read what people say about it and YES! I have read about certain main actors of the show ""disappointed"" with the outcome of the show. I would not even be doing this if I hadn’t. My point in doing this, in comparing movies that you probably haven’t even watched or you don’t like, is to prove that movies in general have flaws. All of them (even the best scored in rotten tomatoes). There are no perfect movies and that's why I think it makes no sense to complain. I hate how fans have become so obnoxiously demanding with creators, just because they don’t agree with their version of a story. And yes, I do not completely agree with some things, like Bran crowned King, or how Jon's lineage became irrelevant all of a sudden, but then again, ***they’re only movies***. And this is why I still love this show and the ending of what it probably is one of the best shows of television history. And that's more than enough for me to proudly add the collectors edition to my shelf alongside the Star Wars saga, The Infinity saga and LOTR trilogy.  It's just a matter of perspective and how you find a way to enjoy yourself with it and this is why I still vouch for this show. And this is why I think that ***Game of Thrones season finale DID NOT suck balls.***",asoiaf

505,"I see a lot of people were complaining that Jon was sent to the wall to placate the Unsullied who were leaving Westeros anyway. Yes, he could just come back as soon as they left, but that would lead to issues. The whole point of the ending is that they are going to pick their kings. Jon, as the last living Targaryen, is a direct threat to that. Even if he didn't want it, any child he had would be known as the grandson of Rhaegar Targaryen. That's why he must own no lands, father no children, etc.

The show didn't really address that, but I'm sure it's going to be a point in the books. He's meant to parallel Aemon Targaryen, who gave up his chance at the throne so he wouldn't be a threat to his brother.",asoiaf

507,"I’ve been thinking about this, and this is the most intelligent GOT reddit community so I thought I’d ask y’all. 

I sort of have two conflicting thoughts on the PTWP prophecy and want to see what this sub thinks about it.


A- Melisandre and the red priestesses have shown to frequently be an inaccurate source of information, and fans were foolish to blindly believe a prophecy coming from them. 

Melisandre, of course, thought stannis was the prince that was promised. She was wrong. She thought sacrificing shireen would win stannis the war. She was wrong, he was killed the next day. The red priestess in essos thought dany was the prophesied savior, which clearly is wrong. Melisandre is always talking about the prince that was promised. Is she wrong there also? Is it possible that fans way overestimated a prophecy coming from people proven to be an unreliable source of information? It has been talked about in the books and show by some characters about how you shouldn’t always trust prophecies.


Or


B- (I think I subscribe more to this theory)

Jon is the PTWP. Only the darkness was not the white walkers, as suspected, but actually Daenarys. He prevented her from “liberating” the entire world. She was the darkness that had to be stopped.  Of course, this isn’t what Melisandre thought (as evidenced by her thinking her purpose was fulfilled at the end of 8x03). But Melisandre hasn’t been shown as that reliable a source of info. Maybe she and the other red priestesses have a level of truth in what they are saying (prophecies such as the brown/green/blue eyes as well as Maggie the frog with Cersei, turned out true, so there’s some degree of truth in them apparently). Maybe while she knew the PTWP was real (and even thought it was Jon Snow after stannis died), she didn’t have a full understanding of it. She was able to resurrect Jon Snow, which supports this theory, if Jon was indeed the savior. Beric dondarrian was resurrected several times, and served a purpose as well. We saw him sacrifice himself for Arya. But if you think about it- if not for beric’s sacrifice, Jon Snow would have been certainly killed. If beric hadn’t saved Arya, the undead dragon would have definitely killed Jon. In the episode, moments before Arya kills NK, Jon was in a showdown with the undead dragon and the dragon was moments away from killing Jon. I think Beric’s resurrection was just as much about saving Jon as it was saving Arya. Since him saving Arya was critical for Jon snow’s survival as well.

Also- (I haven’t read the books so this is from Wikipedia)

“The phrase “The prince that was promised” is first mentioned in the second novel, “A clash of kings”: during one of her visions in the house of the undying, Daenarys sees a man and woman- presumed to be her brother rhaeagar and his wife Elia Martell- speaking about a newborn baby that the woman is nursing. The man says that the baby shall be called “Aegon” and that he is “the prince that was promised.”

So that seemingly also supports the idea that Jon is the PTWP.

What do you all think?",asoiaf
508,"So it’s been a few weeks since the show ended. Most posts on here have been about how much we hated the ending but what parts of the show’s ending do you think will be largely copied in the books.

1. Dany burning Kings Landing and becoming a villain. It seems most people accept that this will happen in some fashion in the books as well but we are assuming it will be done much better.

2. Bran being King at the end. Based largely on the Bran’s actor admitting this was GRRM’s plan for Bran we will assume it will also happen in the books but be done much better.

3. Jon killing Dany. This seems more debatable but it makes sense based on what we know of both of them that this will happen in the books. Definitely up for debate.

4. How does the White Walker plot end? This is the main one I haven’t seen talked about. We don’t even know if there is a Night King in the books. We definitely don’t know if killing him will end the White Walker threat. Since D&amp;D seemed to randomly pick Arya to be the hero we don’t really know who will lead the Army of the Living to victory or how it will happen. Did the show change the WW ending or is that how GRRM is also going to end it?

5. Arya the Explorer, Jon the Wilding, Queen of the North, Northern Independence, Unsullied going to Naath, etc. more minor endings but any thoughts on these would be interesting as well.",asoiaf
509,"Everybody knows Qarth has no chapter in TWOIAF and that Elio and Linda said [in interview](http://www.adriasnews.com/2015/09/elio-linda-interview.html) ""*George would not give us anything about Qarth*"" and somehow compared its level of secrecy to the Summerhall events.

Slaver's Bay was also left out of TWOIAF. However it happened because nobody (even Yandell) cared about Slaver's Bay. In Qarth's case, Yandell makes reference to an in-universe book, the *Jade Compendium,* what's really telling.

We had threads like this before, but I'm here to share my impressions and findings.

**1.** **What might be hidden in Qarth?**

The importance of Summerhall and Meereen are easily perceived. The tragedy of Sumerhall will be Dunk and Egg's final chapter and is a secret in itself. In turn, we have seen that what divides Daenerys' followers and Quenn's false friends in Meereen are historical reasons. So it is reasonable that Martin prefers to leave the historical backstage for TWOW and surprise readers, rather than to put three extra pages in TWOIAF.

Qarth's history, on the other hand, has different implications. Since the city was never part of the Valyrian Freehold, it is quite possible that these two civilizations have already warred. In fact, in ACOK one of Daenerys' bloodriders finds something very relevant south of Vaes Tolorro:

&gt;*Rakharo was the first to return. Due south the red waste stretched on and on, he reported, until it ended on a bleak shore beside the poison water. Between here and there lay only swirling sand, wind-scoured rocks, and plants bristly with sharp thorns.* ***He had passed the bones of a dragon, he swore, so immense that he had ridden his horse through its great black jaws***\*\*\*.\*\*\* *Other than that, he had seen nothing.* ***(ACOK, Daenerys I)***

This striking description resembles that of other formidable animals, well known to readers:

&gt;*The singers had given them the names of gods: Balerion, Meraxes, Vhaghar. Tyrion had stood between their gaping jaws, wordless and awed.* ***You could have ridden a horse down Vhaghar's gullet***\*, although you would not have ridden it out again.\* ***Meraxes was even bigger***\*. And the greatest of them,\* ***Balerion, the Black Dread, could have swallowed an aurochs whole, or even one of the hairy mammoths*** *said to roam the cold wastes beyond the Port of Ibben.* ***(AGOT, Tyrion I)***

Therefore, the bones discovered in the Red Waste show us that the dragon that died there was comparable to the larger Targaryen's dragons. In the light of Martin's refusal to elaborate further on Qarth's history, this discovery becomes more striking, for it seems to indicate that in the past the qaathi (people from whom qartheens are the last living descendants) were able to defeat such dragons.

Another item that connects Valyrians and Quartheens is the horn Dragonbinder. Euron claims to have found the artifact as he walked over Valyria. However, many doubt this claim, and believe Euron stole the horn from the Warlocks he has captured. This hunch is supported by a semi-canonical source (the app, on ""Qarth"" entry).

However, one might wonder how did qartheen warlocks acquire a valyrian dragon horn, which supposedly has the power to subdue and ""bind"" dragons to the will of whoever blows it.

It's hard to picture valyrians giving Qarth artifacts capable of taming dragons, under any pretext soever (eg, wedding gift, offering to Undying Ones or reward for services). Hence, it would have been simpler if someone in Qarth had stolen the horn. And not necessarily from a living person.

While reflecting on Drogon's training, Daenerys recalled that ""*the dragonlords of old Valyria had controlled their mounts with binding spells and sorcerous horns*"" (ADWD, Daenerys X). In that sense, the dragon bones in the Red Waste could be a clue as to how the Warlocks got it. Looting a dragonrider's corpse that Qarth managed to defeat would explain the origin of the horn.

The sorcerous artifact could even explain why Valyria never expanded their hold towards Qarth. With the horn, the warlocks could neutralize dragons. Red Waste and triple walls provided protection against land attacks, while Dragonbinder would protect Qarth from dragon fire.

Lastly: George might still be concerned about sharing information about Qarth because he would have to reveal the secrets of the House of the Undying and it's warlocks, of the Shades of Evening they consume, and of the Black Bark Trees from which the beverage is extracted.

**2. Really?**

No. All these speculations are very coherent, but we can't say any of this for sure.

Indeed, Qarth is not the only place in the known world that has secret organizations with magical profile. TWOIAF has an entire chapter devoted to Braavos without spoiling any secret of the Faceless Men. Another chapter was dedicated to Asshai (where there are also qarthenos wizards in activity) and the city remains as mysterious and unfathomable as ever. King's Landing widely cited and explored, but we gained no new knowledge regarding the Alchemists' Guild.

As for Dragonbinder, even though the aforementioned hypothesis was able to bring together the few elements we have in a coherent way, there is no justification for closing ourselves to other possibilities. Or would it be utterly impossible for Martin to claim that, in the past, a mountless dragon lord fell in disgrace, traveled to Qarth, and sold his precious horn to remake his fortune? That's also a plausible explanation for how it got there.

Nor can it be argued that no valyrian would ever give up the horn because it would allow Qarth to challenge the Freehold, for, see, regardless of how they got it, the Warlocks already have a horn. If this would put them in position to compete with the Freehold, the challenge would have already taken place. And if that would have had already happened, Qarth would have its own dragons. Since none of this happened, we must conclude that the Dragonbinder alone had not enough power to shake Valyria.

On the other hand, the dragon carcass in the middle of the Red Waste hardly prove anything except that it was the site of the last rest of the beast. To think that the creature was ridden by a dragon knight is mere speculation.

Dragon bones have been found from Ibben to Sothoryos. Yandel believes this is evidence that these creatures, though first originated from the Fourteen Flames, ""*must have been spread across much of the known world before they were tamed*"" (TWOIAF, Ancient History: The Rise of Valyria), while others believe that dragons appeared in the ""*Shadow Lands beyond Asshai and the islands of the Jade Sea*"" (AGOT, Daenerys III).

Therefore, the bones in the red desert may be just the remains of a ancient wild dragon.

**3. So what do we really have?**

What we really have on Qarth is the *Jade Compendium,* written by Coloquo Vottar, a volantene.

Votar's work was first mentioned in AFFC and then again in ADWD and TWOIAF. However, the book is not limited to being quoted. He actually appears on the Wall. Sam seeks for a copy in the underground libraries of Castle Black, in order to deliver it to Mae

ster Aemon, who, after examining it with help from Clydas, hands him over to Lord Commander Jon Snow.

What is interesting to note is that the passage in which Aemon and Jon briefly discuss the *Jade Compendium* appears in both AFFC, Samwell I, and ADWD, Jon II. [As some users noted here this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/c2l7tk/spoilers_extended_discarded_how_grrm_rewrote_an/erkw1cp/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), Martin originally only wrote this chapter in Samwell's POV, but some time after 2005 he decided to add Jon's. So it seems Martin thought this conversation needed to be highlighted.

In introducing the Compendium to Jon Snow, Aemon's intention was for the Lord Commander to realize that Stannis's sword did not resemble Azor Ahai's Lightbringer. Jon gets to read the book, but only the few pages indicated by the old maester. This is how Lord Commander summarizes the passage he read:

&gt;*\[...\] ""I looked at that book Maester Aemon left me. The Jade Compendium. The pages that told of Azor Ahai. Lightbringer was his sword. Tempered with his wife's blood if Votar can be believed. Thereafter Lightbringer was never cold to the touch, but warm as Nissa Nissa had been warm. In battle the blade burned fiery hot.* ***Once Azor Ahai fought a monster. When he thrust the sword through the belly of the beast, its blood began to boil. Smoke and steam poured from its mouth, its eyes melted and dribbled down its cheeks, and its body burst into flame.****""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Clydas blinked. ""A sword that makes its own heat …""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*""… would be a fine thing on the Wall."" Jon put aside his wine cup and drew on his black moleskin gloves. ""A pity that the sword that Stannis wields is cold. \[...\]* **(ADWD, Jon III)**

The bold part adds new facts to the version of the legend of Azor Ahai that was told to us in ACOK by Sallador Saan. Thus, it seems that the Compendium has a **more complete** version of the myth. And this version would have been the result of the voyages of a foreigner, Colloquo Votar, by ""*all the lands of the Jade Sea*"" (AFFC, Samwell I; ADWD, Jon II). And among those lands are Yi Ti, Leng and Qarth.

Coincidentally, this is the book whose account of Qarth is, in the opinion of Maester Yandel, **the best source** of information that Westeros has about the city and its surroundings (TWOIAF, Beyond the Sunset Kingdom: Other Lands/ TWOIAF, The Bones and Beyond: Yi Ti). The book is **probably also the most complete source**. Otherwise Yandel would not limit himself to tell the reader to consult the *Compendium*.

Obviously, Yandel's statement was the form found by George Martin to tell us that we will only have access to the Compendium (and information about Qarth) through what the characters tell us. However, in putting things like this, Martin also reveals that the Compendium must contain relevant unpublished information.

**4. But what information has the** ***Jade Compendium*** **given us so far?**

Samwell Tarly refers to the book as ""a thick volume of tales and legends from the East"" (AFFC, Samwell I), and really tales and legends is all we know to be in it. Here is the list of what we have heard:

1. The most complete version we have ever heard of the legend of Azor Ahai and Lightbringer, as seem above (ADWD, Jon III);
2. a curious legend of Yi Ti about a woman with a monkey tail who managed to bring back the sun, after he had hidden his face from the earth for a lifetime, ashamed of something that no one has ever discovered what was (TWOIAF, Ancient History: The Long Night);
3. The best report on Qarth, in Maester Yandel's opinion (TWOIAF, Beyond the Sunset Kingdom: Other Lands);
4. The statement that, beneath every YiTish city, three older cities lie buried (TWOIAF, The Bones and Beyond: Yi Ti);
5. the report that the Empress of Leng, at least four times in the history of the island, put all strangers on the island to death, on orders received from the ""Old Ones"", gods who lived deep below the ruined subterranean cities (TWOIAF, The Bones and Beyond: Leng);

We can observe that, apart from what we have dealt with throughout this post, we only have three new information and they are all about Yi Ti and Leng -- in other words, regions that are of no interest to the main plot.

In addition, of the three information, only one makes an indirect reference to something of interest in the main plot: a legend about Yi Ti's experience during the Long Night, in which a monkey-tail heroine saved the world from catastrophe.

**5. Ok, and?**

And it turns out that this particular legend seems to reverberate in the culture of Yi Ti to this day, just as the legend of Azor Ahai seems to be embedded in the customs of Qarth.

It's not for nothing that the book by which the westerosis have the most complete source of information about Qarth is that which also contains the most complete version of the Azor Ahai's legend.

I explain: Some time ago, [absolutely detail-oriented readers suggested](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/80407-lightbringer-theory-spoilers-if-you-havent-finished-all-the-books/&amp;tab=comments#comment-4072625) that the [qartheens female gowns](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Qartheen_gown), which leave one exposed breast, would be a reference to Nissa Nissa, to whom, according to legend, Azor Ahai would have ordered to ""*bare your breast, and know that I love you best of all that is in this world*"" (ACOK, Davos I) before tempering Lightbringer in her heart.

This already sounded to me like something that fits well with Martin's world-style creation. When, in the light of that, I read about the monkey-tailed heroine, I immediately recalled what Daenerys had observed in the eastern market of Vaes Dothraki:

&gt;""*the bright-eyed men of Yi Ti in monkey-tail hats*"" (AGOT, Daenerys VI)  
&gt;  
&gt;""*a fat cloth trader from Yi Ti was haggling with a Pentoshi over the price of some green dye, the monkey tail on his hat swaying back and forth as he shook his head*"" (AGOT, Daenerys VI)

Therefore, I feel compelled to infer that the influence that the myths of the Long Night exerted on the fashion of Yi Ti and Qarth was created to serve as an example, for comparison.

This case was made to serve as a parameter and enable the reader to decipher the correlations between the events described in the *Jade Compendium* and elements of everyday life of the characters, hidden under the facade of tales and legends of strange, bizarre lands.

That is why I believe that Martin's silence about Qarth serves as an invitation to reflect on the encrypted evidence at our disposal. And, as you can see from the list above, there are at least two more tales from Colloquo Votar's book whose importance remain unknown.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, would anybody be so kind to help me decipher the rest? Thanks in advance.**

EDIT:**TL;DR** \- The *Jade Compendium* has encrypted crossed-information about Qarth (and possibly Azor Ahai and Lightbringer) in the shape of tales and legends from Leng and Yi Ti.",asoiaf

Throughout ADWD and his time as Lord Commander Jon deliberated decisions carefully for the most part, and we read his internal struggle when making decisions. That and all his discussions about duty to the Night’s Watch and taking no part in conflicts within the realm.

This time we read no internal struggle, and maybe that’s because GRRM wanted to wrap up the book as quickly as possible at that point, or he’s planning to save that for the next book or whenever Jon gets resurrected. But I’ve also read that because Jon will have spent time in Ghost, he will return more wolf-like, including becoming more bloodthirsty, will want to seek vengeance, and perhaps becomes more rash in his decision-making. Then maybe it’s justified and George will skip the decision-making part. But Jon’s decision to go to Winterfell felt rushed and out of character at this point in the book.

522,"Hi all,

I'm trying to understand how addiction (and specifically alcoholism) is tackled in ASOIAF.

Notable alcoholics include Cersei and Tyrion. Both of them seem to be portrayed as (mostly) high functioning alcoholics (in show for sure, and in books too mostly). Tyrion has some episodes where he goes too far but other than that he's still able to function.

Does the ASOIAF content tackle alcoholism showing its more destructive side? What are some examples of this?

Thank you for any replies.

# The High of Righteous Indignation

**Note**: this turned out longer than expected. TL;DR at the bottom.

Since the end of *Game of Thrones,* I've seen many people complaining about the way Daenerys' ""supposed"" madness comes out of left field. It's been disheartening, these last few years to see such vitriol over fictional characters, and I think you can see many parallels between the toxicity which bubbled to the surface after *The Last Jedi* released and the petition movements and at times hour(s)-long Youtube videos spewing self-entitled petulance because they don't agree with how fictional intellectual property was handled.

Many people have responded to Daenerys' ending in the same way Star Wars fans did to Luke Skywalker's characterization in *The Last Jedi*. But the problem is that, in both cases, however valid people's initial frustration, people are getting almost *addicted* to a sense righteous indignation and reveling in a collective petulance (to think it was once a meme to assume some sort of superiority over those ""uncultured swine"" who get into sports), that some develop an unhealthy obsession. ""Not my Daenerys!"" they cry, as they go into detail about why this or that ""isn't what Daenerys would do."" They've had years to build up these theories and headcanons, that some will never be satisfied. Even content creators among the *ASOIAF* community have done this. I used to really enjoy **Ideas of Ice and Fire**'s Youtube videos and theories, but now he mostly just complains about dumb shit the show did, conflating the watered-down D&amp;D version with Martin's book material. **And** ***this*** **is an issue**.

# The Difference Between D&amp;D and Peter Jackson/Philippa Boyens/Fran Walsh

But I think they are at least half, if not mostly right, when it comes to this whole ""crucifying child-murdering slavers as foreshadowing the moment Daenerys burns a city of innocent civilians. I agree because clearly D&amp;D take the shortest path wherever possible, and from the beginning they've only ever sought to adapt *spectacle*, rather than adapt *substance*. As many like to [cite](http://grantland.com/features/the-return-hbo-game-thrones/):

&gt;*Themes are for eighth-grade book reports.*

D&amp;D seem to have looked at the exhaustive work Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens, and Fran Walsh put into adapting Tolkien's *The Lord of the Rings*, and thought ""easy."" Some things PJ/PB/FW did in order to adapt *LOTR* were **inspired** (their ability to condense characters without sacrificing characterization/theme, their intimate knowledge of the lore, their respect for the substance without being impractically dogmatic, their respect for the discerning fans and attention to details that reward closer inspection, etc), and it seems D&amp;D thought it must be that easy. But if D&amp;D set out thinking they were PJ/PB/FW adapting *The Lord of the Rings*, they wound up closer to Warner Bros adapting *The Hobbit* (I recommend checking out [Lindsay Ellis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTRUQ-RKfUs)' Youtube analysis on that process). And so, ***spectacle***, rather than ***substance***.

It's purely speculation, but the final product seems to imply D&amp;D heard ""...and then Daenerys burns Kings Landing,"" and jumped on it because it ""would subvert expectations."" But the end result lacks any *substance.* No dietary value, no commentary on the nature of power, heroes, messiahs, etc You know, themes Sure, we get a misguided monologue that equates apathy to the violent death of an abusive brother who threatened a child (his own sister) with gang-rape and mutilation, leading inevitably to tyranny and war crimes, but that seems like low-hanging fruit. In the end, it's more about the spectacle than any meditation on the substance, and whatever themes or commentary GRRM may be working toward are lost in the noise.

# Frank Herbert and George RR Martin - Beware False Idols

Finally, I mentioned Ideas of Ice and Fire earlier, and the problems of a fan assuming an unhealthy ownership of material. In one of his recent videos, [he goes on a rant about how Daenerys would never do this or that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d6L3lg7ZRU), and how her ending fails the character. I encourage you to watch it, as it captures the point where I think people plateau on the matter of Daenerys not merely as a character, but as a *discourse*.

It's *not* to imply that it's a slippery slope from torturing child-murdering slavers or burning enemies alive, to murdering thousands of civilians. **It's** ***not*** **that women in power can't be trusted**, even though the audience isn't expected to bat an eye when her male counterparts do the same thing. **That** ***this*** **is largely the takeaway says more about David Benioff and D. B. Weiss than it does GRRM**. D&amp;D needed her to get from A to B, and an excuse simple enough to fit into a 5-8 minute after-the-episode short to explain her irrational behavior and inconsistent decisions to get her there. The ""Mad Queen"" characterization was just low-hanging fruit.

Instead, I'd put my money on **Daenerys being meant to follow in the tradition of Frank Herbert's** ***Dune***, with Daenerys fulfilling the role of Paul Atreides, or Adrien ""Ozymandias"" Veidt from Alan Moore's\*\* ***Watchmen***. A *huge*theme of *Dune*, and something Herbert spoke often about, was a distrust for charismatic leaders and messiah-types as a matter of principle, because it is inherently dangerous to blindly follow *anyone,* regardless their trappings. That includes the beautiful/kind/generous-types, not just the ugly/mean/creepy ones. It's not a warning against some sort of ""tyranny of women,"" seriously people? it's a warning against the tyranny **of surrendering autonomy to a charismatic leader**. I began this post with a quote. Asked about the origins of *Dune*, Frank Herbert [responded](https://www.oreilly.com/tim/herbert/ch01.html):

&gt;*I had this theory that superheroes were disastrous for humans, that even if you postulated an infallible hero, the things this hero set in motion fell eventually into the hands of fallible mortals. What better way to destroy a civilization, society or a race than to set people into the wild oscillations which follow their turning over their judgment and decision-making faculties to a superhero?*

We're meant to decide *for ourselves* those qualities we hope to emulate in a character like Daenerys or Paul, but not surrender our autonomy to those leaders who dominate our waking lives under the assumption they're *anything* like the messiahs and charismatic leaders of the stories we've been conditioned to respond positively to. Someone like Ideas of Ice and Fire is right to cite all the generosity and benevolence demonstrated by Daenerys on her journey, but I personally believe it's a mistake to assume that means she's incapable of incredible cruelty; more dangerously, that she's incapable of justifying the *necessity of that cruelty*. Martin says, via Stannis in *A Clash of Kings*:

&gt;*A good act does not wash out the bad,* ***nor a bad act the good***. *Each should have its own reward.*

Or perhaps, a more appropriate quote would be this line from Syrio in *A Game of Thrones*:

&gt;*Just so. Opening your eyes is all that is needing.* ***The heart lies and the head plays tricks with us, but the eyes see true. Look with your eyes. Hear with your ears***. Taste with your mouth. Smell with your nose. Feel with your skin. ***Then comes the thinking, afterward, and in that way knowing the truth***.

**TL;DR**: **NOTHING I've said is gospel, just my takeaway, one I haven't really seen voiced**. We can agree D&amp;D, appreciating spectacle over substance took too many shortcuts to get Daenerys (or everyone, for that matter) from point A to B. But so many people seem to think it's a *betrayal* of her character without even having read the finished story Martin is building toward. Worse, many seem so caught up in riding the high of righteous indignation and collective outrage, that they'd rather complain about this or that than look at what Martin might be trying to say, as opposed to what people want to see after years of expectation, theory-crafting, and headcanon; this last point illustrates an **unhealthy sense of ownership of a piece of fictional intellectual property that exists outside their control, but to which they seem to** ***think themselves entitled***. But maybe, *just maybe*, if one stops fixating on the interpretation of lesser storytellers and allows themselves to be receptive to what it means that the story goes there at all, we stop with all this tired vitriol and get on with more worthy subjects, beginning with Daenerys.

526,"Of course this is not going to happen, so bear with me, as it's just a thought I had.

Books are very much different than a TV series as a medium, and one of the biggest differences is that the chapters need to be released all at once, and there isn't really much around that. This is probably a good thing for most people, but I really miss all of the hype surrounding cliffhangers and the downtime between each episode where people are viciously discussing online and posting their theories.

So imagine that the next books would be released little by little, say, one or two chapters a week, online or through some other manner. Do you think you would get more or less enjoyment from it, overall?",asoiaf
527,"So I started my second read of the books and I got to the point in A Game of Thrones where Ned had the realization about Cersei and Jaime. He confronts Cersei about it stating that he's read the book on the history of the major families of westeros. He had the realization that 'the seed is Strong' is the Baratheon genes. That no matter what, the child of a baratheon would have black hair. Ned also noted in the book that he found two accounts of baratheon-lannister marriages. One of the marriages being a male from the Lannister and a female from the Baratheons and the child being a Lannister name having black hair. Wouldn't there then be a possible branch in the Lannister lineage that they have black hair since the black dominates the blonde? Just something to think about",asoiaf
528,"Hello you guys
I'm looking for advice with making an list with an order of characters I should follow to make the most out of reading AFFC

I've watched the tv show and just finished ASOS in the normal way of reading, but im really interested in starting my first ever AFFC reading going through all the chapters of a pov before moving to the next
I've searched the sub for older posts on the subject, but i only found people asking for opinions on the idea and people being very passionate about the orthodox order, but im not asking if i *should*. I know it might confuse, i know some pov characters appear in others, i know the series has that order for a reason and all. I care for spoilers but not that much

It would be kind of you to be vague enough so to avoid spoilers, but explain the reasoning

For exemple, my friend told me the jaime arc is more complex in AFFC than cersei's and much of what might puzzle me in hers can be answered in jaime's, so he advised me to put cersei anywhere before jamie

TL;DR: Gonna read AFFC for the fist time in the ""character by character"" way. Want help to make an optimal reaing order",asoiaf
529,"At first glance you have a gifted knight, one of the most gifted swordsmen in the realm, who trains against 3 and 4 foes at a time when practicing in the yard and is said to be far better than his brother Loras, who is no slouch either and a member of the Kingsguard to boot.

In addition to that he is very kind to Tyrion at Joffrey’s wedding, telling his wife: “No, my lady,” Ser Garlan said. “My Lord of Lannister was made to do great deeds, not to sing of them. But for his chain and his wildfire, the foe would have been across the river. And if Tyrion’s wildlings had not slain most of Lord Stannis’s scouts, we would never have been able to take him unawares.”

So basically he seems like an awesome dude. A total badass and a gentleman as well. 


But then after becoming obsessed with ASOIAF (me, not Garlan, if Garlan actually existed he would be doing something far more meaningful than composing a meaningless post on Reddit right now) come to find out that a lot of people think he may have been involved in the Tyrell/Littlefinger poisoning scheme and his compliments little more then lies meant to placate Tyrion and I guess help prevent Tyrion from becoming so salty that he leaves the wedding reception and they lose their patsy for the crime. Some have even been bold enough to suggest that Garlan was the one who poisoned Joffrey’s cup. Seeing all of that really annoyed me. I don’t buy it, Garlan wouldn’t do that as far as I’m concerned. I wouldn’t be best friends with a guy like that, and I would definitely be best friends with Garlan if he really existed, for a little bit anyway before he got accepted into a college I had no prayer at getting into and found cooler friends and slowly forgot I existed but still, you get the point.

Anyway, where do you guys stand on Garlan? Overall good guy or are you the purveyors of  tinfoil tuna that think he was up to no good at the purple wedding?

Sorry in advance for all of the nonsense in this post and any typos and shit.",asoiaf
530,"  Ok sorry if this has been talked about before and a second apology as this post is going to be very rambly.

The most disappointing thing about GoT season 8 for me was the others/white walkers. The fact that they were just “the cold big bad” infuriates me, as so many loose ends were left so. 

This got me thinking about what we know about the others/white walkers and a couple of the anomalies that have stuck in my mind regarding the “battle for the dawn”. The two main ones being the Wall and the Nights King.

So the wall is big, and built out of a really difficult material to produce, especially in ancient times without refrigeration. I know it was supposedly built with magic and giants but even still, a giant wall of ice sounds like it is more likely to have been built by the ice demons than by humans, like why build a wall of ice to stop ice demons? Another anomaly with the wall is that even though giants and children of the forest (cotf) helped build it to protect themselves against the others, there only surviving populations live beyond the wall they built to protect themselves.

Also, the nights king is a pretty strong hint that the humans and others reached an agreement, along with the weird ancient nightfort and its weird ancient door. So, if the others and humans reached an agreement why build the wall?

The pact between the cotf and the first men in my mind was most likely in response to the others, enemies putting aside their differences against a larger threat. However, in the show the others/white walkers are created by the children, so if they are just ice minions of the cotf, why would they fight against their masters?

I think that the pact between the humans and the cotf was not a pact between the humans and cotf, but one between the humans and the others against the children and that the wall was built to defend against the cotf. Despite the children supposedly faring poorly in the war against the first men, they possessed massive supernatural magic, breaking the arm of dorne, and as mentioned, if the show is to be believed, creating the others from humans. Perhaps the others overcame there programming and recovered some of their humanity and helped the first men fight against the cotf. Like are we really meant to believe that the cotf weren’t well equipped for war given their insane magic abilities. The end of this war resulting in the wall being put up to defend against the cotf, the establishment of the Nights king with marriage to the others and the cotf fled to the far north.

This is complete speculation but given how long ago all this happened and how the only accounts of what happened are just stories passed down through generations for thousands of years the story of what happened is probably very different to what actually happened. 

I know this has some issues like cotf living on the isle of faces and that some people believe that cotf live in the neck, along with why do the first men continue to worship the religion of the cotf if they fought a war against them. But I think that these can sort of be botched to make sense. I doubt that all the cotf wanted to war against the first men, so made peace through marriage (the neck and crannogman) and exile(?) by living on the isle of faces. In regard to gods, the old gods were probably very real to those in ancient westeros with the cotf throwing magic all over the place, so perhaps the first men started worshipping them as well to earn their favour or something. 

Idk I think it would be a nice twist if the supposedly good, leafy, environmental elves turned out to be the vengeful dark evil rather than the obvious ice demons.

Also giants, why do the giants only live beyond the wall? I think that its highly possible that the cotf warged into them and used them as weapons, we’ve already seen Bran do this with the “giant” Hodor, and like Hodor, giants aren’t the smartest so were probably easyish to warg into. So when the cotf were pushed north so were the giants. 

One last thing I just thought of, in the first book a few wights, animated by the others, are able to pass through the wall and attack the lord commander, but coldhands, who is animated by the cotf, cant pass through the wall when he goes to meet bran. So if the cotf supposedly put magic into the wall when they built it to protect against the others, why can the others wights pass through it, but coldhands cant?

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: I think its possible that the pact was not between the children and first men but between the others and the first men against the children.**",asoiaf
531,"For AFFC it was the realization that he had to scrap the 5 year gap and start where ASOS left off. For ADWD it was the Mereneese Knot. How about TWOW? Supposedly GRRM was near finishing in 2015 before undergoing massive rewrites. Was that because he didn’t get as far as he wanted (to still end it in seven books), or did he find a major plot hole, or was he simply just unhappy with with the quality of writing? 

Either way, it seems like he scrapped a lot of what he had and is still (seemingly) having issues writing the book. If the Mereenese Knot took him so long to hack through, I can only imagine how many more “knots” he has to deal with in TWOW with all the POVs converging. 

I can’t wait for the day TWOW is finally out and he explains what took him so long like he did with ADWD.",asoiaf

Both his father and surviving uncle are balding. They say that the propensity to bald comes from your mother's side and what do you know? Jaime is an inbred son of a gun. 

Yeah, sure, Jaime's already shaved his head or whatever, but that was his own choice. Balding naturally is a totally different experience. Imagine Jaime just waking up one day with gold hair on his pillow and going ""Oh lions!"". It's comedic (Lannister) gold!

535,"GRRM has said that we will probably not visit Asshai in the main narrative of ASOIAF, except perhaps in POV flashbacks or through character recollections.

But was that always the case? In earlier versions of GRRM's plan, could a POV character have visited Asshai in the present time period as part of the main narrative? (Dany perhaps)

After reading The World of Ice and Fire, I wonder if some of that material (especially concerning the Further East beyond the Bone Mountains) was supposed to be revealed in ASOIAF itself, but there is no longer room for it in the story GRRM is trying to tell. So, as he narrows and tightens the narrative, earlier material might have been preserved and moved into The World of Ice and Fire.

For example:
Dany's visions/dreams in the published A Game of Thrones featured gold/silver haired figures with eye colours that correspond with the legendary Gemstone Emperors of the Great Empire of the Dawn. Implying that the history of that lost ancient civilization would have some bearing on the unfolding story still to come.
Four books later and perhaps that history is no longer as important to reaching the final endgame of the story.

Yadda yadda yadda, GRRM can't kill her and etc.

BUT

I'm trying to think like a FM here.

They have an inkling of her true origins, once she proves to be not FM material, they might have to shut her up to not spill any secrets.

That would come with a brand new face to use, maybe for the waif.

This would allow fmArya to infiltrate the upper eschelon of Westeros leadership at a pivotal moment, assuming the show is somewhat in line with what happens in the book.

Bravoosi do not like dragonlords, and we might end up with at least two in Westeros (Jon and Dany)

537,"&gt;A mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone.

Back in 2013, psychologists at The New School in New York City conducted an experiment to see how reading different types of literature affect the reader's ability to empathize with others. To clarify, empathy is the ability to identify and understand the thoughts or feelings of others, not to be confused with sympathy, which is caring about them. Their results were that [reading literary fiction greatly improved empathy](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/novel-finding-reading-literary-fiction-improves-empathy/), while genre fiction did not. Bold claims based on psychology experiments should be met with a huge dose of skepticism, but the mechanism theorized behind this effect makes a lot of sense -- and that mechanism shows how the Song of Ice and Fire series looks much more like literary fiction than genre fiction.

The theory behind the increased empathy is that in literary fiction you spend a lot of time in the head of characters, getting to experience their thoughts. This happens intermittently in third-person omniscient texts, but in first-person narratives you're in the character's head the entire time. Spending hours on end directly observing someone's thoughts, it's believed, increases our capacity for figuring out what other people are thinking and feeling. Even though the characters are fictional, the practice of reading these kinds of books at least gives the reader experience witnessing ideas and motivations different from their own.

I remember when the article first came out; I was in grad school getting an MFA in creative writing. Our Facebook group lit up with clickbait articles claiming ""reading literary fiction gives you the ability to read minds"" and talk about how *of course* literary fiction is superior to that low-brow genre stuff. I recall only one person in the program regularly writing genre fiction; the most popular genre was misery porn.

Yeah, well, as Sandor Clegane said, ""Keep talking and I'll chicken you next Tuesday."" Or something like that, I forget the exact line. Point being, the literary fiction divide is quite silly.

**ASOIAF as Literary Fantasy**

So what is ""literary"" fiction? Basically, it's a dumb name, that's what. It applies to everything that isn't ""genre"" fiction. So what's genre fiction? Think about how streaming services like Prime and Netflix organize their films. There's action, scifi, superhero, comedy, westerns, war films, etc. Everything that falls into the general ""drama"" category? That's literary fiction. For some reason, folks in graduate lit departments have started to think ""literary"" described the quality of the text. It doesn't.

Truth be told, a lot of genre fiction is rather bad. Probably the vast majority of it is bad. Timothy Zahn's *Heir to the Empire* is the reading equivalent of stubbing your toe every 5 minutes. *Thrawn* was a massive improvement, and Zahn succeeded in writing the world's greatest 450-page Wookiepeedia article. But to be fair, this stuff is hard. Getting a D+ puts you in the top 1% of writers. There's a reason you're reading my commentary and not my original works.

Also, truth be told, a lot of literary fiction is also rather bad. There's nothing about being not-genre that makes writing good.

So, where does this leave A Song of Ice and Fire? I'm going to call it Literary Fantasy. And, I don't mean that to say ""it's really well written fantasy."" It *is* really well written fantasy, but I mean something more specific. It's fiction that is doing *what literary fiction is supposed to do.*

Going back to the empathy study, what the researchers classified as literary fiction were stories which spent a lot of time in the head of the characters, giving the reader direct access to their thoughts and feelings. In that light, it's obvious how A Song of Ice and Fire is exceptionally literary.

I mentioned third person omniscient and first person points of view earlier, but ASOIAF is third person close, sometimes called third person limited. Think of this as the over-the-shoulder camera angle common in many video games. It's written with third person pronouns, but stays very intimately attached to a single character (or in the case of ASOIAF, close to one per chapter). This gives us an amount of interiority on par with first person narratives. It varies from character to character, with some being more introspective than others (AGOT Catelyn has much more internal thoughts than AGOT Sansa, for instance), but in general we're spending a lot of time inside the heads of the characters.

While most literary fiction lets us experience the thoughts and feelings of a single protagonist, ASOIAF goes a step further by giving multiple point of view characters. We spent time learning about the mechanics inside several different people's heads. This makes GRRM's novels arguably more literary than most literary fiction, though it does also take him 700 pages to get in all those different perspectives -- doing more *with more* is the expectation.

**Syd Field's Three Lives**

In his book *Screenplay*, Syd Field describes three different lives everyone lives. We have our public/professional lives, our personal lives, and our private lives. This is who we are to the world, who we are to our friends and family, and who we are to ourselves.

Not every novel necessarily needs to delve into each layer, and certainly not in equal amounts. For instance, in Stephen King's *The Body* (the short-ish story Stand By Me is based on) we get mostly Gordon LaChance's personal life with his friends and parents, and his private life, but there's always an undercurrent of the public life, dealing with characters who are only beginning to really have a public life, and how they deal when the public and private butt heads (especially with Chris Chambers's interactions with the school).

In ASOIAF, we often do get a near-even blend of the three. Characters hold war councils, they speak privately with their family and confidants, and they keep some thoughts to themselves. We regularly get all three layers in a single scene. Bran has some time with Rodrik and Lewin before receiving guests for the Harvest Feast. Tyrion travels with some guards to a brothel before sneaking off to Shae's manse. Theon is on a commercial ship before riding off with Aeron, and then meeting with his father privately. Someone meets with a big group, then meets with someone one-on-one, and all the while there we watch their interior gears turn.

While different stories will necessarily require a different blend of these three lives (hard for four kids in the woods to have much of a public life), when it comes to giving the reader useful experience in building their empathetic muscles, seeing these three worlds goes a long way. It reminds us that when we encounter people in the world, we encounter one facet of a multi-faceted personality.

542,"I've been doing a re-read of Arya's chapters and I forgot how endearing Hot Pie really is! He's like, sort of craven but he tries to do the right thing because Arya is there. And I feel like he helps remind us that they're just little kids caught up in a war. So I'd like to just highlight some of my favorite Hot Pie moments.

ARYA III, ACOK:

&gt;“I’m scared,” Hot Pie murmured when he saw the one-armed woman thrashing in the wagon.  
&gt;
&gt;“Me too,” Arya confessed.  
&gt;
&gt;He squeezed her shoulder. “I never truly kicked no boy to death, Arry. I just sold my mommy’s pies, is all.”

ARYA VII, ACOK:

&gt;Hot Pie ate even better; he was where he belonged, in the kitchens... Once he tried to slip her a hot apple tart, but he made such a clumsy job of it that two of the cooks saw. They took the tart away and beat him with a big wooden spoon.

ARYA II, ASOS:

&gt;Hot Pie piped up eagerly. “We're looking for Riverrun,” he said. “How many days' ride is it, do you know?”
&gt;
&gt;**Arya could have killed him**.

LMFAO

&gt;Hot Pie shifted in his seat. “I know the song about the bear,” he said. “Some of it, anyhow.” ... \[He\] joined in lustily, even bouncing in his saddle a little on the rhymes. Arya stared at him in astonishment. He had a good voice and sang well. *He never did anything well, except bake*, she thought to herself.

and

&gt;“Do I look like some bloody baker? I'd like to see you make better.”
&gt;
&gt;“I could,” said Hot Pie. “It's easy. You kneaded the dough too much, that's why it's so hard to chew.” He took another sip of ale, and began talking lovingly of breads and pies and tarts, all the things he loved. Arya rolled her eyes.

ARYA III, ASOS:

&gt;“I’m sorry I beat you that time,” she said. Hot Pie was stupid and craven, but he’d been with her all the way from King’s Landing and she’d gotten used to him. “I broke your nose.”  
&gt;
&gt;“You broke Lem’s too.” Hot Pie grinned. “That was good.”  
&gt;
&gt;“Lem didn’t think so,” Arya said glumly. Then it was time to go. When Hot Pie asked if he might kiss milady’s hand, she punched his shoulder. “Don’t call me that. You’re Hot Pie, and I’m Arry.”  
&gt;
&gt;“I’m not Hot Pie here. Sharna just calls me Boy. The same as she calls the other boy. It’s going to be confusing.”

ANYWAY yeah Hot Pie is the one true king yadda yadda.",asoiaf
543,"As repeatedly stated in interviews, one of Martin's inspirations for *A Song of Ice and Fire* is Robert Frost's poem *Fire and Ice:*

&gt;Some say the world will end in fire, 
&gt;
&gt;Some say in ice.
&gt;
&gt;From what I’ve tasted of desire
&gt;
&gt;I hold with those who favor fire.
&gt;
&gt;But if it had to perish twice,
&gt;
&gt;I think I know enough of hate
&gt;
&gt;To say that for destruction ice
&gt;
&gt;Is also great
&gt;
&gt;And would suffice.

The show revealed that - much in the fashion of the Robert Frost's poem - there are two parallel plots unraveling simultaneously within the structure of *A Song of Ice and Fire*: a so-called ""Fire Plot"" (being the plot of Civil War and Dany's Dragons) and ""Ice Plot"" (being the plot involving the Others and other magical elements). Both plots have an equal potential of destroying Westeros. For this reason of the dualistic nature of the Ice and Fire Plots embedded within the story's structure, I think that it is wrong to conflate the Azor Ahai prophecy and the Last Hero prophecy. Azor Ahai relates to the Fire Plot, full-filled by Jon and Dany, and the Last Hero relates to the Ice Plot, which I think Bran full-fills.

Here's the Last Hero story told by Old Nan to Bran himself way back in *AGOT*:

&gt;In that darkness, the Others came for the first time … They were cold things, dead things, that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every creature with hot blood in its veins. They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms, felled heroes and armies by the score, riding pale dead horses, and leading hosts of the slain. **All the swords of men could not stay their advance,** and even maidens and suckling babes, found no pity in them. They hunted the maids through the frozen forests, and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now these were the days before the Andals came, and long before the women fled across the narrow sea from the cities of the Rhoyne, and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the First Men, who had taken those lands from the children of the forest. Yet here and there in the fastness of the woods, the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills, and the faces in the trees kept watch. **So as cold and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the children, in the hopes that their ancient** **magics** **could win back what the armies of men had lost. He set out into the dead lands with a sword, a horse, a dog, and a dozen companions. For years he searched until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities. One by one his friends died, and his horse, and finally even his dog, and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it.** And the Others smelled the hot blood in him and came silent on his trail, stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as hounds –

The Last Hero story sounds alot like Bran's story: he traveled far Beyond the Wall, through the deep snows and harsh winds, sought out the Children of the Forest in their caves, lost his friends Hodor and Jojen, and even his dog Summer. Is it not fitting for Bran to full-fill the Last Hero prophecy that Old Nan told him in the first book? Is it not Martin's style to have a cripple be the Last Hero, subverting readers' expectations that it would be a warrior like Jon or Jamie?

Many asked themselves after the show ended, what's the point of Jon's story if he's not responsible for defeating the Others? Well I think the Azor Ahai is a broad allegory for the structure of Jon's story. Briefly, the prophecy states that Azor Ahai tempered his sword in water first, and then a lion, and both times the sword breaks. Finally he tempers his sword through his lover's heart, Nissa Nissa, and succeeds in forging Lightbringer and ending the darkness. If we interpret this more allegorically, Jon forging Lightbringer refers to forging peace throughout the Seven Kingdoms (a big part of his story after all has been forging peace and alliances between different peoples). Water - being of the same element as Ice - refers to the Others, and the loin refers to the Lannister Regime (and maybe their proxies, the Boltons and Littlefinger). Winning these two wars - first against the Others and then against (in the show at least) Cersei - fail to secure peace for the realm. Only after killing Dany, his Nissa Nissa, (possibly through the heart with Longclaw) will peace be secured throughout the realm (by abolishment of absolute monarchy for a more free government - whatever that may be).

Of course this means that the Azor Ahai prophecy doesn't refer to a hero ending the darkness brought by the Others. It refers to a hero ending the darkness brought by civil war (greatly exacerbated by the use of dragons, which may symbolize the introduction of advanced weaponry in real history). This is a well-done subversion by Martin (regardless how much the show may have messed this up). Readers have assumed that the Azor Ahai prophecy and Last Hero prophecy are one in the same - both relating to the Ice Plot - because Martin skillfully hides the Fire Plot from us until the end.

To conclude, I think it's quite obvious that Dany and Jon full-filled the Azor Ahai prophecy in the show. But, in order for my theory to have any weight, I must address the question: If Bran is the Last Hero why isn't he the one to kill the Night King in the show? I think because the show has always chosen to veer away from the more magical elements of the books, and given the self-imposed time restraints, they went for the predictable destroy-the-mother-ship-and-the-enemy-forces-instantly-disintegrates plot seen over and over again in fantasy and science fiction stories. This is how I think (broadly) it will play out in the books: Jon will muster forces from various kingdoms, including Dany's support, to fight the Others. There will be a Battle for the Dawn, perhaps in Winterfell or on the Trident (personally I like the idea of Stannis dying defending Winterfell and Jon and the Northern forces retreating South into the Civil War going on there). But - as the Last Hero prophecy says ""all the swords of men could not stay their advance"" - it will be ultimately up to Bran (using his new magical powers that the show failed to explain) to defeat the Others.

Anyway, wouldn't you feel better about Bran being King at the end if he was the Last Hero, eh?",asoiaf
544,"So I’ve read ASOIAF 3 times, and recently decided to listen to the audiobook version. Anyhow I just realized that Jon and Robb are older than Daenerys. They are both 14 and Dany is 13 at the start of AGOT. For some reason I always thought Dany was older.",asoiaf
545,"**Just to be clear, this post isn't about hating Arya, I like her and her chapters a lot.**

&amp;#x200B;

Game of Thrones is supposed to cover the same plot points that the books will cover, so now we know that Bran will be king, Dany will burn Kingslanding, Jon will kill Dany, Arya... will end the threat of the others??? I'm not entirely sure about this one.

&amp;#x200B;

The Night King is (as far as we know) a Show only character, and according to D&amp;D themselves, they've known that [Arya is going to be the one to kill the NK](https://youtu.be/ZJ1yC3yESLQ?t=532) for only three years. It's unclear if this is a GRRM decision or not, but it would be odd if he didn't tell them about such a seemingly important moment back in 2013 when he told them how the story ends. so it sounds like a D&amp;D decision. which is weird...

&amp;#x200B;

I find it concerning that it feels like D&amp;D are the ones who made that decision because that is her only contribution in the final act of the story, does this mean that GRRM provided basically nothing to D&amp;D in regards to Arya's story back in 2013? Does GRRM himself know what to do with her?

&amp;#x200B;

Arya is a weird character because unlike the other ASOIAF main characters, she isn't that involved in either the political game of thrones or the threat of the white walkers. I just struggle to see what's the point of her after how her story went in S7/8.",asoiaf

&gt; A Storm of Swords - Daenerys VI

&gt; “Your Grace?” Missandei stood at her elbow wrapped in a bedrobe, wooden sandals on her feet. “I woke, and saw that you were gone. Did you sleep well? What are you looking at?”

&gt; “My city,” said Dany. “I was looking for a house with a red door, but by night all the doors are black.”

&gt; “A red door?” Missandei was puzzled. “What house is this?”

&gt; “No house. It does not matter.” Dany took the younger girl by the hand. “Never lie to me, Missandei. Never betray me.”

&gt; “I never would,” Missandei promised.

&gt; A Dance with Dragons - Daenerys II

&gt; “Daenerys. Remember the Undying. Remember who you are.”

&gt; “The blood of the dragon.” _But my dragons are roaring in the darkness_. “I remember the Undying. _Child of three_, they called me. Three mounts they promised me, three fires, and three treasons. One for blood and one for gold and one for …”

&gt; “Your Grace?” Missandei stood in the door of the queen’s bedchamber, a lantern in her hand. “Who are you talking to?”

---

These two pieces fit perfectly with GRRM’s method of foreshadowing, suggesting that Missandei will be the treason for love. If it happened only once in ASoS, we might have thought GRRM could have easily set it aside if he wanted and perhaps he did so. Note that with a 5 year gap, Missandei would have been 15-16 by the time of this expected treason for love at the end. But GRRM doubles down on this in ADwD, despite dropping the 5 year gap in between, creating an extra book and doing massive revisions and retcons. Without a gap to age up Missandei, GRRM might perhaps find other types of love (e.g. family) to make the prophecy work.

I know that with the show’s ending in mind, Jon seems like the treason for love. But what about these clues? Can Missandei and Jon together have something to do with Dany’s downfall at the end? How do you think Missandei might feature into the treason for love (if at all)?

By the way, both instances take place just before the dawn.

I understand very few people will have read all three orders listed in the title, but for people who've read two or more of them or simply compared them in detail, I'm wondering what you consider to be the advantages and disadvantages of each.

551,"In a song of ice and fire we learn of the great tourney of Harrenhall. In this tale, the heroic Knight of the Laughing tree enters the list as a mystery knight. This person defeats 3 knights and implores them to chastise their squires in order to restore young Howland Reed's honor.  Lyanna Stark is the prime suspect as to the Knights identity.

In fire and blood a recurring theme is mystery knights. Fire and blood seems to be written as first a companion book to the song of ice and fire series, but also serves the purpose of planting ideas in the readers heads in relation to history repeating itself. 

The one that stands out the most to me is the recurring introduction of strong female mystery knights. These knights impress the Targaryans so much that they honor them all. This foreshadows the tourney at Harrenhall and possibly Lyanna stark impressing Rhegar so much, that he falls in love with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Evidence:

&amp;#x200B;

Jonquil dark enters the tourney of the Golden wedding. She is a fan favorite of the small folk. She leves such an impression on King Jahereys, that he enlists her as the sworn sheild to his sister/Wife Queen Alysanne.

Later at the tourney in white harbor, the mystery knight unmasked is a Wilding woman. So impressive was she, that the Queen honours her by commanding a dual between her and her newly appointed sworn shield.

552,"Note: this assumes that the end of the show was more or less the same as George’s intended ending on the major points. (the Others are defeated BEFORE Daenerys conquers KL, Dany burns KL, Jon kills Dany, Jon is exiled, King Bran)

I’ve always hated the “descent into Madness” or “Mad Queen” idea with Dany, (people use this term either as a shorthand for mental illness or just being “evil”) because it seems like such lazy plot development. For one thing, George has already set up Cersei to have a psychotic break, like Aerys (including wildfire), so why go to that well twice? To have a character who goes insane (legitimate mental illness, like Aerys) just because it’s supposedly in their genes is exceedingly lame and not where George is going IMO. (There are many examples that have been cited by people as evidence of Daenerys’ madness/insanity in the books and I’m perfectly happy to argue against them.)

I also despise the careless and ham fisted way the show handled her final “turn”. I think George FULLY intends for Daenerys to burn Kings Landing but the circumstances will be VERY different in the books. George will also not present her as a cartoonish villain with completely disgusting and over the top Nazi imagery.   George has not set up either of these developments (insane Dany/Nazi Dany) in the books. 

What George HAS done with Dany is to set up a character who will be *perceived* as a mad cruel tyrant by the Westerosi characters without actually *being* one. What George is doing with her is playing with the notion that the hero is actually the villain from the other sides’ point of view. Try to imagine how Daenerys would appear to you as a reader if you never got her POV? 

Without having Daenerys’ POV, you would be subject to the same information asymmetry about her as the characters in the story are. In AFFC/ADWD we are introduced to wild calumnies spread about her by her enemies in Slavers bay. As readers we would hear these stories exactly as the characters in the novel do. We would be told that the daughter of the mad king, has sacked “ancient and peaceful cities”, “burned diplomatic envoys”, “crucified noblemen”, “broken peace treaties” and “lays with beasts as well as men.” 

By the time we get to Daenerys’ arrival in Westeros, in either TWOW or ADOS, the reader without Dany’s POV, will see Daenerys just as a Westerosi character will see her. By that time, Daenerys will (in all likelihood) have sacked Yunkai, Volantis ,and Pentos. She will have three monstrous dragons in Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal. She will have a massive army of Dothraki “savages”, “slave soldiers”, sell swords, and foreign religious fanatics. Her Westerosi elements will be Iron Born reavers and the most hated man in Westeros, Tyrion Lannister. Westerosi characters will see Daenerys an apocalyptic villain, the Mad King’s daughter come with an unholy army, to kill them all.

When Daenerys burns Kings Landing, killing their beloved King Aegon in the process(and they will absolutely love him). She will have confirmed for Westeros all of their worst fears about her. Without her POV, she would also appear to the reader as an irredeemable monster. One who’s motives, goals, and drives cannot be understood. She would be just another “Dark Lord” trope. 

By giving us Daenerys’ point of view, and making her such a sympathetic and heroic character. George instead allows us to see her at the end, as a tragic, fallen hero. One who is brought down, not by a fault in her genes or a twist of fate, but by the consequences of choices she made(and how others respond to those choices). 

Most importantly, we will understand *why* she makes the choices she makes and maybe even sympathize with them. I’ve said earlier that burning Kings Landing will take place in a different fashion in George’s version than in the show, and this is what I mean. George has very carefully set up Daenerys to:

1) Be *perceived* as a monster by Westeros, as I have already shown.
2) Embrace “Fire and Blood” and reject peaceful negotiations with her enemies. By the end of ADWD, Dany has decided that the cost of peace with the Slavers is too high. To Daenerys, “the peace”feels like defeat(She’s correct), that the Slavers are not acting in good faith(correct again) and are actively seeking to destroy her once and for all(correct again). Daenerys has made the choice to embrace war and conquest. Embracing “Fire and Blood”, her dragon nature, means that Daenerys must accept civilian deaths as a price worth paying for victory. (a tragically wrong decision) When she forgets Hazzea’s name, (the girl Drogon killed) it is symbolic of her making this decision. 

Now, having Daenerys be *unconcerned* with civilian casualties, in the process of defeating her enemies is well within what George has set up. She can unleash her Dragons against (f)Aegon and kill many tens of thousands of innocents in the process, and this would entirely fit what George has been setting up. However there is a VERY big difference morally between being *unconcerned* with civilian casualties to win a War, and *deliberately* trying to kill as many civilians as possible AFTER you’ve already won. George has not set up Daenerys to behave in this way. This combined with the over the top Nazi/First Order imagery, as seen in the show, created a situation where the Daenerys is not the tragic fallen hero George intends her to be, but is instead a cartoonish monster. The Westerosi characters would therefore be *objectively* correct in seeing her this way, rather than correct from their own point of view.",asoiaf
553,"I've just finished reading Cersei II, which was probably one of my favourite chapters in the series so far. GRRM does a fantastic job at highlighting Cersei's descent into madness and paranoia, and how she thinks she's a master of the game after rebuffiing Mace Tyrell, only for Kevan to run rings around her at dinner at the end of the chapter.

I'm disappointed they didn't include the scene where Kevan refuses to become Hand, especially because of that final line about Tommen - ""'Aye,' he added softly, after a pause, 'and his father too I think.'"" 

Reading AFFC has been a different experience for me because whereas in Books 1-3 I mostly could align the books with a scene in the show, obviously AFFC was where the big variations and omissions started happening.

554,"Before I interacted with the fandom in any capacity, I had never ever thought about Jon Snow having a ""real"" Targaryen name. I had always assumed he would be Jon Targaryen or Jon Snow still, if Rhaegar and Lyanna had never officially married.

When Rhaegar left Lyanna, he only knew she was pregnant, not the sex of the child. Being as obsessed with prophecies as he was, he likely was expecting a daughter, a Visenya, the third head of the dragon, and never even considered having another son, leaving no instructions for Lyanna on how to name him.

Lyanna was dying. It is likely she never got to name her son or never got to tell Ned the name. Even if she did, at this point Rhaegar, Aerys, Elia, Rhaenys, Aegon were all killed. The Targaryens were crushed. Why would she give her son a Targaryen name, knowing it would put him in danger and Ned would have to rename him anyway?

In conclusion, realistically, it is likely neither Rhaegar nor Lyanna had the chance to name Jon.

3. Ellaria and the Sand Snakes are skeptical of this plan. Tyene sets out to sabotage it.
4. Myrcella is pregnant w/ Trystane's child and Doran holds her hostage in the Spear Tower.
5. Trystane objects to wife's captivity, and wants to ditch the imminent war and run away with Myrcella.
6. Jaime shows up to rescue Myrcella from captivity, along with Bronn, Ilyn Payne and a few red shirts.
7. A Tower of Joy style confrontation occurs. Areo Hotah is killed.
8. Jaime accidentally kills Trystane. Myrcella's baby is stillborn. She dies due to childbirth/grief/poison.
9. Trystane's death pushes Doran to declare war. Ellaria introduces him to Varys, who she's been plotting with.

There's plenty of lovely potential brides: Asha Greyjoy (to strengthen the ties between the iron islands and the IT), Desmera Redwyne (powerful house), Malora Hightower(another powerful house). I'm not sure if Arianne would be a good bride at this time cus Oberyn was killed.

At the end of the conversation, Sansa thinks to herself the following : ""***And may your horse stumble, Harry the Heir, so you fall on your stupid head in your*** ***first*** ***tilt***.""

To which I replied

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Oddly enough, Sansa curses another jouster, during the celebrations for Joffrey's birthday.*  
&gt;  
&gt;""Ser Balon Swann, of Stonehelm in the Red Watch,"" came the herald's cry. Wide white wings ornamented Ser Balon's greathelm, and black and white swans fought on his shield. ""Morros of House Slynt, heir to Lord Janos of Harrenhal.""  
""Look at that upjumped oaf,"" Joff hooted, loud enough for half the yard to hear. Morros, a mere squire and a new-made squire at that, was having difficulty managing lance and shield. The lance was a knight's weapon, Sansa knew, the Slynts lowborn. Lord Janos had been no more than commander of the City Watch before Joffrey had raised him to Harrenhal and the council.  
I hope he falls and shames himself, she thought bitterly. I hope Ser Balon kills him. When Joffrey proclaimed her father's death, it had been Janos Slynt who seized Lord Eddard's severed head by the hair and raised it on high for king and crowd to behold, while Sansa wept and screamed.  
Morros wore a checkered black-and-gold cloak over black armor inlaid with golden scrollwork. On his shield was the bloody spear his father had chosen as the sigil of their new-made house. But he did not seem to know what to do with the shield as he urged his horse forward, and Ser Balon's point struck the blazon square. Morros dropped his lance, fought for balance, and lost. One foot caught in a stirrup as he fell, and the runaway charger dragged the youth to the end of the lists, head bouncing against the ground. Joff hooted derision. Sansa was appalled, wondering if the gods had heard her vengeful prayer. But when they disentangled Morros Slynt from his horse, they found him bloodied but alive.

&gt;*A Clash of Kings* \- Sansa I  

&amp;#x200B;

It seemed odd that GRRM would have two instances of Sansa ill-wishing the participant of a tourney, with such similar wording.  While neither curse is spoken aloud, thank the old gods and the new, we readers are aware Sansa, quite understandably, has indulged in a very dangerous line of thought. In Westerosi history women who curse others normally do so before their deaths. F&amp;B I has a number of such instances,  most notably Queen Rhaenyra. 

   

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, we have another other curse  to consider here, perhaps the most famous of Sansa's curses, given the fact that GGRM is recorded as having changed the manner of Janos Slynt's death to accomodate it

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Frog-faced Lord Slynt sat at the end of the council table wearing a black velvet doublet and a shiny cloth-of-gold cape, nodding with approval every time the king pronounced a sentence. **Sansa stared hard at his ugly face, remembering how he had thrown down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead, wishing she could hurt him, wishing that some hero would throw him down and cut off his head.** But a voice inside her whispered, There are no heroes, and she remembered what Lord Petyr had said to her, here in this very hall. ""Life is not a song, sweetling,"" he'd told her. ""You may learn that one day to your sorrow."" In life, the monsters win, she told herself, and now it was the Hound's voice she heard, a cold rasp, metal on stone. ""Save yourself some pain, girl, and give him what he wants.""   

 *A Game of Thrones* \- Sansa VI

My bolding.

We know how Janos Slynt died 

&gt; The smile that Lord Janos Slynt smiled then had all the sweetness of rancid butter. Until Jon said, ""Edd, fetch me a block,"" and unsheathed Longclaw.

That's three men cursed or ill-wished, which seems to be pointing to something dark in Sansa's future. Will she become aware she's capable of ill-wishing others?

Most disquieting, in light of those curses, is this superstitious   view of her

I fear Sansa is either going to be accused of witchcraft by others, possibly at King's Landing, or worse yet, accuses herself of witchcraft.  

Is it possible Sansa will understand her warg nature, which I think, will eventually bloom, in terms of witchcraft?  

Her siblings all take their warg nature in different ways.  

It's implied Robb uses his to help win battles, that Jon fights against his nature, that Bran is capable of flying high yet sinking into abomination for his own pleasure, that Arya accepts her abiblities with without questioning them and Rickon, well, we have yet to learn about Rickon's path as a warg.  

&amp;#x200B;

It could be divided between the Riverlands and the Stormlands like before the Conquest but it’s been it’s own political entity for 300 years and was never strongly held by the other kingdoms. I would guess it would be renamed something like the Bay and be put under a new Lord Paramount.

At the end of ADWD the Rosby inheritance is an open question. One of the claims belongs to Bronn’s wife Lollys Stokeworth. If she wins the claim House Stokeworth would be one of the most powerful houses in the Crownlands.

They could be given permission to rebuild the nearby King’s Landing and make use of it’s port. They would be a good candidate for Lordship Paramount.

Interestingly House Stokeworth’s coat of arms is relatively simple like the other Lord’s Paramount.

563,"For example, cropping, blurring, or cutting it out entirely etc. also, notable censored scenes",asoiaf
564,"I (along with plenty others) have been thinking a lot about Daenerys's fall into madness in GoT S8. Everyone knows how poorly it was handled, but part of me wonders if somewhere in this mess of a character arc there's a seed of something GRRM intended for her from the start that D&amp;D botched. It's recently come out that King Bran was an idea GRRM gave to D&amp;D ahead of time, along with ""Hodor = Hold the door"". If this is the case for Bran, could Dany's fall from grace be something else GRRM prompted for D&amp;D?

First of all we have to look at who Dany is. My knowledge of her right now is based only on what I've seen in the show and what I've read in the first book, so there may be some things I'm missing. But my impression is that Daenerys Targaryen is a girl who, after enduring prolonged abuse and objectification in unfamiliar countries amidst hostile people, developed a strong sense of justice for the innocent and a refusal to negotiate with those who subjugate and oppress the less fortunate.

No matter how you cut it, justice for the innocent isn't an ideology that allows for the massacre of one million people after an unconditional surrender. However, I think it's an ideology that may still allow for a fall from grace. In S5, we see how Dany's justice isn't quite as effective once she starts to experience the gray morals of a world she'd seen as black and white. 

Without getting too political, I think it can be said that those who have genuinely good intentions can still do harm to others. A black and white view of the world leads to generalizations, which in turn lead to misunderstandings and divisions, which in turn creates conflicts that could be avoided through a less binary view of morality and the world. With Danaerys set up to inherit a great amount of power and influence, this ideology could over time lead to tyranny despite her good intentions.

In the end, I think that Dany's fall from grace won't come from unchecked slaughter, but from her refusal to bend her view of justice in the face of a world more ambiguous than she believed it to be. I think in *The Winds of Winter* and *A Dream of Spring*, the story of Daenerys Targaryen will end as a cautionary tale of the good that justice can do in a cruel world while also warning against letting justice create tyrants.",asoiaf
565,"I've always wondered why GRRM would tell us his planned ending. He's worked so hard at building suspense and writing the unthinkable, keeping his readers on their toes while his characters do the unexpected. Knowing the basic outline completely destroyes the shock value when it happens, regardless of the story buildup to it. 
So why tell us the ending?

But, what if he hasn't? We have all just assumed that the books will end basically as the show did, have we all thrown away the possibility that they don't? 

Maybe GRRM didnt tell D&amp;D his true ending. Maybe he did and they decided not to spoil it. After all, after season 8 episode 3, they did admit that they ""decided Arya would defeat the Night King in season 3"" but if they already knew the ending, why would they choose to change it so early? 
Obviously none of us were there at lunch with them that day so theres no way we know what was said, we are only just assuming theyre telling the truth. (Yes, I know he expected to finish the books before the show but if that was the case then it could be argued that he would just wait to tell them)
My point is, we are just believing the heresay but it is very well possible that we DONT know the ""basic outline"" of how it will all end.  Maybe we do. But maybe we dont. 

It just doesn't seem like GRRM to let on what is going to happen.",asoiaf
566,"So I'm sure this has been discussed for years now, but I'm a new reader who just got into the series after season 8 subverted my expectations of a proper ending, so this is all fresh to me. 

Anyway I just reached the chapter in ASOS where Robb and the Blackfish return to Rivverun and get pissed with Edmure for pushing Tywin back. In the show, they painted this as an utter tactical failure by Edmure and make him into an incompetent buffoon pretty much for the rest of the series. But with the expanded explanation of exactly what is going on from ACOK and ASOS, I'm totally team Edmure on this one. Robb literally never tells him his supposedly genius plan to trap Tywin in the Westerlands, merely tells him to stay put and hold Riverrun. This basically means sacrificing all of the smallfolk outside of the city walls, turning Edmure's lands into a burned out wasteland like the rest of the Trident is. 

Edmure saved all of his people and is a hero. Robb fucked up about 1000x worse by marrying Jayne Westerling and has no right to insult Ed like that. Sure Robb, your tactical plan was really smart, but if you don't tell your commanders it was probably doomed from the start. It also makes you a massive douchebag when you call your bannerman out for saving the lives of all his people when he was working with an incomplete picture of how the battle would affect the war as a whole. 

On top of all the injustices done to Edmure by Catelyn, Robb, and Brynden, he still immediately apologizes when he realizes he made a ""mistake"" and offers to do *anything* to make it right. True team player right here, who really just has everyone's best interests at heart. In response to this, he has to fix all of Robb's mistakes in addition to his own. 

Anyway, Edmure deserves better. He is quickly becoming one of my favorite characters simply because he is consistently doing the right thing and everyone consistently underestimates him no matter how much good he does. The only bad part of his characterization is I now have another reason for hating the show. They basically took the biased view of him Catelyn has, and made it his actual character for some reason.",asoiaf

While Gendry was raised in Flea Bottom, Edric Storm was raised in Storm's End itself. And what's more, the castellan of that castle was prepared to die to protect Edric. So he obviously inspires some degree of loyalty already. I think he's also the only one of Robert's bastards officially recognized by the man himself.

Of course, the high lords of the Stormlands would be reluctant to accept a bastard of any stripe as their supreme overlord, literate or no.

Still, he would be carrying on the Baratheon name and legacy where previously it might've gone extinct.

574," The Prince that was Promised Prophecy is a central and important prophecy to the end game of A Song of Ice and Fire. However;

*there is no listed year for the woods witch prophecy or Aerys and Rhaella’s wedding.*

Luckily, we do have a few textual clues that allow us to piece together a timeline. In ADWD, Barristan tells Daenerys

*""I saw your father and your mother wed. Forgive me, but there was no fondness there, and the realm paid dearly for that, my queen...” (ADWD).*

When Daenerys asks why they married if they did not love one another, Barristan responds that, *""Your grandsire commanded it. A woods witch had told him that the prince was promised would be born of their line"" (ADWD).*

He continues on to explain that the woods witch, *“... came to court with Jenny of Oldstones. A stunted thing, grotesque to look upon…” (ADWD).*

Barristan’s ability to provide a first-hand account of the woods witch physical appearance (*A stunted thing, grotesque to look upon)* is an indication that he was present at court when she provided the prophecy. We know that this prophecy was provided prior to the Tragedy of Summerhall. Barristan appearing at court in Kingslanding would have been a rare thing prior to his naming to the Kingsguard *after* the Tragedy of Summerhall.

Fortunately, we know of one other juncture in the story where Barristan was in King’s Landing. In ASOS, Jaime reads from The White Book that Barristan Selmy was, “Knighted in his 16th year by King Aegon V Targaryen, after performing great feats of prowess as a mystery knight in the winter tourney at King's Landing…” (ADWD). This tourney is dated as 252/253AC, which also adds up correctly with Barristan’s age of 16 at the time of the tourney.

Due to Barristan’s first-hand account of the woods witch and his known attendance at the tourney in King’s Landing, it is very likely that the woods witch provides the prophecy to Prince Jaehaerys in either late 252 or early 253AC.

The Ghost of High Heart provided the Prince that was Promised prophecy to Prince Jaehaerys at the Winter Tourney of 252AC.",asoiaf

&gt;Even among the wildlings, these skinchangers were feared as unnatural men who could call on animals as allies. 

TWOIAF, Ancient History: The Dawn Age

&gt;Though the black brothers of the Watch still guard the realms of men as nobly as they may, the threats they face no longer come from Others, wights, giants, greenseers, wargs, skinchangers, and other monsters from children's tales and legend...

TWOIAF, The Wall and Beyond, The Night's Watch

&gt;Chronicles found in the archives of the Night's Watch at the Nightfort (before it was abandoned) speak of the war for Sea Dragon Point, wherein the Starks brought down the Warg King and his inhuman allies, the children of the forest. When the Warg King's last redoubt fell, his sons were put to the sword, along with his beasts and greenseers, whilst his daughters were taken as prizes by their conquerors.

TWOIAF, The North: The Kings of Winter

It has been thoroughly established in the books that wargs, skinchangers, and greenseers are the target of great hostility and prejudice in Westeros, and that hostility deepens the further South one goes. The Old Gods may be tolerated in the South in the interest of reducing religious strife, but people like Bran with actual powers are the stuff Southern parents use to frighten misbehaved children.

In my mind this poses an enormous problem for the show's ending if it is indeed GRRM's intended ending. Let's assume Evil Bran believers are not correct, and Bran (or Bloodraven in a hollowed out Bran shell) doesn't conquer Westeros against its will through shadowy manipulation or sheer magical power. If that's the case there are two equally unlikely possibilities. Either Bran has to conceal his abilities and win an election on his non-magical merits, as a crippled teenage boy from a house that has few Southern friends and zero claim on the Iron Throne. Or he has to do something so universally impressive with his abilities that the people of the Southern kingdoms decide to elect *the Bogeyman* king.

It will be difficult but doable for Bran to retain his hereditary seat of Winterfell despite the prejudice against him. He might even achieve Northern independence and rule as KitN. But the idea of Bran ruling the Southern kingdoms after being freely elected seems bizarre.

**TL;DR Bran is going to be an abomination in the eyes of most of his Southern subjects.**",asoiaf

The Meereenese Knot was a major narrative problem dealing with the confluence of several viewpoint characters (Daenerys, Quentyn, Victarion and Tyrion), several major plot elements (Sons of the Harpy insurgency, Yunkish siege, Drogon's return, plague) and how the timing of everything plagued George RR Martin in writing and finishing ADWD.

Here's George talking about it in 2012:

&gt; Questioner: ""Now that we know how the ""Meereenese knot"" played out, what was the problem with this? For example, was it the order in which Dany met various characters, or who, when, and how someone would try to take the dragons?""

&gt; **GRRM**: ""Now I can explain things. It was a confluence of many, many factors: lets start with the offer from Xaro to give Dany ships, the refusal of which then leads to Qarth's declaration of war. Then there's the marriage of Daenerys to pacify the city. Then there's the arrival of the Yunkish army at the gates of Meereen, there's the order of arrival of various people going her way (Tyrion, Quentyn, Victarion, Aegon, Marwyn, etc.), and then there's Daario, this dangerous sellsword and the question of whether Dany really wants him or not, there's the plague, there's Drogon's return to Meereen ... - [So Spake Martin, 7/28/2012](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Asshai.com_Interview_in_Barcelona/)

This is all well-trod ground that I've covered in a few previous analyses ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2pp2m8/spoilers_all_an_analysis_exploration_of_grrms/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9q3bfe/spoilers_twow_grrms_adwdtwow_writing_timeline_it/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/6mtciz/spoilers_extended_six_years_ago_today_a_dance/) for instance). But while a lot of the major elements of the Meereenese Knot have been unpacked, I believe there's more elements to discover.

And I think I've hit on one of those elements: **That a late ADWD chapter was originally going to be written from one POV character's perspective, but GRRM later discarded this particular draft of the chapter before picking that draft chapter back up and rewriting it with the perspective of a brand, new POV.**

Are you confused? Good. It only gets more granular from here on out!
***
##POV Changes

Let's talk a little theory before we get into some more solid material. ADWD was a beast of a book to write. While the cast of characters was quite vast by ADWD (16 POV Characters with an additional Prologue and Epilogue POV), the major problem was a viewpoint problem in Meereen.

In Meereen, GRRM always knew that Daenerys Targaryen was going to depart Meereen atop Drogon for the Dothraki Sea. In fact, [a very early Dany POV chapter](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/asoiaf/daenerys-ii-spoilers-for-adwd-t3024.html#.UYrHqisQIWA) that [George wrote back in 2001](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/5431) featured the return of Drogon (Whether Dany was going to fly off with Drogon then or later remains a question in my mind).

But this presented the narrative with a problem: Who would tell the story of Meereen in Dany's absence? In that, GRRM had possible candidates, but they presented flaws:

- Tyrion Lannister was coming to Daenerys with the intent that he would ""intersect"" with the Dragon Queen at some point in the story. But the problem was that he was unfamiliar with Meereen, its language, its culture and the various players orbiting Daenerys' court in Meereen.
- Quentyn Martell was also coming for Dany, but, like Tyrion, he was an outsider to Meereen.
- Victarion was on his way to Meereen as well, but he is an idiot.

So, GRRM attempted to cut the Meereenese Knot but kept [running into problems.](https://grrm.livejournal.com/94671.html) until in 2010, GRRM came upon a solution: [introduce Ser Barristan Selmy as a POV Character.](https://grrm.livejournal.com/129885.html) In Barristan, George was able to have an insider within Meereen who know the plots and players yet remained something of an outsider who could function in the vital plot roles of taking down Hizdahr zo Loraq and re-igniting the Sons of the Harpy insurgency and the Battle of Fire.

The Meereenese Knot, Barristan as a POV Character and his role in slashing the Meereenese Knot is well-known at this point. But what's not so well known is **how** Barristan actually helped George to cut the Meereenese Knot.
***
##Abandoned Drafts 

In 2016, GRRM was asked a question (h/t /u/zionius_ for the link):

&gt; Questioner: ""Do you often write the different outcomes of a chapter from both P.O.V. characters who share the same setting? TWOW has so many of them converging, I could understand you wanting to see which is the stronger route to go if you were to see it from the opposite perspective.""

He responded:

&gt; **GRRM:** I did some of that (My Editorial note: *switching POVs*) in DANCE when I was struggling with the Meereenese knot, and also in FEAST with those kingsmoot chapters ... but elsewise, nah, usually know which POV will work best before I begin. - [GRRM Notablog Comment, ""A Taste of This, A Taste of That"", 5/11/2016](https://grrm.livejournal.com/487298.html?page=6#comments)

I had never read this quote before /u/zionius_ brought it to my attention, but it made me wonder: *What POVs did George switch for the Meereenese Knot in ADWD?* And then it dawned on me: **Barristan Selmy.** Yes, our stalwart kingsguard knight was introduced with the intent to cut the Meereenese Knot. So, it would make logical sense that George switched him in for other POV characters in Meereen.

Then I wondered whether there was a particular place where one POV was replaced and Barristan was added in. And I *think* I found at least one example so far: **[ADWD, The Discarded Knight.](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Dance_with_Dragons-Chapter_59)**

Now, you'd be forgiven if you don't quite remember what occurred in this chapter. Briefly, it's a single-scene chapter set against an audience of King Hizdahr zo Loraq. The Yunkish come to Hizdahr's court and toss the head of Admiral Groleo at Hizdahr's feet and then demand the destruction of Dany's two remaining dragons.

But there's another piece in the chapter: Barristan notices that Quentyn and his Dornish companions are in the throne room, and after the audience is done, he confronts Quentyn and his companions and tells them to get out of dodge before they get themselves killed. 

So, we have Quentyn and Barristan present in a single-scene chapter. This is a likely spot where George replaced Quentyn with Barristan as the POV for the chapter. But I think this one actually goes beyond ""likely theory."" Because! 

In that same *So Spake Martin* from 2012 that I quoted in the intro, George talked more about Quentyn Martell and his role within the Meereenese Knot. And he said something fascinating about how he wrote Quentyn's introduction to Meereen. Namely, **George wrote three version of Quentyn's arrival in Meereen.** 

And one of those draft versions of when Quentyn arrives in Meereen is quite intriguing for our purposes:

&gt; I wrote three different versions of Quentyn's arrival at Meereen: one where he arrived long before Dany's marriage, **one where he arrived much later**, and one where he arrived just the day before the marriage (which is how it ended up being in the novel). And I had to write all three versions to be able to compare and see how these different arrival points affected the stories of the other characters."" - [So Spake Martin, 7/28/2012](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Asshai.com_Interview_in_Barcelona/)

So, here's what I think happened. In 2007, George wrote an [ADWD chapter](https://grrm.livejournal.com/15293.html) about ""a wedding."" I think this was likely Dany's marriage to Hizdahr zo Loraq as [a week prior](https://grrm.livejournal.com/15035.html) to writing this wedding chapter, GRRM was full of ""Dany, Jon and ""Q"" (Probably Quentyn Martell) thoughts."" At some point between 2007 and 2010, GRRM did some experimentation with drafting three different versions of Quentyn's arrival in Meereen. One of those version was Quentyn arriving ""much later"" in the narrative. I think that draft chapter was abandoned by GRRM as he decided on having Quentyn arrive a day before Dany's marriage to Hizdahr zo Loraq.

But! **I think much later on, GRRM ended up resurrecting this ""Quentyn arrives long after Dany is married to Hizdahr"" draft chapter, rewriting it with Barristan Selmy as the POV Character.** I'd go on to say that ""The Discarded Knight"" was among the final chapters that GRRM wrote for ADWD as he talked about finishing ""two short chapters"" in [late March 2011](https://grrm.livejournal.com/204875.html), and ""The Discarded Knight"" is a short late-ADWD chapter.
***
##Conclusion

The more I delve into GRRM's writing of ADWD, the more I find it fascinating. Perhaps part of my fascinating derives from a shared sympathy of the burden of writing fiction and how rewriting is extraordinarily difficult but ultimately rewarding. 

Part of my fascinating, too, is my belief that ADWD remains George's best book in ASOIAF. Seeing the amount of George's effort and finally noticing some of the details of how the effort came about makes the book that much more enjoyable.

So, I've thrown a lot of words at unpacking what I think is one instance where George switched Barristan in as a POV for a chapter that was likely-written from the POV of Quentyn Martell. Now, I turn it over to you all. In that notablog quote, George indicated that there were ""some"" instances where he switched the POV of certain chapters. What other examples of ADWD or AFFC chapters (remember GRRM talked about switching the kingsmoot POVs around too!) do you see where GRRM changed the POV Character?

579,"Imagine this ending:

Jon is contending with undead Viseryon.  Everyone is nearly dead or dying.  Theon is down.  And...

A pack of 500 wolves bounds over the wall of the castle, climbing the dead.  Nymeria howls atop the ramparts, catching the dragon's attention.  The wolves swarm the dragon and it flies off.

Jon runs for the Godswood, Arya drops from the wall in an acrobatic flip.  They make eye contact, then make eye contact with Nymeria and now Ghost.  They charge down the corridor, a dozen wolves and the dire wolves overtaking them.  The battle some White Walkers, killing a few.  Viseryon lands in the Godswood, they take cover.  Jon is nearly roasted but a hand grabs him.  Theon is clutching his guts, is pale, but still living.  Jon gives him a look.

Theon says, ""what is dead may never die.""

Rhaegal swoops in and battles with Viseryon.  A host of crows flies in to blind and confuse Viseryon, pecking at his neck wound.   In a surprise move, Rhaegal bites off the dragon's neck.  The dead swarm Rhaegal, who flies off, but served as a good distraction for the dead in the Godswood.

Theon and Jon rush the Night King, with the wolves, and the crows.  Theon dies but only two White Walkers are left.  The Night King charges Bran.  Jon is charging, but begins to slow, raising his sword after coming upon the White Walkers.  Arya leaps out of nowhere at the Night King, forcing him to stop his charge and block, losing some footing when the crows attack him.  Arya keeps running and in one motion assassinates both white walkers.  The dead are now all in the fight.  Jon steps on a pile of dead, his body flies into a White Walker just as it turns to mist, and a hoary Jon charges to the Night King who turns to fight.  Surrounded by crows, after 10 seconds of brutal swordplay as the dead charge in, Jon swipes the Night King and wins the battle.",asoiaf
580,"Hello,
Just finished reading the insightful thread by u/blackofhairandheart2 on the possible future Dunk and Egg stories. I just finished A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, which I thoroughly enjoyed.

One question I had about The Mystery Knight is, 
what was the master plan behind Gormon Peake bringing John the Fiddler to Whitewalls?

I understand the reasoning behind gathering lords and knights who might be loyal to the Blackfyres, but I don't fully understand how setting up Daemon II to win the jousting tournament would spark a rebellion. There is a line in the story about people being more likely to support someone who is good at fighting, but I'm having trouble imagining what Peake and Tommard Heddle thought would happen.


1. John The Fiddler wins the tournament and is revealed to be Daemon II.
2. Daemon II is awarded the dragon egg as tournament prize.
3. Dragon hatches. (which the story reveals is really meant to be the rise to power of Aegon V, ""the Dragon's 'Egg'"").
4.  ...
5. Profit?",asoiaf

That scene might or might not have been interesting as a battle, but it would have saved the episode and maybe the season narratively.  First, it would have explained why Bran was warging during the battle, which is never explained.  Second, it would have showed us that Bran helped defeat the Others, which would have given his whole 3ER arc meaning.

585,"Remember how many of us spent half of *Game of Thrones* season eight trying to figure out if Cersei Lannister was [actually pregnant](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/04/game-of-thrones-cersei-pregnant-wine-lying-miscarriage)? Sure, she stopped glugging wine in season seven, but very quickly in season eight she was back to her old habits—despite having told Jaime that she was pregnant with their fourth child. But as it turns out, Cersei really was pregnant. And as **Lena Headey** recently explained, one very important scene for the character ended up being cut—one that would have cast her in a very different light in the final season.

&amp;#x200B;

“We shot a scene that never made it into season seven, which was where I lose the baby,” Headey [said](https://twitter.com/bb_cersei/status/1139909967803113472) at a fan convention. “And it was a really kind of traumatic, great moment for Cersei that never made it in, and I kind of loved doing that because I thought it would have served her differently.”

&amp;#x200B;

The show itself *did* drop a few hints that Cersei’s pregnancy was genuine, and that she had miscarried—as did **George R.R. Martin**’s books. As *V.F.*’s **Joanna Robinson** [pointed out](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/04/game-of-thrones-cersei-pregnant-wine-lying-miscarriage) during season eight’s run, a few portions of stage direction from season seven’s scripts gestured in that direction—passages like when Cersei first tells Jaime she’s carrying his child: “She nods, it’s true.… Her happiness is contagious. They get another chance at family. This time with no one standing in their way.” Or when Tyrion figures out that she’s pregnant: “Tyrion sees what he sees and knows what it means. He can hardly believe it, but knows it to be true.… She stays silent for too long, long enough to tell him that he’s right. And once she knows he knows, she can think of nothing else to say.” The books also contained quiet clues that Cersei was pregnant, including the note that her clothes had gotten tighter.

Some fans thought Cersei was faking her pregnancy because of the prophecy she received when she was young: that she would carry three children. But a miscarriage, obviously, would have allowed her to be pregnant once more without violating what was foretold. And as Robinson pointed out, the books *did* contain a subtle but convincing foreshadowing that just that would happen: “To break her fast the queen sent to the kitchens for two boiled eggs, a loaf of bread, and a pot of honey. But when she cracked the first egg and found a bloody half-formed chick inside, her stomach roiled.”

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/k5e4quprhb531.png

&amp;#x200B;

Looking back, the moment when Cersei took a prominent swig of her wine in season eight seems poignant; the sour, forlorn expression on her face was inscrutable at the time, but heartbreaking in retrospect. One could argue that such subtlety mimicked what happens in the books—but making the truth more explicitly clear would likely have served the show better. The confusion surrounding Cersei’s maybe-fake pregnancy clouded her true motivations for most of the season, creating an emotional distance from the character that made her death have a smaller impact than it could have. Headey herself has expressed some disappointment with her character’s demise; in a [recent interview](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/game-of-thrones-star-lena-headey-wanted-a-better-death-circe) she said, “I’ve got a few of my own gripes. But I haven’t sat down drunkly with **David \[Benioff\]** and **Dan \[Weiss\]** yet.… I will say I wanted a better death.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Obviously you dream of your death,” Headey continued. “You could go in any way on that show. So I was kind of gutted. But I just think they couldn’t have pleased everyone. No matter what they did, I think there was going to be some big comedown from the climb.”

So while at Target the other day I browsed through Fire &amp; Blood to see if I'd be interested in it after I finish the first 5 ASOIAF books. I really enjoyed much of it far more than I imagined, as Valyrian/Targ stuff doesn't interest me as much as my fervent obsession with all things Stark, Northern and White Walker. But while browsing the illustration of Aerea dying on the Maesters table really stood out to me. I read the accompanying pages assuming to read a tale about a Targaryen stricke  with Greyscale. 

I couldn't have been more wrong. What passages followed simultaneously awed, terrified and utterly disturbed me beyond what I imagined the book capable of. And now more than 5 days later...I still can't get the images out of my head. The melting eyeballs, the squirming lumps underneath her skin, the steam erupting from every bodily orifice...even her nether regions.

But worst of all was the creatures themselves. Worms with faces he recalled. He said they made HORRIFIC and disturbingly grotesque noises. What sort of faces? Were these human like faces? Were they simply animalistic faces comparable to a snakes ""face"" (i.e. two eyes and a mouth?) Or was it something more diabolical and demonic? The Maester even mentions as much wondering aloud if such demonic entities such as those preached by the followers of R'hollir as existing to serve the Great Other and enemies of R'hollir? What noise did they make? Was it akin to speech? Was it just animal sounds or was it the sounds of sapient creatures dying in pain? And most haunting of all...what the hell actually happened to this poor child? I had read someones theory online that it could gave been how Wyrms or Firewyrms reproduce a la Xenomorphs from the Alien series. Mayhaps they bite somebody and  lay their eggs inside a host needed as a kind of incubator and then hatch? Sort've akin to bot flies or mangoworms in the real world? 

Or could it be some kind of Valyrian blood magic ritual to bring about Dragons as another user hypothesized? That Valyrians are not actually ""blood of the Dragon"" but in actuality the Dragons themselves are blood of the Valyrians or Targaryens? Could Dragons be some kind of sentient hybrid of Valyrians and Wyverns created through some perverse blood magic ritual? 

The story simply begs SO many questions and none with any concrete answers. Most curious is the large wounds on Balerion the Black Dread. Is what attacked him also responsible for the Princess's horrific condition? One of my theories when first reading it were that perhaps Aerea was the unfortunate victim of some group of post cataclysmic Valyrian cultists who tried to use her as a vessel to create more Dragons? My mind still races with hundreds of thoughts and potential theories as to what this could possibly be? 

What are your thoughts? I would love to hear every ones thoughts and theories regarding the story and if you have any evidence or passages you believe link back to this story!",asoiaf
588,"__TL DR:__ This is a long analysis arguing that the convoluted plot about Stannis gaining the support of the Manderlys in the north was intended as parallel to fAegon gaining the support of the Martells in the south. This supports the idea that fAegon will gain the support of the Martells only after a convoluted and long process. There won’t be an easy shortcut to victory for neither Stannis nor fAegon.

###Intro

From 2001 to 2005 (roughly), GRRM wrote AFfC as a single book covering all the POVs. Only after he passed the size limit of a physically possible book binding, he decided to split the manuscript and this is how we ended up getting the split material between AFfC and ADwD. GRRM later commented about one of the downsides of this split:

[SSM](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/2267)

&gt; FEBRUARY 25, 2007

&gt; Cersei and Daenerys are intended as parallel characters --each exploring a different approach to how a woman would rule in a male dominated, medieval-inspired fantasy world.

Due to the split, the readers could not read about this intended parallel within the same book simultaneously. I think another parallel situation that was intended is the campaign of Stannis in the north and fAegon in the south, which starts in ADwD but had to spill into TWoW for space reasons. The basic premise to keep in mind is as follows:

1. fAegon – Stannis

1. JonCon – Davos

1. Wyman – Doran

We have a pretender using his Hand to gain support from a central power ruled by a seemingly ineffectual and weak but actually cunning and secretly conspiring Lord by fighting against common enemies.

---

Stannis sent his Hand to treat with Manderlys. But Wyman could not act against the Boltons or openly defy the Iron Throne because his heir was still a hostage. He made a public show of executing Davos and this show of loyalty to the Lannisters allowed the safe return of his heir. Later Wyman revealed his secret plans to Davos about overthrowing the Boltons before sending him to a secret mission to bring Rickon back. 

The last we saw Doran, he was very determined that the time for Dorne to openly defy the Iron Throne has not come yet. He was counting on his secret plans about Quentyn bringing Dany and her dragons to Westeros, which is the win condition for him. It was established that Doran would not risk Dorne into a war without a guaranteed the victory. He made a public show of arresting the Sandsnakes, welcoming the retinue of Balon Swann, accepting the skull of Gregor and sending Myrcella back to King’s Landing. Later Doran revealed his secret plans to Arianne and finally the Sandsnakes about bringing the exile Targaryens (Viserys first and now Dany) and overthrowing the Lannisters before sending them to secret missions.

At this moment, fAegon arrives and his Hand sends a letter to Doran, asking his support and recognition. Doran secretly sends Arianne to assess the situation, and specifically find out whether Dany and Quentyn are with them or not. In ADwD, Doran was hopeful that Quentyn and Dany might have sailed with these arrivals, hiding the dragons in the ships. But in TWoW Arianne chapters, Doran is worried that Quentyn and Dany might not be with the mercenaries because there is no word from them. 

Doran schooled Arianne in the Queenmaker plot and now she knows better in his eyes. Hence, Doran gave Arianne the authority to make this momentous decision to reject or join these mercenaries. But regardless of the credibility of fAegon’s survival tale, how can Doran side with mercenaries without Dany’s dragons in the equation? As a result, being worried that Dany and Quentyn are not coming in the foreseeable future, I think Doran must have sent secret orders to the Dornish hosts that if Arianne commands them to ride to war, they will not obey her. He should be trusting Arianne to make the reasonable choice that without a guaranteed victory, Dorne should not be dragged into an adventure that might destroy it. He might not be aware of the extent of Arianne’s ambitions, no more than Arianne herself, but this diplomatic mission and Arianne’s choice will become yet another test for Arianne in the eyes of Doran.

JonCon’s case here is similar to Davos at the Merman’s Court. He is trying to convince Dorne to openly defy the Iron Throne and declare for them. He knows that without Dany and the dragons, he has little chance to win important Lords to his cause. Just like Davos could not produce any proof for the illegitimacy of Tommen when asked in the Merman’s Court, JonCon lacks solid proofs to convince Arianne that fAegon is the real deal. Davos knew that his case was very weak from the start. Stannis was in desperate need of the Manderlys; not vice versa. When Wyman openly asked Davos about what Stannis offered to the Manderlys in return of their allegiance, Davos could only call it a chance to do their duty. But Ser Marlon said the unsaid part and pointed that Stannis offers them only defeat and death.

Under these circumstances, either with Arianne acting rationally or Doran overruling her rash decisions, Dorne will not join fAegon right on the spot. They will play their hands carefully by keeping their involvement with the mercenaries at utmost secrecy and they will want to see some promise of victory in Team fAegon before acting. Remember, this is no joke. When Davos asked Lord Wyman what he would do if a Frey found out that another person was executed instead of Davos, he sincerely replied that in that case, he would have blamed the gaoler and this time really executed Davos. At that time, his son was a hostage and Lord Wyman would never condemn his heir to death. The whole secret plot with Davos is being done under the terms of Lord Wyman and he still keeps plausible deniability if something goes wrong and the Boltons/Lannisters prove victor.

Another thing to show how careful Lord Wyman playing his hand is that he asked Davos to bring his liege lord back so that he would take Stannis Baratheon as his king. This is a clever deception because his liege lord is Bran as confirmed to have survived the Sack just like Rickon. Depending on the circumstances, even if Davos successfully brings Rickon back and the Boltons are defeated, Wyman can still use this loophole to avoid fully committing to Stannis. The agreement was about his liege lord but unless Bran is brought back or his death is confirmed, Rickon can’t be the liege lord. 

Returning to Dorne, they too will want to have the upper hand in the deal with fAegon. They will not want to risk being associated with fAegon in case he fails against the Lannisters but even in a temporary victory, they will want to keep their involvement secret to maintain plausible deniability. They will want to see certain milestone victories before committing to fAegon’s cause. In addition to that, they will require highly valuable rewards in return for their allegiance; something comparable to Lord Wyman demanding the boy Lord to be handed to his custody.

###Conclusion

This analysis is meant to address two flaws in the fandom’s thought process regarding Dorne and fAegon:

1. The first one is that Arianne will join fAegon on the spot and lend the Dornish armies to his service right away. The fandom correctly interprets the clues and predicts that Dorne will join fAegon against Dany. But the manner and the timing cannot be so quick because it would hurt and distort the fabric of the world. When we have things happening conveniently and characters acting irrationally in a way to further the plot in a blazing speed, the whole thing becomes GoT, not ASOIAF. If GRRM presents everything to fAegon on a silver platter in such a quick succession, then we should complain about the execution just like we did with the show.

1. The second one is that fAegon does not have to offer Dorne a hefty reward for their allegiance because being half Martell, he is entitled to it. This is not how things work in Westeros. Just like Lord Wyman, the Martells are in the position of power and they will not move an inch if fAegon cannot reward them according to their station. That is unless fAegon marries Dany. In that case, the Targaryen couple becomes so strong that Dorne would not have any power to dictate terms. But we know that fAegon and Dany will be enemies, in which case fAegon’s hand of marriage is too big a prize to let others have it.",asoiaf
589,"Since we know the general ending from the show, I’m wondering what happens to House Lannister since Tyrion is the only surviving child of Tywin and he’s the hand of the king. Is there even a House left? My thought is that it will pass to a coy sub or perhaps Tywin’s sisters kids.",asoiaf
590,"One aspect of the Azor Ahai myth involves ""waking dragons from stone"" or ""waking the stone dragon"". Various characters are associated with these creatures, including Daenerys, Aegon VI and/or Jon Connington, Aegon V Melisandre, Stannis, Edric Storm, and Shireen. I propose that **Jon Snow will be an aspect of the Stone Dragon**, if not *the* Stone Dragon; he will be resurrected when Melisandre burns Shireen. Along with her life force, **he will also acquire the supernatural plague of Greyscale** which Shireen carries.

# Daenerys:

&gt;Irri fetched the egg with the deep green shell, bronze flecks shining amid its scales as she turned it in her small hands. Dany curled up on her side, pulling the sandsilk cloak across her and cradling the egg in the hollow between her swollen belly and small, tender breasts. She liked to hold them. They were so beautiful, and sometimes just being close to them made her feel stronger, braver, as if somehow she were drawing strength from the **stone dragons locked inside.**

(AGOT Daenerys IV)

Of course, Dany is a candidate for Azor Ahai

# Aegon VI/Jon Connington:

&gt;A cloth dragon swayed on poles amidst a cheering crowd. From a smoking tower, a great stone beast took wing, breathing shadow fire.

(ACOK Daenerys IV)

Aegon might be one of the three heads of the Dragon. However it is also likely that the stone beast is a Griffin (Connington's sigil, a winged creature), and shadow fire refers to Blackfyre.

# Aegon V alias Egg:

&gt;Dunk fell in beside him. Crakehall's long cloak flapped behind him with every gust of wind, as white as moonlight on snow. The sight of it made him think back on the words the Fiddler had spoken, up on the roof. I dreamed that you were all in white from head to heel, with a long pale cloak flowing from those broad shoulders. Dunk snorted. Aye, and you dreamed of **dragons hatching from stone** eggs. One is likely as t'other.

(The Mystery Knight)

Here, a Stone Dragon is a Targaryen.

# Melisandre/Stannis/Edric Storm:

Melisandre is obviously obsessed with waking the Stone Dragon.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ser Axell went to one knee. ""On bended knee I beg you, sire. **Wake the stone dragon** and let the traitors tremble. Like Aegon you begin as Lord of Dragonstone. Like Aegon you shall conquer. Let the false and the fickle feel your flames.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""I am a small man,"" Davos admitted, ""so tell me why you need this boy Edric Storm to **wake your great stone** **dragon**, my lady."" He was determined to say the boy's name as often as he could.

(ASOS Davos V)

# Shireen

&gt;""I had bad dreams,"" Shireen told him. ""**About the dragons. They were coming to eat me.""**  
&gt;  
&gt;The child had been plagued by nightmares as far back as Maester Cressen could recall. ""We have talked of this before,"" he said gently. ""**The dragons cannot come to life. They are carved of stone, child.** In olden days, our island was the westernmost outpost of the great Freehold of Valyria. It was the Valyrians who raised this citadel, and they had ways of shaping stone since lost to us. A castle must have towers wherever two walls meet at an angle, for defense. The Valyrians fashioned these towers in the shape of dragons to make their fortress seem more fearsome, just as they crowned their walls with a thousand gargoyles instead of simple crenellations."" He took her small pink hand in his own frail spotted one and gave it a gentle squeeze. **""So you see, there is nothing to fear.""**

(ACOK Prologue)

Unfortunately, she has everything to fear.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""The maesters say greyscale is not—""  
&gt;  
&gt;""The maesters may believe what they wish. Ask a woods witch if you would know the truth. The grey death sleeps, only to wake again. **The child is not clean**!""  
&gt;  
&gt;""She seems a sweet girl. You cannot know—""  
&gt;  
&gt;""I can. You know nothing, Jon Snow."" Val seized his arm. ""I want the monster out of there. Him and his wet nurses. **You cannot leave them in that same tower as the dead girl**.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Jon shook her hand away. ""She is not dead.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""She is. **Her mother cannot see it. Nor you, it seems. Yet death is there.**"" She walked away from him, stopped, turned back. ""I brought you Tormund Giantsbane. Bring me my monster.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""If I can, I will.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Do. You owe me a debt, Jon Snow.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Jon watched her stride away. She is wrong. She must be wrong. **Greyscale is not so deadly as she claims, not in children.**

(ADWD Jon XI)

Val knows that Shireen is unclean.

# Garin

&gt;""The conquerors did not believe either, Hugor Hill,"" said Ysilla. ""The men of Volantis and Valyria hung Garin in a golden cage and made mock as he called upon his Mother to destroy them. But in the night the waters rose and drowned them, and from that day to this they have not rested. They are down there still beneath the water, they who were once the lords of fire. Their cold breath rises from the murk to make these fogs, and their flesh has turned as stony as their hearts.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""The Bridge of Dream,"" Griff named it. ""There will be stone men on the span. Some may start to wail at our approach, but they are not like to molest us. Most stone men are feeble creatures, clumsy, lumbering, witless. **Near the end they all go mad**, but that is when they are most dangerous. If need be, fend them off with the torches. On no account let them touch you.""

(ADWD Tyrion V)

Greyscale is a supernatural curse that was intended to be used against the *dragonlords*. The *Targaryens*.

# Jon

&gt;Yet now she could not even seem to find her king. **I pray for a glimpse of Azor Ahai, and R'hllor shows me only Snow**. ""Devan,"" she called, ""a drink."" Her throat was raw and parched.

(ADWD Melisandre)

Jon Snow is Azor Ahai, not Stannis.

# GRRM on Resurrection

Here, I cite an interview in which GRRM discusses LOTR ***(Spoilers ahead)***.

&gt;Yeah, maybe. That may have been part of it. Part of it was also, it’s the dialogue that I was talking about. And here I’ve got to get back to Tolkien again. And I’m going to seem like I’m criticizing him, which I guess I am. **It’s always bothered me that Gandalf comes back from the dead.** The Red Wedding for me in Lord of the Rings is the mines of Moria, and when Gandalf falls — it’s a devastating moment! I didn’t see it coming at 13 years old, it just totally took me by surprise. Gandalf can’t die! He’s the guy that knows all of the things that are happening! He’s one of the main heroes here! Oh god, what are they going to do without Gandalf? Now it’s just the hobbits?! And Boromir, and Aragorn? Well, maybe Aragorn will do, but it’s just a huge moment. A huge emotional investment.  
&gt;  
&gt;And then in the next book, he shows up again, and it was six months between the American publications of those books, which seemed like a million years to me. So all that time I thought Gandalf was dead, and now he’s back and now he’s Gandalf the White. **And, ehh, he’s more or less the same as always, except he’s more powerful. It always felt a little bit like a cheat to me. And as I got older and considered it more, it also seemed to me that death doesn’t make you more powerful. That’s, in some ways, me talking to Tolkien in the dialogue, saying, “Yeah, if someone comes back from being dead, especially if they suffer a violent, traumatic death, they’re not going to come back as nice as ever.”** That’s what I was trying to do, and am still trying to do, with the Lady Stoneheart character.

# Awakening the Stone Dragon

As of the the end of *ADWD*, Melisandre has received (probably false) information that Stannis, who she believed to be Azor Ahai is dead. She will try to sacrifice Shireen to raise him. (or she could be sacrificed under different circumstances, it is the sacrifice that is important). Of course, Stannis is not Azor Ahai, but the true Azor Ahai, Jon, lies died.

Under normal circumstances, resurrection damages a person mentally. Beric lost his memory and Stoneheart become mad. However, Jon will not suffer this as he has access to Ghost. It is commonly discussed that he will avoid the mental damage associated with resurrection by warging into Ghost and back into his resurrected body. (see [this post](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/132616-my-jon-snow-resurrectionwarg-theory/) for example).

However, resurrection must come at some terrible cost, especially because Jon is such a crucial character. I believe that when Shireen is burnt, her taint, Garin's curse will jump from her body to the Dragonlord. Jon will be mentally intact but will suffer terrible physical damage. He will awake with generalized whole body greyscale. He will cause a plague at the Wall and maybe the entire North. **He will rise as a Great Stone Dragon.**",asoiaf
591,"So. I'm really glad they're making a prequel. I'm looking forward to it greatly! I hope having fresh directors, cast and crew will re-ignite my passion for the show, in the same way I love the books. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I just can't help but feel a little underwhelmed with their choice of prequel setting. Maybe it's because I don't take the Walkers seriously after S8. Maybe it's because I just don't have faith that it will be well made. I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

What are all your thoughts? Am I crazy?",asoiaf
592,"To keep it brief,

we all know what happened to the tyrells at the end of GoT and most notably who was told to govern and administrate the reach afterwards.

Now, if we look away from Bronn, who would be a more...reasonable Lord of the reach?

Perhaps House Hightower?",asoiaf
593,"It really intrigues me knowing GRRM's insight as to what he would change if he had the option of doing it over again. The height of the Wall, Tyrion's fighting skills, the age of the characters are some of the ones I already know about. And that he initially wrote Slynt to be hanged by Jon Snow rather than beheaded and changed it after fans requested him. Also there are days he wished he wrote 5 Kingdoms instead of 7.

What are some of the other well known or lesser known changes George said he would have liked to make? Or did make throughout writing the books(like Janos hanging)?

And finally there are things from the show that will have him making some minor changes in the future books. For example, he really liked the character Ros from the show and said that she may show up in the future books. And given how the actress who played Osha portrayed the character, he will now make her more intriguing in the future books.",asoiaf
594,"Many people have pointed that show-only viewers were frequently confused about character names, families and relationships. That's one argument for why certain characters had to be cut. This is an inevitable consequence of having such a huge cast, however, I think this problem could have been a little reduced.

&amp;#x200B;

In the books - at least in my country's version - there are two ""appendixes"" - the maps on the very first pages of every book and the character lists and descriptions on the very last pages.

&amp;#x200B;

The show was inspired by the first ""appendix"" (the maps) to create the opening sequence. Imagine, however, that it also had an ending sequence inspired by the second ""appendix"" (the character lists). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of something very simple - an animation featuring the family trees of 3 or 4 houses per episode (just like the opening sequence only showed a few locations per episode -usually the most relevant to that episode - this ending sequence would only show a few family trees each time). 

&amp;#x200B;

These family trees could be very simple: only the photo of the character's face and their name below. Dead characters could have a black-and-white photo, or maybe the photo would be ripped/crossed. Characters that we never met (Lyanna or Rhaegar, for instance, or Euron before he was introduced) would have no photo (maybe just their house sigil in the place of the photo, for example). 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, family trees could change over time - Jon would first be shown in the Stark family tree, as a son of Eddard and an unnamed character marked with a ""?"", but later he'd be shown in the Targaryen family tree, as a son of Rhaegar and Lyanna Stark.  Also, these family trees didn't need to be 100% complete - for instance, the Stark family tree would include Eddard, Lyanna and Benjen, but not their parents or their elder brother Brandon. The Lannister family tree wouldn't show Tywin or Kevan in the beginning - they'd only show up after they first appeared.

&amp;#x200B;

If a new ASOIAF adaption is ever made - be it live action or animation - I think it will be better if it has something like this. What do you think?",asoiaf
595,"From ASOS...
“Gendry rode out from behind the cottage wall, and behind him Hot Pie, leading her horse. In his chainmail shirt with a sword in his hand, Gendry looked almost a man grown, and dangerous. ***Hot Pie looked like Hot Pie.”***",asoiaf
596,"During the last chapter of Jaime in AFFC, he has this weird and unusual dream. I really wanted di talk about it, I'm reading the books for the First time And I've just arrived to Jaime's chapter in ADWD. I hope some of you guys can answer some of my questions about this and discuss about some theories. 

So, in this ""dream"" Jaime apparently meets his mother Joanna. (I guess she is, I couldn't think to anyone else). 

Joanna points out that this is not an usual dream, because Jaime has only one hand and in his dreams he usually have both his hands. (so GRRM wants us to think that this is not a normal dream, maybe it's something more?) 

Then there is this line from Joanna:
""We all dream things we cannot have, Tywin dream that his son would be a great night and that his daughter would be a queen"" 
Jaime points out that he is a knight and Cersei is a queen. 
And then: ""A tear rolled down her cheek"". 
Joanna went away crying. Why she does that? 

Here are two thoughts I've about this

1)Joanna Cryes because Jaime is a Knight that has lost his Honour and Cersei is a fallen/mad queen. 

2)Joanna Cryes because Jaime and Cersei are NOT Tywin children. 

Following the second thought we get to the conclusion that Jaime and Cersei are sons of Aerys Targaryen. Could it be? It surely be a lot ironic because if it's so:

-Jaime actually killed his own father

-Tyrion is actually Tywin's only son

-Targaryens ususally do incest. Well... Hello Jaime and Cersei

-Cersei actually resembles Aerys in his behavior (she used wildfire , and Jaime says that that fire makes her even more beautiful) 

Also:

- In this book, Jenna (Jaime's hunt) says to Jaime that the real son of Tywin is Tyrion. Of course she implies that Tyrion is more similar to Tywin than Jaime and Cersei but this still let me think that Jaime and Cersei have a very different behavior compared to Tywin. 

-In this dream Joanna says to jaime ""Lord Tywin"" and not ""your father"". When she says ""lord your father"" she doesn't say Tywin's name. She also asked him ""did you truly know your father"" and ""Who are you"". 

So, could this actually be true? I wanted to hear your opinions. 

What is the real point of this dream? Why does Martin showed us this? What is this if not a dream? 

In the following chapter (Sam's chapter, wich is the last of this book) Glass candles are introduced. 
Could it be that  Joanna is actually alive somewhere and she uses a glass candle to communicate with Jaime?",asoiaf

- Stannis and Davos going to Braavos to get a loan from the Iron Bank;
- Jaime and Bronn going to Dorne and meeting the Sand Snakes (and their ""bad poosay"");
- Did we really need all those sexposition scenes during the early seasons?

At the very least, Jon VI cannot take place between Eddard XIII and XIV, considering that it takes place over the course of a day while those two are spread out over a single night and morning.)

So what happens if any number of events conspire to delay Jon's taking his vows or accelerate Robert's death? Does Jon join the Watch anyway? Does he leave (legally) and join Robb? If so, does he stay at Winterfell and eventually prevent Theon from taking it, or accompany Robb in his campaign? Is he killed at the Red Wedding? Hell, is there a Red Wedding?

Which plays into the whole manipulation for the throne speculation. Which is hard to say for certain because aside from these visions and 3ER focus on Jon, we do not have any other insight into the 3ER thoughts, motives etc.

I feel if what was uncovered in the cave was more than just visions about R + L = J, we would have better insight into the entire storyline and journey of the 3ER.

Do you think d&amp;d just used bran as a way to uncover R + L = J, which resulted in us to believing his master plan was to gain the throne all along?

It seems plausible that Jons heritage could come out via howland reed in the books and have nothing to do with Bran. Thus changing out entire perception of the 3ER.

What do you guys think, D&amp;D just couldn't come up with a better way to reveal Jon's parentage than Bran. Which resulted in the missed opportunity of diving deeper into the history and motive of the 3ER? Or do you feel It will go down the same way in the books?",asoiaf
604,"It makes no sense that this house has not been utterly destroyed like the Reynes/Tarbecks.

1. When Barba Bracken committed treason, she and her newborn bastard son Bittersteel were banned from court.
2. Melissa Blackwood then became Aegon the Unworthy's longest reigning mistress because everyone at court loved her. Aegon the Unworthy stripped the Brackens of some of their lands and gave those lands to the Blackwoods when it was rumored that Barba said Melissa was ""flat as a boy"" while sulking at Stone Hedge.
3. Aegon the Unworthy randomly decides to visit his young son Bittersteel. I don't know why. He becomes infatuated with Barba's sister Bethany and brings her back to court. Bethany then cheats on him and Aegon has her brutally murdered along with her father. Bethany's lover's family then kills the most beloved knight ever Aemon the Dragonknight.
4. Then comes near 70 years of Blackfyre rebellions, which House Bracken, of course, supports because they are lead by a Bracken bastard. They lose every rebellion!
5. Betha Blackwood becomes queen consort to Aegon V and obviously Betha would disfavor the Brackens in favor of her kin. With her being queen, she could have that house completely demolished and House Tully would favor the Blackwoods due to their relation to the queen.
6. Similar to the Peakes which are barely a house in the present, every Bracken is written as a villain, even down to the mistresses such as Barba and Bethany. The Peakes are barely a footnote, but somehow the Brackens live on as a secondary house. It makes no sense.

605,"Something is really fishy here.

The official story is that Lord Denys Darklyn was upset about his province losing money due to close proximity to King's Landing, so he requests a special charter like Dorne received hundreds of years prior. Tywin denies the request, Denys invites Aerys to negotiate, Tywin advises him not to go, Aerys goes because he's the OG not Tywin, Denys captures Aerys, Barristan infiltrates the Dun Fort and rescues Aerys, then Aerys exterminates the Darklyn's, and a bunch of others save for only Dontos Hollard.

The small folk like to say that Denys' Myrish wife, Lady Serala bewitched him and made him do it. All of this brings up many issues with what Denys' actual goal was.

I have a lot of questions, but first I'd like to know, is this period of time covered in *Fire and Blood* or the World Book?

607,"After thinking about it I have realised that the ending of Game if Thrones really is bittersweet. Because it may seem like it’s a happy ending. But in reality there will just be more war and suffering. These are the main reasons.

•”Choosing” a king will lead to more war

•”Crops in the Riverlands and the North are none existent.

•Bronn is Lord of the Reach (and master of coin)

•Dorne and the Iron Islands leave and they can’t be stopped 

•Bran is connected to the Old gods

First of the part of the mightiest Nobels choosing a king is just stupid. The war of the five Kings was in short about lineage (The Dance if the dragons as well). So removing the rights of inheritance will lead to more power struggle.

Second both the war and the winter have left the North (now independent) without any food as well as the Riverlands. So famine.

Now Bronn won’t be accepted as  Lord paramount of the Reach. He is an up jumped sellsword who the Hightower’s (now the Lords of the biggest city in Westeros) will never accept. This will lead to rebellion. Also Bronn is master of coin and knows nothing about economy.

Now Dorne and the Irons Islands will leave as well. And King Brann the broken can’t do shit about it. Dorne hasn’t really lost any troops during the entire series. While the Riverlands are ashes, and the Westerland, Crownland and the Stormlands are also stretched thin. Only the Vale and the Reach can really raise an army. But Dorne couldn’t even be conquered by dragons so I don’t know how they hope to do that. Also it would be an two front war against the Iron Islands as well. Even if the Iron fleet is mainly gone so is the Royal one. Only Redwine fleet remains, and they won’t be taking orders from “Lord” Bronn.

And lastly, Bran is connected with the Old gods. And for anyone who knows anything about Westerosi history they know this only means one thing. Religious uprising.

So in conclusion Brann would use the first years of his reign fighting an impossible two front war while one of his own kingdoms would rebel against their Lord Paramount. He would also experience wide spread famine as well as an uprising from the Faith. I give him a year max.",asoiaf

610,"[A couple years ago I wrote a post explaining why I think Young Griff will actually be critical to the endgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/6vfqzg/spoilers_main_daenerys_is_eating_tyrions/), a position that's found wide acceptance lately- but armed with the proactive hindsight of the show's ending, there's another controversial plot element I believe will be equally important for her development. 

The Meereenese knot. Understandably, it's been drastically scaled down for TV, but I think that like Griff, this shoots the story in the foot. It's a confusing disaster on purpose. I think we've already seen the beginning of the end in ADWD.

The Meereenese knot serves a vital plot purpose for Dany, because it's just as much of an inscrutable pain in the ass for her as it is for us. She's a pov for a reason, and we're getting every bit of her confusion and difficulty handling all of this. And realistically, there's simply no way she'll be able to come out of the Meereen experience achieving her goals AND remaining faithful to her ideals. One of them is going to have to give way. She's an outsider who the people don't universally accept, she's had all of like six months tops to learn the ins and outs of this city, she's imposing a diametrically contrary moral order on the entire culture, and throwing the class structure on it's head, stirring a several thousand year old hornet's nest. She's made a huge mess of this, and it would require a truly special political operator with a lot of time on their hands to sort it out. 

We've already seen her decide how she's going to handle it- she simply left. Instead of resolving to find solutions that cleave to her morals, she flies away to shit herself and make hats. This leads her to rediscover her Dothraki 'roots', which leads to her rediscovering the cognitive dissonance seesaw at the heart of her character- **An innate will to be good vs her adopted Dothraki cultural morality**. With her youthful naivety as the fulcrum. For someone who fancies themselves a liberator and wants to serve as a moral beacon to the world, shagging up with the Dothraki and learning from them as an apprentice is a very strange decision. Before Drogo, she seemingly didn't have much of a personality or an anchor in the world, so she latched on to the culture that raised her up and made her a queen despite the fact that they are, by modern and by her standards, an utterly reprehensible people who defy everything she tells herself she believes. The fact that she's the breaker of chains AND the Khaleesi of the great grass sea is a ridiculous oxymoron. 

The show actually got the Dothraki part, but they let the rest of her character slip through their fingers, partially by ACTUALLY making her the feminist goddess that she was never quite intended to be written as- that's simply how she views herself, and every narrator in ASOIAF is an unreliable narrator, except for Hotah. In reality, she's a young, impressionable teen learning the world as shes goes. She has the pure and good heart of a child but is being slowly corrupted by the world around her- the entitlement of her brother rubbed off on her since he's the foundation that her character is built on, murderous sellswords, rampaging Dothraki, slaver lords, these people don't care about doing the right thing. And in the face of a problem she can't possibly hope to solve doing the right thing- the Meereenese knot- she'll do the same thing all the rest of them do; the easy thing. This is also on the seesaw of her character, the right way vs the easy way- being evil, hedonistic and solving problems through violence and strength is easy. But being good, solving problems with tact, empathy, and compromise is incredibly difficult. And she has the easiest way of them all, no matter how bad her situation gets, she always has a door number 3 that pretty much leads to her automatic win. 




What her character seems to represent is the juxtaposition of someone with an anachronistically modern sense of morality dropped into a world drunk on war. A child, which is very important- Dany going evil is not going to be some nonsensical heel turn for shock value, it's going to be a malleable young person falling victim to the social mores of the world she's trying to improve. This was pretty much set in stone the moment she embraced the Dothraki. Of course she had little choice, it wasn't exactly her idea, which is a message in it's own right. But the fact that she can't see these people for what they are, she can't see that they have no place in her new world, it says it all. She wanted nothing more than to be the mother of the Stallion Who Mounts the World, I'll give you three guesses how that world-mounting would go and what it would mean for the people of that world. She's noble, kind, and genuinely wants the best for the people of the world, but she's a naive young fool who hasn't even considered the possibility that her Dothraki paradise and her ""[beautfiul kingdom filled] with fat men and pretty maids and laughing children"" are purely antithetical to each other. In the latter, the Dothraki wouldn't even exist, and yet she wanted to *use* them as her agents to bring that world about!

This is what her invasion will be. Like a child finally entering adulthood, with all their silly delusions about it coming crashing down immediately. All this time Dany's idea of being queen is a fantasy of abstract ideals that she never has to confront realistically, because it's all in her head. The slaughter of King's Landing won't be a sudden inexplicable decision, it'll be the ultimate consequence of her childish inability to assess her own mindset, her subtle moral degeneration under the Dothraki, and her pattern of making decisions to burn her way out of tough situations instead of using politics- taking the easy route. Looking at this in retrospect, it won't be baffling and sudden, it will make us realize that this was inevitable and it was the only way things could have possibly panned out based on the circumstances and the development of her character. This is an anti war story, and Danaerys' arc will reflect that, a young and purely good person succumbing to her inner evil without even realizing it because she becomes desensitized to the inherent immorality of violence.",asoiaf
611,"The first time I read the series, I readily sympathized with the Stark view on tournaments, that it was foolish to seek glory in a make-believe battle. But now I am thinking this is northern snobbery, that it's not a terrible thing to allow ambitious, martial men to make a name for themselves during times of peace. Good way to blow off some steam, rather than these same men provoke a war to attain said glory [footnote 1]. Or maybe all the peacetime glory they need can be found in the practice yard. I'm sure Braavos would have more men to call upon if the bravos took up nonlethal fencing.

Perhaps the best way to test this is to compare the amount of fighting within the North vs the other 6 kingdoms preconquest. I couldn't easily decide that, and when I factored in the coin, networking, and happy smallfolk that a tourney brings to a town,  well, call me Jaime Lannister, but I say Ned oughta get off his high horse. 

1. I was going to use the example of those who flocked to Renly's Banner to fight Stannis, but then I remembered they were in the middle of a tourney when Catelyn finds them lol",asoiaf
612,"Ask anybody who has only watched the TV Show about the two main character traits that Jon has. I'm almost certain all of them will say: ""Well he's a good, honorable guy; and he knows nothing!"" Well I'm sorry to tell you that's not faithful to the books and is the main reason why ShowJon is so ridiculously *booring*.
  
I won't get into him being ""good"". In one sentence: he does aim to do the right thing, but is clouded by arrogance, ignorance, and some bias towards the wildlings.
  
The more important thing though. In A Clash of Kings, Ygritte and Jon hook up, and Ygritte has the signature line that she chides Jon with: ""You know nothing, Jon Snow"". The TV Show adapted this line, and this line only, and maybe only sometimes added some context to it. But in the books, this line is used over and over again **solely** for the purpose of lecturing Jon about the history of the wildlings, even to such an extent where Ygritte spills the beans that they never found the Horn of Joramun. The sentence isn't ""You know nothing, Jon Snow""; but ""You know nothing about the free folk, we are more than just savages, we have a rich history and we deserve safety from the Others as well, Jon Snow"". Which is absolutely what drives Jon in A Dance With Dragons to make as many political moves as possible to save the free folk from imminent death and to help integrate them into the North.
  
The TV Show bastardized the line, and the character with it. They have made Jon stupid, intentionally. He doesn't have any good ideas as Lord Commander, and also clearly fails massively as a military commander after that as well. They forgot to add the nuances to the character so they tried to make him gray by making him dumb. I don't know about you guys but it made Jon such an insultingly boring character throughout pretty much the entire series. In the first couple of seasons it was bearable, but got boring pretty quick.",asoiaf

614,"Reading through the asoiaf wiki page of Euron, due to the iron born have somewhat of a viking theme, some characteristics made me associate him with Odin.  

&gt; Euron's personal coat-of-arms is a red eye with a black pupil beneath a black iron crown supported by **two crows.** 

In legends Odin has **two ravens** (yeah that could debunk my theory).

&gt;The crow is the raven's poor cousin. They are both beggars in black, hated and misunterstood.        
\--Aemon to Jon

In the real world, ravens are often associated with wisdom and more positivity, whereas the crow is sorrounded by omens and ill signs. Swapping the symbolism could work for Euron, as in the World of Ice and Fire, Crows and Ravens are similiarily distinguished.

  
The two ravens Hugin and Munin tell Odin everything they saw or heard.   
However, Euron does not seem accompanied by crows or ravens. I thought of three possibilities:  
1. The crows simply style his coat-of-arms (or of a reason not linked to this theory)  
2. The crows are portrayed by humans like members of the Night's Watch are sometimes referred as crows.  
3. He does (at least have) crows that work for him, but are not arround the few times he appeared in the book.

&gt;It was the singers who taught the First Men to send messages by raven... but in those days, the birds would speak the words. The trees remember, but men forget, and so now they write the messages on parchment and tie them round the feet of birds who have never shared their skin.  
\--Lord Brynden to Bran Stark

It seems there once was a ability to mimic Odin's powers (if it does work with ravens it should with crows too). Ravens and crows seem to have somewhat of an intelligence, so maybe they scout the world and tell Euron of what he needs to know, or he wargs into them  and flies where he desires.   
So, do we know where they are and have we seen them? No, and maybe yes: 

&gt; He wears a patch over his left eye, and is nicknamed Crow's Eye. According to Euron's nephew, Theon Greyjoy, the patch conceals a ""**black eye shining with malice**"" 

Odin gave one of his eyes to Mimir in trade for wisdom. It does not seem clear which one, but of what I have seen, most depict it as the left one. Euron shares that feature. (if presumed the black eye Euron hass not really an eye, or at least not his original, but a magical one. Or a magical object as Symeon Star- Eyes put saphires into his eye sockets. But most importantly, his black eye shares a characteristic with another character of the series:

&gt; When Bran Stark is in a coma after his fall, a crow appears in his dreams and tells Bran it can teach him to fly. Bran realizes it has three eyes, with the third eye **full of a terrible knowledge**.  

Euron does not have a third eye, but maybe he sees what the three eyed crow sees through its third eye. Maybe Euron traded his eye for this power. His Nickname ""Crow's Eye"" could be literally a crow's eye, or stating that there is some sort of a link to one.

&gt;""Are you the three-eyed crow?"" Bran heard himself say. ""A... crow? Once, aye. Black of garb and black of Blood.""

Bloodraven has watched Bran his whole life, but does not identify himself as the three-eyed crow but the Night's Watch instead. So there seems to be a misconception.

So, what to make of this theory? I really don't know. There are not much facts about him and most of them seem to point a different direction. I collected of what seems to fit together.   
So proof my point, debunk it or just add what you see in Euron's symbolism and future plans. I am very interested in his character,so I want to get behind this mystery that is sorrounding him. 

But, here is final quote, that should draw another connection between Euron and the three eyed crow, whether he is it or was visited by it:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""When I was a boy, I dreamt that I could fly"" \[Euron\] announced. ""When I woke, I couldn't... or so the maester said. But what if he lied?"" --Euron to Victarion",asoiaf

616,"This is all going to be pretty speculative and theoretical, but I want to reconsider how Sansa's book arc is set to play out based on what we have seen from the show.

# Sansa won't be Queen in the North

First off, I do not believe that Sansa is actually going to end the story as Queen in the North in the books. I know that a lot of people really love Sansa and really loved this ending for her, but I just don't see this in the cards at all. It makes so little sense that it's more likely something D&amp;D tweaked about the ending in order to give Sansa a sort of ""huzzah"" moment at the end, particularly due to how much they like the character, and the need they likely felt to depict that a strong woman did indeed end up in power at the end.

But if Bran Stark is made the King of the rest of the Kingdoms (which he will be), then it makes no sense that the North would secede and take away Bran's base of support. The North didn't want to be independent, they wanted to be ruled by one of their own, which is achieved through King Brandon Stark. While the show spends several seasons with Sansa at Winterfell, in the books there is no great loyalty to Sansa herself, and there would be no reason for the Northerners to abandon Bran for her. Furthermore, Robb establishes the precedent of ""King of the North and the Riverlands"" due to the Stark children being Tullys through Catelyn, so that further drives the point that whoever rules the Riverlands at the end, will also rule the North. Not to mention that Robb's crown is currently in the possession of Lady Stoneheart, and it just makes far more sense that Bran will wear that crown at the end of the story than that Sansa will.

So what is Sansa's ending then? well...

Where we currently have Sansa in the books, she resides at the Vale under the alias of Alayne Stone, playing a pawn in Littlefinger's mysterious scheme. According to LF, Sansa is supposed to marry Harry the Heir, and then when SweetRobin dies she will become Lady of the Vale, and then Harry will retake WF on her behalf, making Sansa Queen of the North and the Vale.

Whether this is genuinely LF's plan or whether he has something else up his sleeve, I do not believe this plan will come to fruition. The plan has been stated, there is already a huge convergence set to happen WF so Vale politics become somewhat pointless there anyways, Robb's will is set to legitimize Jon as the King in the North, (as we see on the show) Sansa really has nothing to do in the Others storyline but wait it out, narratively speaking Sansa needs to get out from under LF's thumb just as Arya needs to leave the FM, and Harry the Heir feels too minor a character for Sansa to be married to, even if it's ever so briefly before he is mauled to death by wights. Also, I don't think SweetRobin is going to die. All the talk of him dying feels like proof he will survive the story, meaning Harry will never inherit..

I do believe Sansa will eventually make it back to WF, but I think she has to take a detour first.

# Ashford Theory

For those who haven't heard of it, Ashford Theory states that each of Sansa's betrothals are foreshadowed by the 5 champions that end up defending Lady Ashford as Queen of Love and Beauty at the tourney of Ashford. Those champions are: Lyonel Baratheon, Leo Tyrell, Tybolt Lannister, Humfrey Hardying, and Valarr Targaryen.

Similarly, Sansa has been betrothed to Joffrey Baratheon (it's the name that matters, not the blood. Technically Joffrey isn't even a Lannister he's a Waters),  Willas Tyrell, Tyrion Lannister, Harry Hardying, and... if the theory carries forward Sansa could be married to (f)Aegon VI Targaryen (again, name is what matters not legitimacy).

Anyways, Ashford theory is nothing new. It's an amusing theory that people tend to express skepticism of because it involves in some ways abandoning all of the Vale politics established in AFFC and diverting Sansa back south instead of North. Also, because it seems that Arianne Martell is set up to marry fAegon. Which I understand. But at the same time it's hard to argue with the fact that Ser Shadrich the Mad Mouse has been set up with the intent of kidnapping Sansa and taking her back to Varys, which would essentially mean roping Sansa into the Aegon plot. Given Varys' strategy with the fAegon plot of trying to pander to every  part of the realm, a marriage to Sansa Stark actually makes more political sense given fAegon already being (supposedly) half Dornish.

Furthermore, the idea of fAegon setting Arianne aside for Sansa has precedent in Rhaegar setting Elia aside for Lyanna. Besides, having Sansa take the skills she was meant to use to charm Harry the Heir, and instead separate her from LF so she can use them on fAegon to become Queen of the Seven Kingdoms is a more dynamic place to take her story.

Also, Sansa's marriage to Tyrion was never consummated could very easily be annulled by the High Sparrow, who will likely be in (f)Aegon's corner.

While a lot of the details to Ashford theory are controversial (particularly the kidnapping part), I actually think it serves Sansa's arc quite nicely, which is not about becoming a political genius, or directing men into war and battle, or even about her having maximum agency, but more so about how she navigates the limited agency provided to woman in her station. 

But none of that is really a new argument. Here is the new part.

# Lady -&gt; Queen -&gt; Lady

In light of how the show ends, having Sansa married to fAegon has the added narrative benefit of creating tension between Daenerys and the Starks, even if Dany and Sansa never meet. Sansa would not only be the wife of Dany's enemy, but she would potentially be pregnant with a claimant to the Iron Throne. As we saw in the show, the motivation which most pushed Jon to turn on Daenerys was the threat posed to his siblings. Yet while in the show tension between Dany and Sansa is created by having Sansa be outwardly rude and rebellious, book Sansa is learning to use courtesy as her armor. So that would never be an issue.

However, if Sansa was pregnant with fAegon's heir to the Iron Throne, that creates something of an unavoidable conflict.

And in fact, this would match up with the original outline to the story. Originally, Sansa was supposed to get pregnant and give birth to Joffrey's child, which would have made Sansa the mother to a claimant to the Iron Throne (even if that claimant is technically illegitimate).

**TLDR; Essentially, Sansa would become fAegon's Queen, fAegon would die, Sansa would be pregnant with his child, this would make Sansa and her child a threat to Daenerys, Daenerys would die, the Iron Throne would be destroyed, Bran would be made King from Harrenhal, and in the end Sansa would be made Lady of Winterfell with a half Stark half ""Targaryen"" heir.**

Now, alternatively we could see Sansa's marriage to Tyrion end up being the one that sticks seeing as he is Hand of the King in the end. It would make sense given how the War of the Roses ended with a Lancaster and York union. However, this would mean that Tyrion and Sansa would still have to produce and heir, and Sansa would have to leave WF rather than be the last remaining Stark in WF (which the books could resolve w/ Rickon, but his being a Shaggydog story seems more likely to be).

Either way, Sansa ending the story with a dead or absent husband makes the most sense to me personally, but given Sansa needs to carry forward the Stark name, she kind of needs to produce an heir and I don't think the heir to Winterfell will come from a minor character like Harry.

fAegon possible. Tyrion maybe. Littlefinger I fucking hope not.",asoiaf
617,"Firstly Sansa lit the candle in the window and then she seemed to be moving around randomly. Then she climbs up the stairs where she meets Myranda. So had she not met Myranda was Sansa originally planning to jump from the tower to escape to the NW or was she just moving around randomly scared with no escape route?

Secondly how did Theon and Sansa even plan to make it to the Nights Watch? It took Jon and Tyrion 18 days on horseback and that was on the main road. It would take even longer through the countryside and Theon and Sansa don’t have horses. There can’t take the main road because they would be easily caught and Theon just tells Sansa to go North on her own like the distance was nothing and Nights Watch is in the immediate neighbourhood or something. Then he tells her that he would have taken her all the way to the wall. According to what I searched, Winterfell is 600 miles away from the Nights Watch.

620,"What are your thoughts on the future of the Weeper? He’s a minor villain, so he has several options. I will discuss some of them here.

The Weeper is a notorious raider, and is hated by the men of the Night’s Watch and the Northmen.

&gt;The Weeper, he knew at once. The black brothers told tales of this one. Like Rattleshirt and Harma Dogshead and Alfyn Crowkiller, he was a known raider.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;“How many rangers has the Weeper killed?” asked Othell Yarwyck. “How many women has he raped or killed or stolen?” “Three of mine own ilk,” said Old Flint. “And he blinds the girls he does not take.”
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;”All the Weeper knows is rape and murder,” said Yarwyck.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;""The Weeper’s word is worthless,"" said Othell Yarwyck.

The wildlings do not like him, either.

&gt; “You shall have work for your steel soon enough. The enemy is moving, the true enemy. And Lord Snow’s rangers will return before the day is done, with their blind and bloody eyes.” The wildling’s own eyes narrowed. Grey eyes, brown eyes; Melisandre could see the color change with the pulse of the ruby. “Cutting out the eyes, that’s the Weeper’s work. The best crow’s a blind crow, he likes to say. Sometimes I think he’d like to cut out his own eyes, the way they’re always watering and itching. Snow’s been assuming the free folk would turn to Tormund to lead them, because that’s what he would do. He liked Tormund, and the old fraud liked him too. If it’s the Weeper, though…that’s not good. Not for him, and not for us.”
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;”The Weeper will not say the words,” insisted Yarwyck. “He will not wear the cloak. Even other raiders do not trust him.”

The Weeper is currently at large, menacing the Shadow Tower.

&gt;Stannis Baratheon had smashed Mance rayder’s host and made the King-Beyond-the-Wall his captive…but the wildlings were still out there, the Weeper and Tormund Giantsbane and thousands more.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;One day, as they fled, a rider came galloping through the woods on a gaunt white horse, shouting that they all should make for the Milkwater, that the Weeper was gathering warriors to cross the Bridge of Skulls and take the Shadow Tower. Many followed him; more did not.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;“We’ve had a raven from Ser Denys Mallister at the Shadow Tower,” Jon Snow told her. “His men have seen fires in the mountains on the far side of the Gorge. Wildlings massing, Ser Denys believes. He thinks they are going to try to force the Bridge of Skulls again.” “Some may.” Could the skulls in her vision have signified this bridge? Somehow Melisandre did not think so. “If it comes, that attack will be no more than a diversion. I saw towers by the sea, submerged beneath a black and bloody tide. That is where the heaviest blow will fall.”
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;Meanwhile, Ser Denys Mallister was still seeing fires in the night north of the Gorge. Both commanders were asking for more men.

He also may have scouts watching Castle Black.

&gt;”I do not tell men which god to worship. They were free to choose the Seven or the red woman’s Lord of Light. They chose the trees instead, with all the peril that entails.” “**The Weeping Man may still be out there, watching**.” “The grove is no more than two hours’ ride, even with the snow. We should be back by midnight.” “Too long. This is not wise.”
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;“**Could be a hundred of them out there,” said the black brother with the dour face. “Could be a thousand.” “No,” said Jon Snow. “They left their gifts in the black of night, then ran**.” His huge white direwolf prowled around the shafts, sniffing, then lifted his leg and pissed on the spear that held the head of Black Jack Bulwer. “Ghost would have their scent if they were still out there.” “I hope the Weeper burned the bodies,” said the dour man, the once called Dolorous Edd. “Elsewise they might come looking for their heads.” Jon Snow grasped the spear that bore Garth Greyfeather’s head and wrenched it, violently from the ground. “Pull down the other two,” he commanded, and four of the crows turned to obey.

After letting Tormund through the Wall, Jon considers making peace with the Weeper as well. This contributes to Marsh and Yarwyck turning against him.

&gt;At the Bridge of Skulls he had met the Weeper and three hundred wildlings and won a bloody battle. But the victory had been a costly one. More than a hundred brothers slain, among them Ser Endrew Tarth and Ser Aladale Wynch. The Old Pomegranate himself had been carried back to the Shadow Tower sorely wounded. Maester Mullin was tending him, but it would be some time before he was fit to return to Castle Black.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;Bowen Marsh edged his mount up next to Jon’s. “This is a day I never thought to see.” The Lord Steward had thinned notably since suffering a head wound at the Bridge of Skulls. Part of one ear was gone. *He no longer looks like a pomegranate*, Jon thought. Marsh said, “**We bled to stop the wildlings at the Gorge. Good men were slain there, friends and brothers. For what?**”
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;The Old Pomegranate touched his scar. He had gotten it defending the Bridge of Skulls the last time the Weeping Man had tried to cut his way across the Gorge. “Surely the lord commander cannot mean to allow that…that demon through as well?” “Not gladly.” Jon had not forgotten the heads the Weeping Man had left him, with bloody holes where their eyes had been. Black Jack Bulwer, Hairy Hal, Garth Greyfeather. I cannot avenge them, but I will not forget their names. “But yes, my lord, him as well. We cannot pick and choose amongst the free folk, saying this one may pass, this one may not. Peace means peace for all.”
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;”Tormund has given me his oath. He will serve with us until the spring. The Weeper and the other captains will swear the same or we will not let them pass.” Old Flint shook his head. “ They will betray us.” “The Weeper’s word is worthless,” said Othell Yarwyck. “These are godless savages,” said Septon Cellador. “Even in the south the treachery of wildlings is renowned.” … “The gods of the North, since before this Wall was raised,” said Jon. “Those are the gods that Tormund swore by. He will keep his word. I know him, as I knew Mance Rayder. **I marched with them for a time, you may recall.” “I had not forgotten,” said the Lord Steward**.

So, what could happen to the Weeper in the future?

**He Dies**

The Weeper and his men may be killed by the Others. It looks like the Others were initially herding the wildlings south for them to destroy the Night’s Watch.

&gt;”They never came in force, if that’s your meaning, but they were with us all the time, nibbling at our edges. We lost more outriders than I care to think about, and it was worth your life to fall behind or wander off. Every nightfall we’d ring our camps with fire. They don’t like fire much, and no mistake. When the snows came, though…snow and sleet and freezing rain, it’s bloody hard to find dry wood or get your kindling lit, and the cold…some nights our fires just seemed to shrivel up and die. Nights like that, you always find some dead come the morning.”

But their plans may change, since they’re attacking Hardhome and the wildlings that have returned to their villages. It would be horrifying to hear the fires above the Gorge going out one by one during a storm, only to be replaced by a horde of wights. I think this is the least likely option.

**Attacking The Shadow Tower**

I think this will definitely happen. The Weeper knows the Gorge from his feint during Mance’s attack on the Wall, as well as the western Gift from years of raiding.

&gt;And the night before last, a raven had come from the west, from Ser Denys Mallister. Bowen Marsh had chased the wildlings all the way to the Shadow Tower, it seemed, and then farther, down into the gloom of the Gorge. At the Bridge of Skulls he had met the Weeper and three hundred wildlings and won a bloody battle. 

The attack on the Shadow Tower will mean each area of the Wall is in chaos, with Jon’s death at Castle Black and the failed expedition to Hardhome from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

Jon’s old friends, Halder and Toad, may die.

&gt;He read the letter from the Shadow Tower again, sharpened a quill, and unstopped a pot of thick black ink. He wrote two letters, the first to Ser Denys, the second to Cotter Pyke. Both of them had been hounding him for more men. Halder and Toad he dispatched west to the Shadow Tower. Grenn and Pyp to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

So could Wallace Massey, the squire to Denys Mallister, the commander of the Shadow Tower. Could this affect Justin, who is sent north to the Wall in *The Winds of Winter*?

**Attacking Castle Black**

In taking the Shadow Tower, the Weeper could rescue several wildling hostages.

&gt;Bowen Marsh was waiting for him south of the Wall, with a tablet full of numbers. “Three thousand one hundred and nineteen wildlings passed through the gate today,” the Lord Steward told him. “Sixty of your hostages were sent off to Eastwatch and the Shadow Tower after they’d been fed. Edd Tollett took six wagons of women back to Long Barrow. The rest remain with us.”

Some of these hostages may be from Sorren Shieldbreaker’s men, who are garrisoned at nearby Stonedoor. 

With these hostages and his attack on the Shadow Tower, could the Weeper make a bid to become the King Beyond the Wall by attacking other parts of the Wall, perhaps marching on Castle Black? Many wildlings, intent on rescuing Mance or followers of Tormund and Jon, will reject him.

The Weeper may be set up as an enemy for Jon to kill. While as Lord Commander he considered pardoning the chieftain, in resurrected form, hard and wolf-like, he could kill him and execute all of his men. 

&gt;**Jon Snow grasped the spear that bore Garth Greyfeather’s head and wrenched it, violently from the ground**. “Pull down the other two,” he commanded, and four of the crows turned to obey.
___________________________________________________________________________
&gt;“Surely the lord commander cannot mean to allow that … that demon through as well?”
“Not gladly.” **Jon had not forgotten the heads the Weeping Man had left him, with bloody holes where their eyes had been**. Black Jack Bulwer, Hairy Hal, Garth Greyfeather. I cannot avenge them, but I will not forget their names. “But yes, my lord, him as well. We cannot pick and choose amongst the free folk, saying this one may pass, this one may not. Peace means peace for all.”

**Asha And Queenscrown**

A few years ago, Mithras wrote about Asha and Theon being captured by the Weeper. I’m not sure if he believes it any more, but it basically hinges on the two following quotes.  

The Weeper wields a scythe.

&gt;They were armed with spears and fire-hardened lances, all but their leader, a fleshy blond man with watery eyes who bore a great curved scythe of sharpened steel. The Weeper, he knew at once.

And the scythe is also in the sigil of House Harlaw.

&gt;”The Knight will be the Lord of Harlaw after me,” her uncle said, “but he can rule from Grey Garden as easily as from here. Do fealty to him for the castle and Ser Harras will protect you.” “I can protect myself. Nuncle, I am a kraken. Asha, of House Greyjoy.” She pushed to her feet. “It’s my father’s seat I want, not yours. **Those scythes of yours look perilous. One could fall and slice my head off**. No, I’ll sit the Seastone Chair.” “Then you are just another crow, screaming for carrion.”

But Asha is currently in Stannis’ camp, and so is Theon. It’s hard to imagine why Stannis would send either of them away. Maybe after the Battle of Ice, he will dispatch Theon to capture the Dreadfort and send Asha to the Wall as a hostage to guarantee his good behavior? 

In her trip north, she could run into the Weeper. Maybe his attack will mirror Bran’s run-in with the wildlings in *A Storm of Swords* at Queenscrown, with Ghost making an appearance. 

&gt;Asha Greyjoy would have welcomed a fight herself. One battle, to put an end to this misery. Steel on steel, pink snow, broken shields and severed limbs, and it would all be done.

**The Battles Of Ice**

The Weeper being involved in the Battles of Ice is unlikely, as the fight at the crofter’s village has already happened and as far as we know the Shadow Tower remains untaken. Due to the weather, it will be hard to travel south quickly with a large host, unless mounted on garrons with bear paws. Winterfell and the Dreadfort will most likely be taken through guile than a lengthy siege. 

**The Northern Mountains**

Another option is that the Weeper moves south after attacking the Shadow Tower instead of marching on Castle Black. 

The chiefs of the mountain clans worry about this when Tormund is let through the Wall.

&gt;The Norrey fingered his beard. “You may put your wildlings in these ruined forts. Lord Snow, but how will you make them stay? What is there to stop them moving south to fairer, warmer lands?” “Our lands,” said Old Flint. “Tormund has given me his oath. He will serve with us until the spring. The Weeper and their other captains will swear the same or we will not let them pass.” Old Flint shook his head. “They will betray us.”
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;The Norrey hawked and spat. “As well make peace with wolves and carrion crows.” “It’s peaceful in my dungeons,” grumbled Old Flint. “Give the Weeping Man to me.”

Much of the mountain clans’ strength has gone south as winter wolves with Stannis. 

&gt;”How many men?” “Two thousand. Perhaps three.” “Three thousand? What manner of men are these?” “Proud. Poor. Prickly where their honor is concerned but fierce fighters.” “This had best not be some bastard’s trick. Will I trade three hundred fighters for three thousand? Aye, I will. I am not an utter fool.”

But how many men were left behind? How many men does the Weeper have in his host? Without a close count it’s impossible to say if he can conquer the mountains.  If he can, they would be an excellent refuge to survive the winter, avoid the Others, and launch raids on other parts of the North. 

**Last Hearth**

With winter coming, it may be easier to move southeast through the Gift towards the lands of House Umber. 

&gt;“It was true, you could see a long ways from up here. To the south the foothills rose, with the mountains grey and green beyond them. The rolling plains of the New Gift stretched away to all the other directions, as far as the eye could see. “I was hoping we could see the Wall from here,” said Bran, disappointed. “That was stupid, we must still be fifty leagues away.”
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;Snow. It was snowing heavily to the south, Jon knew. Only two days’ ride from here, the kingsroad was said to be impassable. Melisandre knows that too. And to the east, a savage storm was raging on the Bay of Seals. 

Besides the snows, the wildlings also have few horses. While a march to Last Hearth is hard to imagine, the destruction of  the castle has been foreshadowed by Godry Farring. 

&gt;Stannis ground his teeth. “He informs me that Umber will not fight Umber, for any cause.” Jon was not surprised. “If it comes to swords, see where Hother’s banner flies and put Mors on the other end of the line.” **The Giantslayer disagreed. “You would make His Grace look weak. I say, show our strength. Burn Last Hearth to the ground and ride to war with Crowfood’s head mounted on a spear, as a lesson to the next lord who presumes to offer half his homage.**” “A fine plan if what you want is every hand in the north raised against you. Half is more than none. The Umbers have no love for the Boltons. If Whoresbane has joined the Bastard, it can only be because the Lannisters hold the Greatjon captive.”
_______________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;Before him rode three banner bearers. One bore the stag and lion standard of King Tommen, another the Twin Towers of House Frey. The third brandished a bloody head impaled upon the tall point of a spear. An old man’s head it was, white-bearded and one eyes. The spear was…with a pale wood, almost white…along its upper shaft had…dark and red. *Crowfood Umber*, Asha knew. The old northmen had fought to his death, it seemed.

If one part of Farring’s call to action comes true, maybe the other will as well?

Perhaps after failing to rally the wildlings or negotiate with the Night’s Watch, the Weeper will decide to flee south.

**Karhold**

After attacking the Wall and Last Hearth, the Weeper may hear from wildlings that Sigorn, the new Magnar of Thenn, has taken Karhold. Perhaps the giants at Eastwatch will flee there as well. Going there would require submitting to the Magnar and eventually facing Stannis, which the Weeper has refused to do in the past, instead keeping an independent force of wildlings. 

**White Harbor**

Even less likely is the Weeper continuing south after attacking Last Hearth, hugging the coast to aid his march until he arrives at White Harbor. 

Jon considers this in planning the mission to Hardhome.

&gt;When Satin left, Jon seated himself and had another look at the maps of the lands north of the Wall. The fastest way to Hardhome was along the coast…from Eastwatch. The woods were thinner near the sea, the terrain mostly flatlands, rolling hills, and salt marshes. And when the autumn storms came howling, the coast got sleet and hail and freezing rain rather than snow.

This happening depends on the Weeper deciding to flee south and the armies of Stannis, the Boltons, and the Manderlys being engaged elsewhere while the chieftain spends months pillaging the North.

While I do think wildlings will be a threat to White Harbor in the future, I think this is an unlikely path for the Weeper, and instead may fall to Mance or Tormund.

&gt;”He came to save the realm, my lord,” Davos insisted. “To defend your lands against the ironborn and the wildlings.” Next to the high seat, Ser Marlon Manderly gave a snort of disdain. “It has been centuries since White Harbor has seen any wildlings, and the ironmen have never troubled this coast. Does Lord Stannis propose to defend us from snarks and dragons too?”

**What Do You Think?**

So, those are some possibilities for the Weeper. I think he is being set up as a villain for the revived Jon to defeat, perhaps causing some destruction in the North before he is killed. What do you think will happen?",asoiaf
621,"This struck me just now and has probably been noted before. Marywn claims to already know Sam's story from the glass candles. So if this is true, Is it possible that Euron(whom u/YezenIRL argues very convincingly is Urrathon Nightwalker) knows about Sam, the horn, the king's son, Aemon and his ramblings and other relevant stuff about the wall and prophesy through his own candles. I think it is. I think that Euron had always planned to intercept Sam just as Alleras did.

It'd explain why Euron is fixated on attacking oldtown; why he's gone to such great lengths-sacrificing thousands-to get the necessary victories against the defenders of Arbor and oldtown. Oldtown is crucial. Perhaps he knew his proposal to sail the all the longships to mereen would be rejected by the captains and that he'd have to resort to sending Victarion(hence he proactively inserted the sleeper agent- the dusky woman). Perhaps oldtown had been his true objective back at the feast in lord Hewett's hall.

He can rid himself of the Redwynes, the Hightowers,and maesters whilst seizing control of the crucial economic hubs and sea routes of the region(curves out another kindgom whilst awaiting for his bride to be brought to him). At the same time he gains the kingsblood, horn and knowledge(in the books) crucial for his plans. Aemon's conversations about the prophesies and his body might also be useful to him.

Tl;dr Euron has had his eye on the wall and the brothers of the NW possibly as early as the attack by the wights at the fist.",asoiaf
622,"As the time is moving on and the show becomes more and more forgotten, anyone getting more and more hyped or rather getting the old hype back for TWOW?

Knowing the ending is not even a problem, ASOIAF is perfect for re reading, and reading AGOT I am totally enjoying everything happening knowing whatever is happening. Again journey is important as well, tell me at book 1/2 that suddenly there will be a character introduced in Book 5 who will get the Throne and I will find it very stupid but now looking back at Season 8, many of us do think that Aegon VI being on the Throne is needed for the plot and that it is not at all insane (come in fAegon theories)

And on top of that there is soooo much intrigue in the book! Great Northern conspiracy, a possible Maester conspiracy speaking of which Euron is attacking Oldtown and I just can't think of what can happen because come on, how can GRRM just destroy such an old library, a very old city and on top of that there is Leyton Hightower who is locked up for decades doing something, then there are glass candles as well. On the other hand, there is Euron, he pretty much terrifies me as well, not kidding who just started his journey, how can he stop just now? 

And soo many other interesting plot lines, what will happen to Stannis? Skaagos and it's unicorns and Rickon. the ACTUAL story of the White Walkers etc. etc.

I simply can't wait for TWOW! And on top of that it is 99% likely that we will have it in our hands till next year as well which GRRM himself said after years of telling that he won't give any deadlines because he can't follow them implying that this time he might actually be true!",asoiaf

624,"Littlefinger is often described as wicked, subtly by himself as well as Lysa and Cersei. 

&gt;Petyr Baelish smiled. ""I am desperately sentimental, sweet lady. Best not tell anyone. I have spent years convincing the court that **I am wicked** and cruel, and I should hate to see all that hard work go for naught.""     *Eddard IV, AGOT*

&gt;

&gt;""I like my tale better,"" said Littlefinger, ""and so will the smallfolk. Most of them believe that if a woman eats rabbit while pregnant, her child will be born with long floppy ears."" Cersei smiled the sort of smile she customarily reserved for Jaime. ""**Lord Petyr, you are a wicked creature**.""     *Tyrion III, ACOK*
&gt;

The emphasis becomes a little more clear in ASOS when the word 'wicked' is associated with LF thrice in the very same chapter. 

&gt;Lysa Arryn did not seem greatly pleased to see her. Sansa did a deep curtsy, her head bowed. ""A bastard?"" she heard her aunt say. ""**Petyr, have you been wicked**? Who was her mother?""   

&gt;

&gt;Her aunt had brought only three ladies with her, so they pressed Sansa to help them undress Lord Petyr and march him up to his marriage bed. He submitted with good grace and **a wicked tongue**, giving as good as he got.   

&gt;

&gt;The Lady Lysa giggled like a girl. ""**Oh, Petyr Baelish, you are so wicked**. No, I say no, I am the Lady of the Eyrie, and I command you to wed me this very moment!""    

&gt;

&gt;Sansa VI, ASOS

&gt;

The use of 'wicked' continues in AFFC with Myranda Royce. 

&gt;Alayne curtsied. ""My lady is kind to say so."" ""Kind?"" The older girl gave a laugh. ""How boring that would be. **I aspire to be wicked**. You must tell me all your secrets on the ride down. May I call you Alayne?""  *Alayne II, AFFC*

&gt;

Myranda has already shown her intentions to become Lady Littlefinger a few times. And not to say that she isn't keeping her options open. She wanted Harry as well and if Harry dies, her attention might shift to Sweetrobin. 

&gt;""Randa. Count yourself fortunate that I'm so tired. All I want to do is curl up and go to sleep. Usually when ladies share my bed they have to pay a pillow tax and **tell me all about the wicked things they've done**.""

&gt;

&gt;""What if they haven't done any wicked things?""

&gt;

&gt;""Why, **then they must confess all the wicked things they want to do**. Not you, of course. I can see how virtuous you are just by looking at those rosy cheeks and big blue eyes of yours."" She yawned again. ""I hope your feet are warm. I do hate bedmaids with cold feet.""

&gt;

&gt;Alayne II, AFFC

&gt;

In this thread, I am going to consider the two wicked things that Sansa has done and what they might tell us about the wicked things that Alayne will do in TWOW. 



• **Going against her father**



&gt;""It was for love,"" Sansa said in a rush. ""Father wouldn't even give me leave to say farewell."" She was the good girl, the obedient girl, but **she had felt as wicked as Arya** that morning, sneaking away from Septa Mordane, **defying her lord father**.       *Sansa IV, AGOT*

&gt;

In AGOT, Sansa went against her father's wishes to save her betrothal with Joffrey and extend her stay in KL by unknowingly spilling the Ned's plans in front of Cersei. 

In TWOW, it is possible that Alayne will betray her ""father"" by providing crucial information about him to someone. It is hard to say what this info might be and who she will choose to tell. 

Alayne knows a lot about LF's plans and it could be anything from her identity to the fact that he killed Lysa. As for the person who will learn about this, I'm not sure. She has not started trusting Bronze Yohn yet and LF already warned her about Myranda. 



• **Sleeping with Sweetrobin**



&gt;""My lord father has assigned you rooms in the East Tower,"" Lady Myranda was telling Lady Waynwood, ""**but I fear your knights will need to share a bed**. The Gates of the Moon were never meant to house so many noble visitors.""      *Alayne I, TWOW*

&gt;

&gt;""Randa. Count yourself fortunate that I'm so tired. All I want to do is curl up and go to sleep. **Usually when ladies share my bed** they have to pay a pillow tax and tell me all about the wicked things they've done.""

&gt;

&gt;""Why, then they must confess all the wicked things they want to do. Not you, of course. I can see how virtuous you are just by looking at those rosy cheeks and big blue eyes of yours."" She yawned again. ""**I hope your feet are warm. I do hate bedmaids with cold feet**.""

&gt;

With so many guests at the Gates of the Moon, there is hardly enough rooms for most competing knights, which is why most of them will have to share a bed. 

And it seems Myranda and Alayne will also have to share a bed in TWOW, or atleast Myranda intends for Alayne to be her bedmaid. What Myranda does not know (or perhaps she does) is that Alayne already has a sleeping partner. 

&gt;Robert's lip quivered.""I was going to come sleep with you."" I know you were. Sweetrobin had been accustomed to crawling in beside his mother, until she wed Lord Petyr. Since Lady Lysa's death he had taken to wandering the Eyrie in quest of other beds. The one he liked best was Sansa's . . . which was why she had asked Ser Lothor Brune to lock his door last night.    *Sansa I, AFFC*

&gt;

After Lysa died, Robert had to search for a bed partner and in Alayne, he found that. Of course, Alayne didn't like that and had to depend on a little wickedness to keep Sweetrobin away from her room. So, she would tell Lothor Brune to lock Sweetrobin in his room. 

&gt;""No."" He sniffed. ""I never slept one bit, Alayne. He was singing again, and my door was locked. I called for them to let me out, but no one ever came. Someone locked me in my room."" 

&gt;

&gt;""**That was wicked of them**."" Dipping a soft cloth into the warm water, she began to clean his face . . . gently, oh so gently. 

&gt;

&gt;Sansa I, AFFC

&gt;

We know it's really Sansa who was being wicked. 

It is possible that we will see Alayne and Myranda share a bed in the next book and it is also likely that they will have an uninvited visitor in the night, depending on who you ask. 

Now, it is important to remember that Robert likes to sleep in a certain manner. 

&gt; She would not have minded if he only slept, but **he was always trying to nuzzle at her breasts**, and when he had his shaking spells he often wet the bed.

&gt;

&gt; ""I will."" He cuddled close and laid his head between her breasts. ""Alayne? Are you my mother now?""

&gt;

Sweetrobin is getting used to Alayne but how about Myranda? 


https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ai9l96/spoilers_extended_myrandas_secret_plan_to_win_by/


In this thread, u/Mithras_Stoneborn had discussed about Sweetrobin's fetish for breasts and argued that Myranda will use her breasts to charm, entrance and bewitch Robert. 


I think this is how it is going to play out in TWOW. After Harry dies, Myranda and Alayne's attention will shift towards Robert and both will try to win him with their breasts while they all share the same bed. 

Sweetrobin will leave Alayne for Myranda and after realising that she cannot win him back, Alayne will have to become a little wicked and ask Lothor Brune to lock Sweetrobin in his room. 

**TL;DR  The constant use of the word 'wicked' in the Vale storyline as well as in regard to Littlefinger indicate that Alayne will commit two wicked acts that she has already done as Sansa. The first act will be betraying Littlefinger, similar to how she betrayed the Ned. She will also compete for Robert with Myranda while they share the same bed in TWOW. Sweetrobin will switch to Myranda and Alayne will lock Sweetrobin in his room to stop Randa's influence over him**.

626,"So I was re-reading the first book (the only one I have read so far), and a thought occured to me.

In the first book, we get to know the Vale of Arryn and The Eyrie for the first time through Catelyn's POV. We learn it's a place that, not only takes very long time to reach, but getting there is also tricky and dangerous. There's the Hill Tribes, the bloody gate, the mountain itself, etc. 

Basically, it's the safest place in Westeros. You would see an army coming from a very long distance and you would have lots of times to puts siege tactics to good use. Going up the mountain needs to be done really slowly.

So my thoughts are Martin set this place up to be a very important holdfast for protection from the army of the dead, considering it is one of the main concerns of the saga.

Besides, a dragon could easily get there. So if the books were to follow the ""Bran has The Night King mark"", it would be an interesting place to use as protection and bait, instead of the Godswood. 

We don't really know how ""The Long Night"" is going to unfold in the books, but seeing how clever, detailed and important the war and siege strategies were in the books/first half of the series, I thought it might be a good reason to why the trip to the most innaccesible place in Westeros is so detailed.

Or maybe I still have a lot of reading to do and this place already showed its importance in the books.",asoiaf

Perhaps Ned's strict commitment to honor made it impossible to lie or make allegiance to people as morally bankrupt as the Lannisters, but what if he just took her offer to make peace? How would things have played out?

My take: Robert dies soon either way (hunting accident, or something health related since he was fat and drunk all the time), a young Joffrey becomes king, Ned remains the hand, Sansa gets married to Joffrey...aaaaand the Lannisters/Starks probably get into a conflict again very soon.",asoiaf

However, I am now noticing the 3ER says to bran ""the time has come for you to become me"" in which bran replies ""am I ready?"", 3ER response, ""no"", then instantly Bran is warging. The 3ER brings them to winterfell, where bran ultimelty wargs into present Honor, via the past... thus allowing them to escape the cave.

It may have been my mere ignorance but the first time watching, I was under the impression Bran was intentionally warning into Hodor, but was It Bran? Or at this point in time had be just become the 3ER and It was the 3ER sacrificing Hodor?

637,"There is no apostrophe in 'Gods Eye'. I believe this is significant.

&amp;#x200B;

The name 'Gods Eye' initially suggests that the lake itself and the island on it were named that because they look like the eye of a god when viewed on a map: hence, 'god's eye'. However, there is no possessive apostrophe in the name. We can compare 'Gods Eye' to other similar place names in the story where an apostrophe is used to show possession. Flint's Finger, Storm's End and Heart's Home, for example, all have apostrophes, but Gods Eye does not. The discrepancy here leads me to believe that the omission of the apostrophe in 'Gods Eye' was a deliberate choice by George RR Martin.

&amp;#x200B;

In other cases of place names where possession is clearly the intended meaning, but an apostrophe has been omitted, it is because the two words have become one over time. God's Grace became Godsgrace, King's Grave became Kingsgrave and Queen's Crown became Queenscrown, for example - but 'Gods Eye' has stayed two words and has not become 'Godseye'. 'Gods Eye' is consistently two separate words both on maps and in the text. This implies that the word 'gods' in the name 'Gods Eye' is not and never was a possessive (i.e. the word was never ""god's"").

&amp;#x200B;

An explanation for the missing apostrophe is that 'Gods' is a descriptor, where the plural noun 'Gods' is used to describe the 'Eye'. I have only been able to find one other in-universe place analogous to this: Tall Trees Town in the Summer Isles. Just as Tall Trees Town is a town where there are tall trees, the Gods Eye may be an 'Eye' (or in this case a lake that looks like one on a map) where there are (or were) gods.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, the Gods Eye may be called an 'eye' because this is how it looks on a map. But the 'Gods' part does not mean it is the eye of a god. It means that there are gods there. Children of the forest is the likely meaning of 'gods', as they are referred to as gods elsewhere in the books and their pact with the First Men was made there, explaining their presence. I suppose a lot of people already guess that this is the case, but I haven't seen this particular point discussed before.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a needlessly in-depth analysis of punctuation, and the distinctions will likely never even come up in the story. If my reasoning is correct, though, I think it's cool that George made the distinction by not using one (though he could have just called it Eye of the Gods or something - meh).

639,"I know plenty has been written about the botched ending to Littlefinger's story, because a *lot* went wrong in it. But, I want to break down the mechanical elements of the story, because there's more to it than simply smart characters acting stupid, cliche sister-vs-sister conflict, and the worst criminal defense strategy in the history of history (Littlefinger would have been better off with Liar Liar's Fletcher Reede).

If we break the story down into its fundamental parts, we begin to see problems very early. For our protagonist in this portion of the saga, we have Sansa (not really Arya for this bit), and then the show jumps directly to giving us an antagonist in Littlefinger. But wait, that's not how story craft goes. Before we can have an antagonist, we need for the protagonist to have a goal -- the antagonist is what gets between the protagonist and the goal. The structure needs to be ""Protagonist wants something, but antagonist gets in the way,"" and not ""Protagonist. Also antagonist.""

**The Primary Conflict of the Winterfell Intrigue**

For Sansa, the most important goal is protecting her family and the North at large. The threats to that are Cersei, soon the Army of the Dead, and possibly Daenerys later on. Littlefinger isn't an obstacle to this; he's an ally, albeit an untrustworthy one. Littlefinger has to go out of his way to make himself an obstacle to Sansa's goal. Now, if Littlefinger has a strong motivation for this, it can work, otherwise it doesn't. And ""chaos is a ladder"" isn't motivation. Littlefinger isn't the Joker, he doesn't sow chaos for the sake of chaos; he does it when he thinks he'll be able to maneuver into a position of greater power.

Does Littlefinger see Arya as a threat to his influence with Sansa? Maybe, though Arya doesn't seem to have Sansa's ear, we saw Littlefinger try to befriend Bran instead of trying to convince people Bran is dangerous, and he doesn't appear to be working to remove anyone else with political influence (like Lord Royce). He does try to remove Brienne, but she's not really a political counselor to Sansa, just a big meat shield, and having another noble in their retinue is a good asset to Littlefinger (even if Brienne doesn't like him). Scratch off this possibility.

Does Littlefinger hope Arya will kill Sansa, and then most likely be arrested and killed herself, creating a power vacuum in the North? It sounds like a ""Littlefinger thing to do,"" ...but only in a very superficial popcorn-stuffing way. Not only would he still have Jon Snow to contend with later, but he'd be losing influence, not gaining it. Being on good terms with Sansa -- Lysa's niece and Robin's cousin -- helps him maintain his somewhat flimsy influence in the Vale, and it's his best path towards influence in the North as well. What's more, we don't see Littlefinger building alliances with any other lords of the North, people he would need to support him if he wanted to rule. Scratch off this option also.

The result here is that Littlefinger becomes an antagonist to Sansa simply for the sake of giving Sansa an antagonist, and to setup Littlefinger's eventual defeat by a united Sansa and Arya. Littlefinger dies trying to execute a plot he had no reason to pursue in the first place. The events happen solely because the conclusion requires them to do so, not because they make sense to the characters (or they're insufficiently explained for the audience). Sometimes a story needs to arrive at what Michael Byers calls the ""false, required conclusion,"" and [there's an eloquent way to reach it](http://quillandtankard.com/how-to-avoid-contrived-story-beats/), but GoT dropped the ball here.

Most likely what we really needed was a lot more light shone on what Littlefinger was up to so that we could understand him as the protagonist of his own story. He has his own objective (to climb the ladder) and his own obstacles impeding him. If we actually knew why Littlefinger was manufacturing this conflict, the pieces might fall together. Compare against how plainly we see Tyrion's ploy of telling Varys, Littlefinger, and Pycelle different stories about his plans for Myrcella. The editing in that sequence was a bit hokey, but seven hells, at least the audience understands what the story is.

**Resolving the Conflict of the Winterfell Intrigue**

I'll first start by noting that the climax of a story is not a particularly well defined thing. In modern cinema, we often think of it as the big event in the last 20 minutes of a 2 hour film. Luke destroys the Death Star, Frodo throws the Ring into Mt. Doom, Mark Watney blasts off from Mars in his jerry-rigged spaceship. It's when Harold Crick does the thing in Stranger Than Fiction which I'm not going to spoil. If you studied Shakespeare in high school though, you probably learned that the climax comes at the end of Act 3 (in a 5 act play). Hamlet stabs Polonius mistaking him for Claudius. And then according to Robert McKee's *Story*, every act gets its own climax. But, for my purposes here, I'll treat the climax as the moment the primary conflict is resolved, or another way to think about it is when the last serious obstacle has been overcome and the protagonist's objective is no longer in jeopardy.

If we take the Winterfell intrigue plot and ask where the climax of the story is, we find why the ending of this plot line was so underwhelming, aside from having a confounding conflict to begin with.

The show wants the climax to be the sneaky reversal in the trial of Arya where it turns out the trial is really for Littlefinger, and then Arya gives him an OMGSOBADASS^TM death. But it's not.

The climax actually comes when Sansa sneaks into Arya's room, finds the bag of faces, Arya has been waiting, picks up the catspaw dagger, says she could take Sansa's face and become the Lady of Winterfell, and then hands the dagger over to Sansa and walks out. Once that happens, the conflict is resolved. Sansa knows Arya is not a threat and has no design on becoming the Lady of Winterfell, and Arya knows that Sansa knows this, so no need to fear Sansa doing anything foolish. Their cards are on the table, and they know they're both on the same side.

After that scene, Littlefinger poses absolutely zero threat to either Sansa or Arya, or really anyone. Sansa doesn't trust him, Arya avoided being manipulated by him, Lord Royce would sooner be rid of him. If instead of killing Littlefinger they locked him in a cell, nothing changes. If they revealed they know everything he's been up to, and just set him free to walk out of the North on his own, *nothing changes,* (at least not for this conflict). When Littlefinger stands trial, he has no army, no allies, no influence, no power, and poses absolutely zero threat to anyone.

While it's absolutely okay for him to have this kind of loss of power as the ending to his story, the show messes up by trying to have the execution be the climax. For it to be the climax though, the central conflict needed to be resolved in that scene, not earlier. Perhaps the bag'o'faces scene goes differently, Arya is put on trial *for real* and during the questioning the truth about Littlefinger is figured out. Or, perhaps we get more from Littlefinger's point of view, find he's been building alliances with some of the Northern houses (maybe ones that don't want a bastard, a cripple, or a woman in charge), then when he tries to leave the trial there's a genuine moment of tension, echoing back to Ned's betrayal with the City Watch. ...Or maybe the events are the same, but in the bag'o'faces scene it's just obvious the tension has been cleared and the show doesn't try to trick us into thinking the Stark girls don't trust each other. Then, in the trial scene, the focus isn't on Littlefinger. He's a no one now, and the direction is pointed at Sansa and what this moment means for her relationship with the other lords loyal to House Stark.

**tl;dr:** Stories work when there's a protagonist with a goal, an obstacle to that goal we understand, and the conflict is resolved at a moment of heightened tension.

640,"Following the Jaime chapter in ASOS where his motivation (being close to Cersei) for joining the Kingsguard is revealed, Tyrion asks Loras why he joined at such a young age. It dawned on me that it's the most logical choice of station for highborn men with forbidden types of love to have:

&amp;#x200B;

\- The perfect coverup story as to why there would be no marriage, kids or romance with women

\- The close promixity to the most important (and likely most attractive) men in the realm

\- The ability to exert political influence by becoming Lord Commander without having to get involved in marriage alliances etc

\- The backing of (probably) large and powerful family houses to help prevent investigation or punishment of any suspected homosexual acts

&amp;#x200B;

In ASOS there at least 3 Kingsguard members with forbidden romances (Jaime: incest, Loras: gay, Osmund Kettleblack: affair) so it stands to reason that it's always been a smart move for gay highborn men.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:** since some people are claiming that 1/7 isn't above the normal population levels of homosexuality:

1/7 = \~14%. Generally the rate of homosexuality in the general population is thought to max out around 5% so this is about 3 times higher.

641,"We know that Varys came to Westeros to serve Aerys Targaryen. It's less clear whether he served him loyally or not; some say he fuelled the Mad King's paranoia, but Varys did plead with Aerys to bar the gates to Tywin Lannister at the end. Perhaps his early 'prepared prince' figure was originally Rhaegar, only for that plan to veer wildly off the tracks?

Later on, while serving King Robert, the accepted theory is that Varys worked to keep the regime stable until 'Aegon' was old enough to invade and take the throne. But why? Surely a fragmented and war-tired realm would be easier to conquer? And why did Varys not make efforts to remove Stannis Baratheon, still a man in his prime, one of the most effective warleaders in Westeros and surely the most dangerous obstacle to Aegon's invasion? Or Littlefinger, whose fraud and embezzlement could easily land the Iron Throne in debt for a generation?

Why later did Varys want to send Aegon to woo and wed Daenerys? Isn't she exactly the kind of ruler he disdains and would prefer to keep far away?

643," 

Another thread about Bloodraven and ""the brother he loved"" got me thinking about something, and I'm curious to get other thoughts.

I will not go through Bloodraven's entire backstory here, because I will assume we all more or less know it. I will say, however, that I find him the single most interesting and fascinating character in the entire saga because of how clearly we see the effects of his actions on the one hand, yet how controversial those actions are on the other. On the surface, he is the consummate politician and administrator during his time as Hand, practically single-handedly keeping the kingdom together. Yet, his methods were harsh and he was never popular. But again, that's all a different topic.

We know that when King Daeron ""the Good"" died, he was succeeded by his second son, Aerys (his eldest son Baelor, and Baelor's two sons having predeceased him). It is unclear, but reasonable to assume, that Bloodraven had been Master of Whispers under Daeron until this time. King Aerys I now made Bloodraven his Hand, which apparently came as somewhat of a surprise to most - particularly the King's youngest brother, Maekar (the brother between them was Rhaegel, who was still alive, but considered a non-entity - a nice enough fellow, but not too bright). Maekar, deeply offended, removed himself from court and went to ""sulk"" at Summerhall, his seat.

During this time, from the Dunk and Egg stories, we can make some educated guesses here. We know that, from Baelor Breakspear's own mouth, Maekar is ""prickly"". We can also assume that much of what Egg says about Bloodraven is the attitude he has observed from his father, and yet that is also somewhat contradictory. Towards the beginning of ""The Sword Sword"", reflecting on the drought, Egg remarks that many blame Bloodraven, yet that is unfair as the Hand is not responsible for something like that. Yet later, and again in ""The Mystery Knight"", Egg says Bloodraven is ""base born"" and not to be trusted - Dunk corrects him by pointing out that being a bastard is not the same as being base-born, and besides, he was legitimized by Aegon IV. At the end, when we finally meet Bloodraven for the first time, the relationship between Egg and BR is, at best, icy. When BR suggests he might take Egg back to court with him, Egg points out that Maekar would take great offense at that, to which BR agrees. Therefore, it is fairly explicitly indicated that the relationship between Bloodraven and Maekar is not a good one. How hostile they were to one another is unclear, but a degree of hostility almost certainly existed - at least from Maekar towards Bloodraven. As far as Bloodraven's personal feelings towards Maekar...well, like so many of Bloodraven's attitudes, we can only make wild speculation.

Equally telling in the exchange between the Hand and the young prince at Whitewalls, is the deference BR shows to Egg. Now, it is possible that BR's greenseeing as given him either an idea or straight out knowledge that Egg will one day be king, but that's not necessary to explain the interaction. At that time, Bloodraven is the true power in the realm. During the dozen years that Aerys sat on the throne, BR ruled in all but name.

Then, in 221 AC, Aerys died.

Yet, in a move that probably was even more shocking than when Aerys named Bloodraven Hand in the first place, Maekar kept BR as Hand for the entirety of the twelve years he reigned. So this leads to two interesting questions:

1) What, if anything, changed in the relationship between Lord Rivers and now-King Maekar in that the latter would retain his uncle has his Hand, despite their earlier poor relationship? Was it pure pragmatism on Maekar's part, in recognizing that Bloodraven truly was the best man for the job? Was it a matter of ""keep your friends close, and your enemies closer""? And if so, was Bloodraven truly an enemy of Maekar, outside of Maekar's own paranoia? Were they reconciled because they were the two who put down the Third Blackfyre Rebellion in 219 AC and both argued for Bittersteel's execution?

2) We know that while Aerys was king, he left ruling the realm to Bloodraven. I cannot imagine that Maekar would have been so hands-off. We also know that Maekar was killed putting down the Peake Uprising in 233 AC, so it was obvious that even as king, at least in military matters, Maekar was active. So, what was the nature of the relationship between the two while Maekar reigned? How much was still delegated to Bloodraven?

When Maekar was killed, unexpectedly in 233, leaving the succession in crisis, Bloodraven was the undisputed master of the realm during the Great Council that elected Aegon V. Therefore, I don't believe he had been sidelined by Maekar, since a) I believe Bloodraven was a proud man and would simply resigned the Handship rather than be a rubber stamp for Maekar and b) had he been marginalized, he would not have retained the authority to call the Council and - as is strongly implied - politic and maneuver behind the scenes to ensure the election of Aegon V.",asoiaf

Interesting interview on Gold Derby You Tube channel

\-LOVED filming the knighting scene and thought it was very important for her character / the show / women and talks about it extensively (approx half of the interview) - this is part of a series of interviews with Emmy Award contenders and i'd suspect it would be the episode she's submitting so this makes sense.

\-Talks about how much she loves her character and how much everyone else loves their characters and then later about doing work on stuff that ""isn't on the page"" re women's stories (it would be cool if the interviewer expanded more on this as it's really interesting)

\-Said it would have broken her heart if Brienne had died

\-Talks about comforting Conleth in the Last Watch

\-Is diplomatic about the ending (starts about 13:50) - she is well known for having ""predicted"" Bran prior to the scripts coming out so she said she liked it but says she knew it was unconventional and it wouldn't please everyone.

645,"I don't want to harp on what the show should have done or should not have done, but I was wondering.

Most of the faults we see with the characters seem to be driven solely by the writers phoning in dialog and character plots.

However, with Tyrion, I'm wondering if that may not be the case, at least not 100%.

In the books, Tyrion is spiraling down towards a dark future. He's already murdered his father in cold blood, and despite his efforts to help people like Jorah and Penny, they may meet a similar fate.

Then the last few seasons of the show happened. Tyrion's character(along with Varys) went to the wayside of Dany's arc, seemingly just to be another yes man. The two characters(show vs. books) couldn't be more different imo, so it's not out of left field to say they dropped the ball on making his character true to the source.

However, I'd like to bring up the actor, Peter Dinklage. He has seen the most success out of his career from taking on this role. This is his *Godfather*. It's landed him some other large roles, such as Trask in *X-men: Days of Future Past*, and Eitri in *Avengers: Infinity War*.

Dinklage has stated in the past on gaining his popularity through Tyrion Lannister, he'd often turn down roles that were demeaning to dwarfs, which seems to still be the majority of roles offered.

&gt;Even when he was not as big a star and there were even fewer substantive roles for actors with dwarfism, Dinklage says he has never had trouble turning down parts he does not believe in.

&gt;""It's easy. You say, 'No, thank you.' It's getting easier to say it. Not early on, maybe, when you're struggling, but it's good to say no. Because you do have control. 

[The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/emmy-winner-peter-dinklage-says-no-to-magical-dwarf-and-other-lousy-roles)

[Heck, even in the film *Elf*, he even gets called an elf, but gets his revenge for it.](https://youtu.be/02572EyOIzQ) So, maybe that's why he took that role, if not to beat up on tall people who call short people elves.

Anyway, the gist of what I'm getting at is that Dinklage wouldn't take the stereotypical dwarf roles even to the point that he was cast as Eitri, in *Avengers: Infinity War*, and he played a [giant dwarf](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Eitri). It is my opinion that the character was made to be very tall as a caveat for Dinklage accepting the role. Which btw, love it.

So back to Tyrion being depicted as evil. I believe that Dinklage may have had some sway in how his character turned out.

Firstly, aside from the fact that extra facial CGI would run up the budget, [Tyrion does not lose his nose.](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Ffc09.deviantart.net%2Ffs70%2Ff%2F2011%2F231%2Fc%2F3%2Ftyrion_lannister_by_jorgruber-d474pmr.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftheshamefulnarcissistspeaks.com%2F2015%2F12%2F13%2Fcharacter-analysis-tyrion-lannister%2F&amp;tbnid=TfkOVMajE0WXSM&amp;vet=1&amp;docid=R65vI2xTzFiJhM&amp;w=628&amp;h=828&amp;hl=en-US&amp;source=sh%2Fx%2Fim)

Then, as I said above, Tyrion's character gets pushed to the side, for storyline's deemed more important, only to resurface at the end as some kind of all-wise, completely changed character who has no evil intentions at all. In fact, he's the standout character to leave Dany's side when she murders half of King's Landing. Also, he loves and misses his family despite attempts from them to murder him.(Was Jaime ever mad at him in the show?) 

Imo, this won't happen quite the same in the books, as I see Tyrion leaving Dany's side well before. And I don't think any of us see the Lannisters having a backyard BBQ anytime soon.

So, to me, this ""white washing"" of the character could have a lot of influence from the actor himself. There's many examples of Dinklage not accepting the stereotypical role a dwarf actor may play and even instances where it seems he influenced the writers/directors to alter a character for him.

Anyway, just a thought in why there's a discrepancy between the show and books.",asoiaf

651,"It is a widely acknowledged interpretation among the fandom that in the show, Jon inherited most parts of fAegon’s role in the books as the one challenging Dany by his claim to the Iron Throne. But at the dawn of the story where it was supposed to be a trilogy, there was no fAegon and no Blackfyres. In this case, Jon was the only secret heir to the Iron Throne with a better claim than Dany’s. 

&gt; Jon Snow, the bastard, will remain in the far north. He will mature into a ranger of great daring, and ultimately will succeed his uncle as the commander of the Night's Watch. When Winterfell burns, Catelyn Stark will be forced to flee north with her son Bran and her daughter Arya. Wounded by Lannister riders, they will seek refuge at the Wall, but the men of the Night's Watch give up their families when they take the black, and Jon and Benjen will not be able to help, to Jon's anguish. It will lead to a bitter estrangement between Jon and Bran. Arya will be more forgiving ... until she realizes, with terror, that she has fallen in love with Jon, who is not only her half-brother but a man of the Night's Watch, sworn to celibacy. Their passion will continue to torment Jon and Arya throughout the trilogy, __until the secret of Jon's true parentage is finally revealed in the last book__.

This means the second volume featuring Act 2, i.e. Dany’s invasion, was supposed to take place without a Targaryen opponent against her. Dany was supposed to be challenging the Lannisters most of the time, perhaps forming a shaky alliance with the surviving Starks. The end of the second volume might have been the end of the Lannister regime along with the King’s Landing. But it is also possible that this resolution might have been left to the third volume because in the outline, GRRM openly admitted of planning to resolve the hanging threads from Acts 1 and 2 in the final volume. Regardless, Dany would learn about RLJ in the final volume along with everyone else and this would destroy her shaky alliance with the Starks.

With this perspective, the role of fAegon as taken by Jon in the show was already his own thing at the dawn of the story and the show kind of reverted back to the original trilogy idea about Jon vs. Dany.",asoiaf

According to the book, Lord Denys Darklyn, Lord of Duskendale, wanted more autonomy for Duskendale, which is what made him petition for a charter for Duskendale, similar to what Daeron II gave to Dorne a hundred years past. When Tywin rejected the petition, Denys took advantage of the strain in Tywin and Aerys's relationship, and requested Aerys to go to Duskendale to hear his petition in person. Tywin advised Aerys not to go, which is what convinced Aerys to go to Duskendale and force Denys to stand down. 

I know Aerys already had similar instances before this event, where he openly defied Tywin and chose to do the opposite of what Tywin advised. Why did Tywin continue to advise him in the same way?

Reading Fire and Blood, Prince Nymor of Dorne's letter to Aegon the conqueror has to be one of the biggest mysteries of the conquest plot line. I have read many theories and come up with my own analysis.

I think the letter that Deria hands the King is a letter from his sister Rhaenys. I think the letter is her plea for him to stop the war for the sake of her life and the life of her child. In the letter I think she has written information that only she would know (possibly the location of some secret on Dragonstone) so as to give strong evidence to Aegon that she is alive.

Evidence:

\- Aegon is visibly shocked to a point where he cuts himself on his throne and does not realise (what is more of a shock than finding out that the love of your life is alive and been living in Dorne for 3 years)

\- Aegon fly's immediately to Dragonstone and the next morning accepts peace.

\-Aegon allows Deria to live. IF this was some threat from Nymor or some information regarding the prolonged torture of Rhaenys, what is stopping Aegon from returning the favor with Deria.

\- The following year Aegon visits Dorne peacefully. If this was a threat, blackmail or information regarding his sister why would he visit the person who is causing this harm. Possibly he visits his sister wife.

\- As a sign of respect Merexes' skull is delivered but not Rhaenys bones.

\- He burned it to keep her safe. From the Dornish and from anyone who would findo out and wish to disrupt her new peaceful life.

A fun theory. Anything else I have seen seem to offer too many plot holes. Faceless man theory ( Aegon could just hire his own faceless man). Rhaenys being put out of her misery theory ( Aegon would not visit Dorne and would likely start the war again if he gets clarification that she is dead)",asoiaf
657,"From what I've seen of the fandom, most people believe that Aegon with the support of Arianne and Dorne will crush the Lannister-Baratheon reign and take over Kings Landing before Daenerys arrives, setting up an Aegon v. Daenerys. The ending of the show seems to have supported this theory. I was wondering if anyone thinks there's any chance of Aegon losing or if there will still be intermittent warfare between the Lannisters and Aegon when Dany arrives?",asoiaf
658,"I don't understand why the Dance of the Dragons was not immediately chosen as a spinoff for HBO. There is enough for at least a couple of seasons there. The whole thing could perhaps be a Targaryen anthology show. One season can cover Aegon's conquest. Another season could be Maegor's usurpation and downfall.

I get why HBO would not want to adapt Dunk and Egg since it is toned down and on a much smaller scale than the show that just finished, but the Dance seems like it's bigger than anything we ever saw. It makes the War of the Five Kings look like a pillow fight.",asoiaf
659,"I don't think there are a lot of satisfying answers to be had here but I still have some questions about how agriculture works in this universe.

1) What's the full list of crops Westeros has access to? It seems like grain is the primary staple crop, along with the standard old world fruits like apples. But there's at least one New World crop, since the Vale supposedly has pumpkins. And I'm not sure about maize, corn is mentioned but it probably is being used in the older British sense of the word, ""grain."" No sign of potatoes or rice either.

2) Where are the ""cradles of civilization"" on Planetos where agriculture was independently discovered, like the Fertile Crescent, China, Mesoamerica, etc on Earth? Did the Children of the Forest engage in it, or were they hunter-gatherers? For humans, presumably they would all have to be in Essos, perhaps the Rhoyne was one? Yi Ti somewhere? The Womb of the World?

3) What can people grow in the long winters? The North probably doesn't grow anything outside their ""glass gardens"" but the South presumably has to produce something, there's no way their stores would last for years without spoiling. Root vegetables of some kind?",asoiaf
660,"Like most cases in Westeros (and in the real world), Targaryen (or rather, Valyrian) names ending with ""-a"" are more often than not female. For example, Visenya, Rhaenyra and Rhaella.

On the other hand, names ending with ""-on"" are male, the examples being Aegon, Aemon, Daemon and Daeron.

The names ending with ""-or"" or ""-ar"" are also male, like Maegor, Baelor or Maekar.

The problem is with the names ending with ""-ys"", which seem to be gender neutral. For example, Jaeherys, Viserys and Aerys are male, but Rhaenys and Daenerys are female.

Does anyone know/has GRRM specified the Valyrian custom of naming children?",asoiaf
661,"I know that there has been a growing feeling among the Great Houses of Westeros to think not only for themselves, but also for the overall welfare of the ""Realm"". This particular word, though, can be interpreted in many different ways.

The Lords of Westeros probably haven't forgotten that their families were Kings of their specific regions for thousands of years before the Targaryens came. And even if they have been shunted to the title of ""Lord"" from ""King"", it has been only for three hundred years.

They bent the knee to Aegon and his dragons. And even after Aegon was dead, they remained under the Targaryen rule because of fear of the dragons and the Iron Throne.

Even after the dragons went extinct, it was the fear of the Iron Throne that kept them under the rule. After the Targaryens were gone, it was still the fear of the Iron Throne that kept the Seven Kingdoms united. Also, the fact that Robert Baratheon was the son of Aerys Targaryen's cousin helped the succession.

After the finale however, I don't understand *why* the Lords of Westeros elect a new King to rule over the Seven (now Six) Kingdoms? After all, there is no Iron Throne, there is no Red Keep, King's Landing is in ruins, and the King they elected doesn't even belong to the line of the Targaryens.

And especially since the North becomes an independent Kingdom, I just don't see how long the remaining Kingdoms will stay under the Crown. I think electing Bran was a horrible decision, which will lead to many bloody wars in the future.",asoiaf
662,"One of the most important parts of the setting of asoiaf is that the seasons are unpredictable and can last for years. With winters potentially lasting for 5 years and there being no way to predict when winter will actually arrive, the castles in this setting must be constantly stockpiling grain. It is mentioned in some of the northern chapters, for example, that it is typical to save a fifth of the harvest each year at minimum. The point is, castles in Westeros are constantly well stocked with food.

So then how was Storm's End, one of the greatest and most important castles in the kingdoms, nearly starved out in less than a year? It is mentioned that due to the war being unexpected, the storehouses were not full, but considering the ever-present issue of winter in this setting, surely they would have still been plentiful considering the fact that it is implied that a relatively small force was left behind, at most a couple hundred men. In fact, it is strange to imply that they hadn't had time to fill their stores, as the previous year was the famous year of the false spring, which implied that it was still late into winter when the rebellion broke out. So its unlikely that there would have been much food to be gathered in the first place, and the stores, while running low, were meant to feed a far larger number of people than just the castle garrison, such as the local smallfolk, so it seems odd that they would have run out after a year.

Now, it could be argued that Storm's End is far south enough that winters for it are not as dire as in the North, but even then, this isn't Dorne, and the Stormlands are well known for poor weather, so its winters, while maybe not cold, are probably still not suitable for growing crops.

And this problem doesn't just apply to Storm's End as well. Practically every castle in this setting must have internal stores for the winter, for its entire household and in many cases the surrounding peasants. The Eyrie is probably the only notable exception outside of Dorne, as during the winters the Arryns stay at the Gates of the Moon. Northern castles especially probably have huge storerooms relative to their size. Winterfell, after all has to feed all the peasants for leagues surrounding it. As such, it actually makes sense that so many sieges in the books end in storming the castles, but still it is odd how having enough food is a problem at the end of a long summer. Surely after 10 years of storing grains, there must be enough to last a long, long winter in every castle in the land?",asoiaf
663,"I was thinking about this Bloodraven quote from ADWD

&gt; I have my own ghosts, Bran. A brother that I loved, a brother that I hated, a woman I desired. Through the trees, I see them still, but no word of mine has ever reached them. The past remains the past. We can learn from it, but we cannot change it.

If we assume the brother he hated was Bittersteel, who was the brother he loved? Was it Daemon who was apparently incredibly charismatic and popular, or Daeron whose side Bloodraven fought for? Did Shiera Seastar have something to do with this? Did Bittersteel push Daemon to rebel to spite Bloodraven?",asoiaf
664,"The battle between the mountain clans and the ironborn after their retreat from Deepwood Motte reminds me of the Long Night. This has been written about by Lucifer Means Lightbringer, who has talked about how the trees resemble the Others, indicating that they were created by the Children of the Forest. He also discusses [here](https://lucifermeanslightbringer.com/2017/09/03/the-cat-woman-nissa-nissa/) some of the symbolism he sees in Asha. 

I don’t have much to add, but wanted to post some quotes from the battle itself and see what you all thought. Am I reading too much into this? Probably.

The fight reminds me of the Battle for the Dawn. 

&gt;No singer would ever make a song about that battle. No maester would ever write down an account for one of the Reader’s beloved books. No banners flew, no warhorns moaned, no great lord called his men about him to hear his final ringing words. **They fought in the predawn gloom, shadow against shadow, stumbling over roots and rocks, with mud and rotting leaves beneath their feet**. The ironborn were clad in mail and salt-stained leather, the northmen in furs and hides and piney branches. **The moon and stars looked down upon their struggle**, their pale light filtered through the tangle of bare limbs that twisted overhead.

Like the Last Hero, Asha loses her companions in the course of the battle.

&gt;Somewhere in the ebb and flow of battle, Asha lost Qarl, lost Tris, lost all of them. 
____________________________________________________________
&gt;”So as cold and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the children, in the hopes that their ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost.” **He set out into the dead lands with a sword, a horse, a dog, and a dozen companions**. For years he searched, until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities. **One by one his friends died, and his horse, and finally even his dog, and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it**.”

She also loses her weapons, like the Last Hero did. 

&gt;Her dirk was gone as well, and all her throwing axes; instead she had a sword in hand, a short sword with a broad thick blade, almost like a butcher’s cleaver. For her life she could not have said where she had gotten it. Her arm ached, her mouth tasted of blood, her legs were trembling, and shafts of pale dawn light were slanting through the trees. Has it been so long? How long have we been fighting? 

This reminds me of the myth of Azor Ahai forging Lightbringer.

Both the northmen and the Others snuck up on their prey.

&gt;”And the Others smelled the hot blade in him and came silent on his trail, stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as hounds.”
____________________________________________________________
&gt;Half her men were on their feet by then, reaching for shields and spears and axes. *They lit no torches either*, Asha  had time enough to think, *and they know these woods better than we ever could*. Then the trees erupted all around them, and the northmen poured in howling. *Wolves*, she thought, *they howl like bloody wolves*. *The war cry of the north*.

Finally, Asha is captured by Morgan Liddle.

&gt;**And then her back came hard against a tree, and she could dance no more**. The wolf raised the axe above his head to split her head in two. **Asha tried to slip to her right, but her feet were tangled in some roots, trapping her**. She twisted, lost her footing, and the axehead crunched against her temple with a scream of steel on steel. The world went red and black and red again.

I know the wedding to Hizdar sorta solved the internal problems, but isnt an unwanted evil( maybe an exaggeration) like a wedding to someone you don't want for the sake of stability sort of like slavery? Obviously this is pushing the definition of both slavery and evil but I think it's interesting point to think about.

Background characters that have no importance to any of the stories or innocent children. Tyrion and Jaime are exceptions.

She is clearly jealous of Jon's unknown mother because she thinks Ned loved her more and that if she were alive, he would want or choose to be with her instead. Instead of emotionally abusing Jon to the detriment of his relationship with his siblings, why didn't she just leave? Her emotional abuse of Jon does impact her own children. They love their brother, but her making him feel unwelcome and dehumanizing him by not referring to him by his name, only as a ""bastard,"" has a clear influence on her children. For instance, Sansa dehumanizes him as well and Arya worries her mother will not accept her because she looks like Jon instead of a Tully like the rest of her siblings. It even influences her relationship with her husband. He thinks her cruel for wanting to send Jon away because he loves Jon as if he were his own.

673,"Bran wearing a fucking blue sweater when he becomes King cannot be a coincidence. You know who else wore blue? You guessed right - THE NIGHT KING. 

Why does Bran ask for Drogon's whereabouts? If not to use Drogon as a weapon, why would a king of semi peaceful kingdom bring a dragon into play? Unless Bran is the GOSH DAMN FUCKING NIGHT KING.

And the icing on top - Bran the Broken's infamous line: 

*Why do you think I came all this way?*

If Bran no longer ""wants"" anymore, then why did he accept Kingship when there were obviously better choices? My theory is that when Mr. NK marked Bran in season 6, he placed a ""gateway"" on Bran. Later, when NK dies, he somehow possess Bran through the gateway. That explains why Bran said that he came all this way to be King of Westeros.

#Bran is the Night King.

Alright, so Bran is *almost* perfectly set up for a Night King reveal. It would subvert expectations, yes, but it would make sense. But what do D&amp;D do? They troll me. While watching EP 6, I kept bringing up the info bar on the video player, becoming increasingly saddened that their was not enough time for an exiting reveal.

674,"There's been the saying going around how people who are criticising the show are only ""mad at how it happened, not what happened"". Which I agree with in some aspects, I can see tyrion and sansas endings as belivable, but they happened in cheap ways. 

However, some things I completley don't like. Jamie going back to cersei and them dying together completley ruins his development. He goes from selfish and hateful man -&gt; showing empathy and wanting to help the fight for the living -&gt; go back to cersei who doesn't care for the living and is self-centered as anything. None of this is shown in a beliveable way, and that's part of what I mentioned earlier, but I can't see how jamie would go down that path and revert back to square one while having him be a changed character. 

Jon also going north in self-exile is also something I don't like. He already lost one girl, and he was willing to die facing mance to end the carnage caused he blamed himself for her death, but I still find it a far cry that he would leave his family and life behind for dany's death. Sure, he would've probably stayed there in grief and greyworm would've caught him, I can maybe believe that, but I can't believe that he wouldn't be by sansa or bran's side. 

I feel like a lot of these things George plans, but doesn't know how to get there. Which is why we had a long wait, cause some things for the characters are rather absurd. Especially bran being king of six kindgoms. Nevermind the north declaring independency and no one else doing the same, the dude basically foresaw kings landing being destroyed, and says/does nothing. Plus, his role is a lot more oriented with the whitewalkers, and bran has 0 political experience. Sure tyrion can do a lot of legwork, but then what's the point of having him be king?",asoiaf

680," 

So I felt bored and decided to look at the family trees of westeros, and I noticed something. A popular theory that goes around states that Mance Rayder = Arthur Dayne, Tormund Giantsbane = Gerold Hightower, and Qhorin Halfhand = Oswell Whent.

So I've always felt that ""Qhorin"" was a very unique name in westeros and I couldn't place it. It didn't seem like a name native to the north, or the riverlands, or really anywhere. So I looked it up.

The only other Qhorin's mentioned are Ironborn, and specifically they're Ironborn of House Hoare and related to Harren the Black. More or less, they're all related to Harrenhal.

There's Qhorin Volmark who was a great nephew to Harwyn Hardhand, grandfather of Harren the Black. Harwynd Hardhand was the first Hoare King that took the River Lands and became ""King of the Isles and the Rivers"" After the burning of Harrenhal, and this Qhorin claimed to be the heir of the black line of House Hoare.

Similar names are Qhorwyn the Cunning, who was father to Harwyn Hardhand.

Then there's Qhored the Cruel who is written as being The Greatest Hoare King. He was apparently the best Iron born King ever. During the reign of King Qhored, the Ironborn could rightfully claim that his writ ran ""wherever men can smell salt water or hear the crash of waves.""

Harwyn also had another grandson who became Lord Commander Hoare of the Night's Watch. His first name isn't stated, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was Qhorin or Qhorwyn.

So I think it's interesting. The name Qhorin seems to point right at House Hoare and Harrenhal. Harrenhal is the seat of House Whent, and it's where Oswell Whent was born. The Oswell = Qhorin theory is super out there, but I think it's a fun one. It also might explain why Qhorin practically got caught on purpose, if you think that he was expecting to be caught by Tormnd. So I think this information is fun.

For reference, the family tree's do seem to laugh right in your face. As a counter example, let's look at the Stark Bastards.

There's Brandon Snow, was the bastard half-brother of Torrhen Stark, the King who knelt. Brandon was kind of Awesome. Brandon Snow offered to cross the Trident alone at night, to sneak into the Targaryen camp and assassinate the dragons while they slept. our greenseer Bran see's a vision of of a ""pale, fierce, and dark-eyed young man, who slices three branches off the weirwood and shapes them into arrows.""

There's Sara Snow who was the sister to Cregan Stark (The particularly Badass one.) ""By Mushroom's account, Jacaerys Velaryon, the Prince of Dragonstone, fell in love with Sara when he arrived at Winterfell in 129 AC to secure the support of Sara's brother, Lord Cregan Stark, for Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen during the Dance of the Dragons. According to Mushroom, Sara and Jacaerys slept together, and Sara's half-brother Cregan grew angry when he learned about this. However, he calmed when Sara claimed that she and Jacaerys had secretly wed, having spoken their vows in the godswood of Winterfell before she and Jacaerys had sex amidst the snows."" Okay so Jacaerys is a Targaryen heir, a dragon rider. ""Archmaester Gyldayn questions whether Sara ever existed and dismisses the tale of marriage as as Mushroom's ""fevered imaginings"", stating that what is known about Jacaerys's character makes it unlikely he would break his betrothal of eleven years to Lady Baela Targaryen to protect the virtue of the northern bastard girl."" Clear Jon Snow implications. Also Jack=John; so there.

Next is Lonnel Snow who was a bastard son of Lord Brandon Stark and Lady Wylla Fenn. Wylla Fenn was from the neck, a crannogman (crannogwoman). Again, clear Jon Snow implications. Howland Reed is a Crannogman who might have conspired with Ned to hide Jon's heritage. ""Wylla"" is the name Ned puts as Jon's mother. So there. I'm probably super late on this stuff but it was fun to post about it.",asoiaf
681,"This thought has been in my head for awhile so I wanted to share it with you all to hear what you think.

During Dany's POV chapters, she has had a few interactions with a mysterious  character named Quiathe. Now the consensus I see online is that this  figure has been communicating through the glass candles which we know  are now burning. However, what if Quiathe and all the prophecies that  came with her were all in Dany's head the whole time? I wonder if that  could be one of the biggest plot reveals of the upcoming books; the  revelation that *Dany was slowly going mad this entire time.*

What makes me think this? Last we saw Dany, she was walking through the  Dothraki sea shitting water and drinking that shit water. In that  chapter, she has a vision of Quiathe warning her once again with  prophecies. What caught me off guard too was how Quiathe says that she  shouldn't have spent so much time in Slaver's Bay and that Westeros was  where she should be going. If Dany was hallucinating Quiathe, perhaps  this could be Dany's own regret and desire to go to Westeros manifesting  in this madness.

If Quiathe is just a figment of Dany's imagination, then how come we see  signs of these prophecies about the lion, the griffin, the mummer's  dragon and so on? Dany could be connected to these glass candles, or the  magic in the world anyway, and that's how she's been getting these  premonitions. What concerns me is that she has yet to understand what  these predictions mean, and perhaps her mind has been manifesting these  signals from the magic in the world in a dangerous way.

Could the glass candles be an underlying catalyst for Dany's madness? Will  she become the mad queen because of all this magic messing with her  mind?

It makes me think back to the theory that Bloodraven was sending messages to Aerys, leading to his madness.

I wonder if it could lead to the same case with Dany.

Anyway. Just a weird thought of mine. This could be all wrong of course.",asoiaf
682,"So, in the show, Sansa was given Jeyne Poole's plot in the middle seasons, more or less. This was criticized by many, and I am always down for some GoT mid-to-late-season criticism, but how bad was this particular one actually?

In the show, Sansa's abuse by Ramsay becomes a big part of her character (and in effect, Theon's, which opens up a new can of worms), so it would be strange to do this on the showrunners' part if she doesn't experience something similar in the books. It would make the two characters have different personalities, or at least a different mindset and motivations. Which isn't the worst crime D&amp;D have committed but when you consider that then the only reason they did it was for the shock of it, it would be at least a stupid move to pull.

However, what if Sansa has similar experiences, but at the hands of a different person? Potentially Harry the Heir but it could be others too, even Littlefinger himself. But Harry would make the most sense, as she would still have the same dynamic with Littlefinger in the aftermath, feeling betrayed by his poor judgement when setting her up with someone he hasn't properly vetted at best.

If this ends up being the case, it makes the direction taken in the show make more sense, as it just becomes a ""TV Streamline"" decision, like making Rodrick be the close friend Theon personally beheads at Winterfell. As someone who almost always prefers pure adaptations I still wouldn't love the Sansa/Ramsay decision but I could certainly accept it.

And speaking of Theon, I would argue that this decision could then affect him even more than Sansa. The theme that was beaten over our heads for the past 2 seasons or so is that Theon is a True Stark After All (and apparently a Good Man... wonder if he's a member of house Twenty Goodmen).

But, if Theon ""only"" saves Jeyne Poole, then why do the Starks so willingly forgive him for the horrendous actions he took against Winterfell and its people? And if the Starks don't forgive him easily, or forgive him at all, then why does the show go in this direction? I'm hoping that I'm not just asking a rhetorical question with that last one.

But yeah. To sum it up, I think Sansa's direction in the show could actually have a decent reason to it, but it still doesn't address the repercussions it has on Theon's story.

Final note: I'm well aware that being the victim of sexual assault doesn't define who you are, but any experience can shape who you are, and in Show Sansa's case, this is one that she has acknowledged as having made a big impact on who she is multiple times.",asoiaf
683,"It’s Bran. 

**Born again amidst salt and smoke when the red star bleeds**

In ACOK, his third eye opens in the crypts of Winterfell, while the red comet hands overhead. When he comes up, Winterfell is shrouded in salt(the ironmen?) and more obviously, smoke. 

**When darkness gathers**, others probably, makes little impact. Just for dramatic effect methinks. 

**To wake dragons from stone**

With his new powers he will become Bloodraven. In the show Bran has a hand in Jon learning the truth, how else in the books too? Howland Reed is possible, but I think he’ll be proof not the actual person to *wake dragons from stone*. 


This makes sense when you realise GRRM plans for him becoming king by the end and also the fact that he’s the first POV. I thought little of that, after all not long after he nearly dies, but maybe GRRM subverted our subverted expectations by not subverting them?

684," 

&gt;*Outside the inn on a weathered gibbet, a woman's bones were twisting and rattling at every gust of wind.*  
*I   know this inn. There hadn't been a gibbet outside the door when she  had  slept here with her sister Sansa under the watchful eye of Septa Mordane, though. ""We don't want to go in,"" Arya decided suddenly, ""there might be ghosts."" Arya ASOS XIII*

Throughout  asoiaf one of recurring locations is the ancient and inconsistently named Inn at the Crossroads. It serves as the meeting place for many different characters and a focal point for some of the most  consequential events in the series.

However   I’d argue it also serves as a microcosm for the common folk and their   treatment and attitudes in the series. For instance at the beginning of   GOT while norms are still being upheld and the social contract is   function relatively well Masha Heddle (a smallfolk woman) houses   Robert’s routine without issue, she is assumably reimbursed for her   hospitality and all functions as it should. Cat remembers staying at the   Inn at the Crossroads as a child and the preferential treatment Masha   Heddle gave her as the daughter of a major lord.

&gt;*She   had slept many a night there in her youth, traveling with her father.   Lord Hoster Tully had been a restless man in his prime, always riding   somewhere. She still remembered the innkeep, a fat woman named Masha   Heddle who chewed sourleaf night and day and seemed to have an endless   supply of smiles and sweet cakes for the children.*

These   incidents serve of Westeros operating as it is intended. The smallfolk are deferental to their betters and the lords are benevolent or at  least  indifferent to the smallfolk. However later in GOT when Ned  begins to  see the rot in Robert’s reign and Catelyn is traveling back  to  Winterfell after revealing what she thinks is a massive conspiracy   against the crown, she stays at the Inn at the crossroads in disguise.  
Coincidentally  Tyrion Lannister on his way home from the Wall, enters at  the same  time and recognizes Catelyn, she, seeing no other option calls  on her  father’s bannermen to arrest him. Thus making the Inn and it’s  denizens  complicit (in the eyes of Tywin at least) complicit in the abduction  of a Noble Lord.

&gt;*Scarlet-tinged spittle flew from the fat innkeep's mouth as she begged of Catelyn Stark, ""****Don't*** ***kill*** ***him*** ***here****!""*  
*""Don't kill him anywhere,"" Tyrion urged.*  
*""Take him somewheres else, no blood here, m'lady, I wants no high lordlin's* ***quarrels***\*.""\*

Masha   is visibly disturbed by this and for very good reason. One of the most   prevalent themes in the book is the horrors that are visited upon the   smallfolk caught in the crossfire of feuding lords. Later we see the   gruesome fate of Masha Heddle.

&gt;*The   inn and it's stables were much as he remembered, though little more   than tumbled stones and blackened foundations remained where the rest of   the village had stood. A* ***gibbet*** *had   been erected in the yard, and the body that swung there was covered   with ravens. At Tyrion's approach they took to the air, squawking and   flapping their black wings. He dismounted and glanced up at what   remained of the corpse. The birds had eaten her lips and eyes and most   of her cheeks, baring her stained red teeth in a hideous smile. ""A room,   a meal, and a flagon of wine, that was all I asked,"" he reminded her   with a sigh of reproach.*

Through   no fault or will of her own Masha is held responsible for the actions   of Catelyn and killed to assuage Tywin’s wounded pride. Masha was   adjacent to a wrong done to a Lannister and so she must be made into a   lesson. Masha is merely one of the first smallfolk victims of the rape   of the riverlands which soon exceeds a single Inn or the residents of   Wendish Town and encompasses an entire region of Westeros. The smallfolk   killed are not slaughtered for any reason but to balm Tywin’s rage,   anger the River Lords, and to prove the strength of the Lannisters.

The   social contract however threadbare a protection it provided the   smallfolk is disregarded in the most horrific way by Tywin Lannister a   pattern that gets only more horrific and all encompassing the longer the   War of the Five Kings Drags on.

The   Inn at the Crossroads returns in ASOS when Arya and Sandor go in to get   drinks and dull the pain of the unrelenting trauma conga line that was   ASOS. The Inn is now under the ownership of Masha’s nephew.

&gt;*“""Looking for a cup of wine.* ***Innkeep***\*, a flagon of red."" Clegane threw a handful of coppers on the floor.\*  
*""I don't want no trouble, ser,"" the innkeep said.*  
*The* ***innkeep*** *came   scurrying back with two stone cups and a flagon on a pewter platter.   Sandor lifted the flagon to his mouth. Arya could see the muscles in his   neck working as he gulped. When he slammed it back down on the table,   half the wine was gone. ""Now you can pour. Best pick up those coppers   too, it's the only coin you're like to see today.""*  
*""We'll pay when we're done drinking,"" said Polliver.*  
*""When you're done drinking you'll tickle the innkeep to see where he keeps his gold. The way you always do.""*  
*The* ***innkeep*** *suddenly   remembered something in the kitchen. The locals were leaving too, and   the girls were gone. The only sound in the common room was the faint   crackling of the fire in the hearth. We should go too, Arya knew.”*

We   see the smallfolk once again caught in a quarrel this time between the   Hound a minor lord and men in the service of Gregor Clegane, after   witnessing the atrocities visited on blameless smallfolk by the Mountain   and even the rape and murder visited upon another Innkeep by Chiswyck,   we see how thoroughly the feudal contract disintegrates in times of  war  and who suffers the most for it’s loss. In A Feast for Crows we  learn  the fate of the Innkeeper and the sexworkers who served Sandor  and Arya,  from Pyg the Bloody Mummer.

&gt;*""He   might have, but he didn't. Later on, we heard how the Hound slew three   of his brother's men at an inn by the crossroads. The girl was with  him  there. The* ***innkeep*** *swore   to it before Rorge killed him, and the whores said the same. An ugly   bunch, they were. Not so ugly as you, mind you, but still . . .""*

Like   countless smallfolk, the peasants at Harrenhal, Nimble Dick, the   citizens of Saltpans, the Innkeep and his staff are murdered because of   the actions of Sandor and Arya an incident they could not by any means   have prevented. Not that the Bloody Mummers would have left them   unmolested regardless of Sandor’s actions.  
Like Masha the Innkeeper's   son was adjacent to an incident where a lord’s pride was pricked and  so  he and his staff are murdered without consequence, they are, after  all,  only peasants.

But this is far from   the last we see of the Inn at the Crossroads. Now in context, unlike  the  relative contentement of the smallfolk in AGOT, the placidity  enforced  with brutality in ACOK, and at last, the awakened fury in ASOS  as  demonstrated by the Brotherhood without Banners, the Crow Cages in   Stoney Sept, and the shelter and support given to the BWB, we see more   agency for the smallfolk.

This comes to   a head (fittingly) at the Inn at the Crossroads in Brienne V. Masha and   her nephew are dead, but in their place are Willow and Jeyne Heddle,   Masha’s nieces. Ironically the little girls, armed with crossbows, other   traumatized orphans, and a partnership with the BWB (now under new   management) are far more protected than their predecessors. In the   complete absence of order, a new order is made in its place. One much   less friendly to the old customs they’ve watched fall to dust and bones.

&gt;*The Hound laughed. ""You got that backwards. It'll be me killing you. I'd do it now, but m'lady wants to see you hanged.""*  
*Hanged.   The word sent a jolt of fear through her. She looked at the girl,   Jeyne. She is too young to be so hard. ""Bread and salt,"" Brienne gasped.   ""The* ***inn*** *. . . Septon Meribald fed the children . . . we broke bread with your sister . . .""*  
*""Guest   right don't mean so much as it used to,"" said the girl. ""Not since   m'lady come back from the wedding. Some o' them swinging down by the   river figured they was guests too.""*

Guest   right didn’t save her aunt, nor her brother, and so what use is it to   Jeyne or any other small folk? The Bloody Mummers, the Boltons, the   Karstarks, the Lannisters, cut a bloody swathe across the Riverlands and   now the smallfolk defend the carcass.

Out   of the charred ashes of the Inn at the Crossroads, previously an   institution representative of a functioning feudal system, then a   tenuous remnant of a system that worked, then a monument to a new order   developed by necessity the Inn at the Crossroads serves as a microcosm   for the brutality and thoughtlessness the smallfolk we’re treated with   and then as an example of the burgeoning agency of the smallfolk.

After all in the wise words of Septon Meribald,

&gt;""No.   The lions hanged her. After they moved on, I heard that one of her   nephews tried opening the inn again, but the wars had made the roads too   dangerous for common folk to travel, so there was little custom. He   brought in whores, but even that could not save him. Some lord killed   him as well, I hear.""  
Ser Hyle made a wry face. ""I never dreamed that keeping an inn could be so deadly dangerous.""

Also, albeit I love knowing the little details and small lores of a world, is reading things like Fire and Blood or The World of Ice and Fire worth it?

688,"Stoneheart will kill Littlefinger. 

Not sure if this idea has been floated before,  but as i think about what Baelish’s fate will be in the book as opposed to the show, I’m sure it will be much different. I think he will still die, but not at the hands of Arya.

Think about it, as far as we can tell, D&amp;D have been pretty true about giving characters the ending they’ll get in the books(although I’m doubting Cersei/Jaime’s will be that way) , but for the most part even if the path to that ending is botched, the ending itself is usually right. 

And I can’t see Arya killing Baelish in the books. He’s not on her list, I don’t believe. So why would they go with that ending rather than the one George has for him? Because George’s ending requires a character that does not exist. 

In seasons 6(10)/7/8, it seems the writers mixed a lot of Arya’s plotline with that of Lady Stoneheart. Mainly, the revenge upon the Freys. 

Poetically, it seems completely fitting that LSH should be the one to kill Baelish given their relationship. It also fits thematically, with one of the great political players in the story being killed by a “super natural force”. 

Seems like a no-brainer to me. Thoughts?",asoiaf

In the show Bran provided some intel on the White Walkers. The show didn’t really handle military tactics well but this role could be considerably expanded in the books.

692,"__TL DR__: Egg is meant to be a precursor to Dany, including his tragic end.

###Intro

After Dany’s downfall is revealed in the show, the readers realized how essential the involvement of Young Griff is in the story. But the important thing is that Young Griff does not come out of thin air. He comes riding a backstory, the Blackfyre expansion of the world-building.

GRRM created the Blackfyre backstory during the writing of ACoK where the series expanded from 4 books to 6 books with a 5 year gap after book 3. Before this point, Dany’s “invasion” was supposed to be the “second greatest threat” to Westeros. This was a vague idea that GRRM did not have clear clues to work with. After the Blackfyre angle was created, this upcoming conflict of Dany became more grounded in history and hence promising a stronger story.

But GRRM did not stop there. He also created another backstory; the Dance of Dragons, which clearly gives another perspective to the upcoming conflict between Dany and Young Griff. It is unclear whether GRRM once entertained the idea of a descendant of Aerion being Dany’s adversary in the upcoming Dance of Dragons. Brightfyre theory incorporates both the Blackfyre and Brightflame angles. 

Regardless of the Brightfyre theory or the pure Blackfyre theory, the ultimate purpose of GRRM seems clear: he had the endgame for Dany in mind since the beginning but he did not have clear ideas about how to reach there. The expansion of the world-building about Blackfyres and the Dance of Dragons provided him a template to work with similar conflicts and characters. All of the Targaryen history work for Fire &amp; Blood seems like a practice for writing the story of Dany in the main series, which brings us to the main point of this thread.

---

I think after the show revealed Dany’s endgame, it became clear that even the D&amp;E novellas were meant to serve as a template for Dany’s downfall. There are several parallels that can be drawn between Dany and Egg, which I leave to you because many readers made these comparisons as soon as TWOIAF was published. Some of them goes even directly to the novellas themselves.

&gt; There were other battles during the time of Aegon V, for the unlikely king was forced to spend much of his reign in armor, quelling one rising or another. Though beloved by the smallfolk, King Aegon made many enemies amongst the lords of the realm, whose powers he wished to curtail. He enacted numerous reforms and granted rights and protections to the commons that they had never known before, but each of these measures provoked fierce opposition and sometimes open defiance amongst the lords. The most outspoken of his foes went so far as to denounce Aegon V as a “bloodyhanded tyrant intent on depriving us of our gods-given rights and liberties.”

&gt; It was well-known that the resistance against him taxed Aegon's patience—especially as the compromises a king must make to rule well often left his greatest hopes receding further and further into the future. As one defiance followed another, His Grace found himself forced to bow to the recalcitrant lords more often than he wished. A student of history and lover of books, Aegon V was oft heard to say that had he only had dragons, as the first Aegon had, he could have remade the realm anew, with peace and prosperity and justice for all.

&gt; And intent on one more thing: dragons. As he grew older, Aegon V had come to dream of dragons flying once more above the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. In this, he was not unlike his predecessors, who brought septons to pray over the last eggs, mages to work spells over them, and maesters to pore over them. Though friends and counselors sought to dissuade him, King Aegon grew ever more convinced that only with dragons would he ever wield sufficient power to make the changes he wished to make in the realm and force the proud and stubborn lords of the Seven Kingdoms to accept his decrees.

&gt; The last years of Aegon's reign were consumed by a search for ancient lore about the dragon breeding of Valyria, and it was said that Aegon commissioned journeys to places as far away as Asshai-by-the-Shadow with the hopes of finding texts and knowledge that had not been preserved in Westeros.

&gt; What became of the dream of dragons was a grievous tragedy born in a moment of joy. In the fateful year 259 AC, the king summoned many of those closest to him to Summerhall, his favorite castle, there to celebrate the impending birth of his first great-grandchild, a boy later named Rhaegar, to his grandson Aerys and granddaughter Rhaella, the children of Prince Jaehaerys.

&gt; It is unfortunate that the tragedy that transpired at Summerhall left very few witnesses alive, and those who survived would not speak of it. A tantalizing page of Gyldayn's history—surely one of the very last written before his own death—hints at much, but the ink that was spilled over it in some mishap blotted out too much.

Long story short, when Egg became the King, he tried to make reforms that improve the lives off the smallfolk (whose troubles he knew well from his time squiring for Dunk), but this infuriated the nobility and caused a lot of troubles in his reign (_hint for breaking the wheel_). It also did not help that his children chose love over duty (_hint hint_), and married according to their heart’s desire instead of accepting those arranged marriages with Great Houses and strengthening the dynasty. By the end of his reign, Egg became convinced that the only way he could accomplish his reforms was to recreate the dragons. His pursuit for dragons ended in the Tragedy of Summerhall where House Targaryen barely survived.

---

The Tragedy of Summerhall was first introduced in ASoS by many references from different sources (like Alester Florent to Barristan to even the Ghost of High Heart). Then this backstory kept growing more and more. It is the great finale of the D&amp;E novellas and GRRM conveniently avoided telling what really happened there despite publishing TWOIAF. Hell, even with a Barristan POV, GRRM is still not giving a clue, which I think hurts the story a little. It does not make sense why Dany does not learn more about her private family history, especially the Summerhall stuff, with a witness like Barristan at her disposal. GRRM clearly wants to save this mystery to the D&amp;E novellas.

The first D&amp;E novella, the Hedge Knight, is an oddity. There is no hint whatsoever of the First Blackfyre Rebellion that happened some 13 years ago but it was such an important event and a still standing threat at that time that it should have come up in the novella, especially with some of the characters were present. The explanation is that GRRM had not created the Blackfyre Rebellions yet when he wrote the Hedge Knight.

Finally, I am coming to the title. Leaving the Hedge Knight aside, the other two D&amp;E novellas are all about the Blackfyre backstory, which as I argued above was created with the purpose of fleshing out Dany’s story in the main series. Now consider the Mystery Knight. D&amp;E blunder into a Blackfyre Rebellion by accident. Egg was captured by the indecisive host Lord Butterwell, who had doubts about the outcome of the attempted rebellion. Worse, Egg’s true identity was revealed by his ring. Bloodraven had things under control regarding the outcome of the scheme but Egg’s life was in jeopardy, and maybe far worse troubles were possible if they successfully kidnapped Egg and sent him away to the hands of Bittersteel.

At this moment, the prophetic dream of Daemon II Blackfyre about a dragon hatching at Whitewalls was fulfilled:

&gt; “No, ser. I knew I was in trouble when the maester showed Lord Butterwell my ring. I thought about saying that I’d stolen it, but I didn’t think he would believe me. __Then I remembered this one time I heard my father talking about something Lord Bloodraven said, about how it was better to be frightening than frightened__, so I told them that my father had sent us here to spy for him, that he was on his way here with an army, that His Lordship had best release me and give up this treason, or it would mean his head.” He smiled a shy smile. “It worked better than I thought it would, ser.”

&gt; Dunk wanted to take the boy by the shoulders and shake him until his teeth rattled. _This is no game_, he might have roared. _This is life and death_. 

As Bloodraven explained in the end of the story, the dream was true but Daemon was wrong about the interpretation. His egg did not hatch but the dragon that came into being was Egg, when he lied to Lord Butterwell and intimidated him by appearing sure of himself. Dunk observed a visible change in Egg and GRRM made it appear like a glorious moment for Egg. 

There is still a long way from this Egg to the one who sought the ways to bring dragons so that the Great Lords would submit to his reforms. But the way GRRM explained what it means to “hatch as a dragon” in Egg’s case and how he remembered Bloodraven’s mantra that it was “better to be frightening than frightened”, we can kind of tell how Egg can agree to proceed with whatever controversial thing that was supposed happen at Summerhall. Considering Dany’s final chapter in ADwD where she embraced that “dragons plant no trees” and the show line that “let it be fear”, we can tell that in the books, Dany will lead herself into her own Tragedy of Summerhall, from which House Targaryen might not survive.

When TWOIAF was published, the wishful interpretation was that Dany will succeed where Egg failed and carry out her reforms thanks to her dragons. The show revealed that Egg’s end was not an inversion but a sign of things to come for Dany.",asoiaf

&gt;The afflicted flesh stiffened, calcified, and cracked, though the dwarf had read that greyscale’s progress could be stayed by limes, mustard poultices, and scalding-hot baths (the maesters said) or by prayer, sacrifice, and fasting (the septons insisted). Then the disease passed, leaving its young victims disfigured but alive. Maesters and septons alike agreed that children marked by greyscale could never be touched by the rarer mortal form of the affliction, nor by its terrible swift cousin, the grey plague. “Damp is said to be the culprit,” he said. “Foul humors in the air. Not curses.”
“The conquerors did not believe either, Hugor Hill,” said Ysilla. “The men of Volantis and Valyria hung Garin in a golden cage and made mock as he called upon his Mother to destroy them. But in the night the waters rose and drowned them, and from that day to this they have not rested. They are down there still beneath the water, they who were once the lords of fire. Their cold breath rises from the murk to make these fogs, and ***their flesh has turned as stony as their hearts.***”


The phrase ""stony as their hearts"" caught my attention and a couple paragraphs later...

&gt;“The Shrouded Lord has ruled these mists since Garin’s day,” said Yandry. “Some say that he himself is Garin, risen from his ***watery grave.***”“The dead do not rise,” insisted Haldon Halfmaester, “and no man lives a thousand years. Yes, there is a Shrouded Lord. There have been a score of them. When one dies another takes his place. This one is a corsair from the Basilisk Islands who believed the Rhoyne would offer richer pickings than the Summer Sea.” 
“Aye, I’ve heard that too,” said Duck, “ ***but there’s another tale I like better. The one that says he’s not like t’other stone men, that he started as a statue till a grey woman came out of the fog and kissed him with lips as cold as ice.*** ”

&amp;#x200B;

A bit late in the day, but maybe recommendations on critics of the show would be good too. Sarah Hughes on the Guardian  [https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahhughes](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahhughes) did a good series of columns; conversely I seem to remember one guy on a big magazine's website - maybe Vanity Fair? - who seemed to miss the point egregiously in a desperate effort to make the last season feel bad.

709,"Everyone knows the whole bit about the War of the Roses and other medieval references in ASOIAF, but I see fewer posts pointing out examples of the 18th century references--of which there are several significant ones. For instance, the Blackfyre Rebellions and their similarity to the Jacobite Rebellions, specifically how John the Fiddler in *The Mystery Knight*bears so much resemblance to Prince Charles Edward Stewart (""Bonnie Prince Charlie,"" also ""the Young Pretender""), who likewise appeared back on the scene with only a handful of allies nursing old grievances, tried to rally support for a rebellion that had become tired and unlikely, yet carried on with an almost delusional self-assurance, only to have the whole thing fall apart and meet an ignominious end.

But then there's Stannis, who I think bears a striking resemblance to George Washington, specifically those early years just after becoming commander in chief of the Continental Army. Granted, Stannis is a masterful strategist, tactician, and a seasoned battle commander, whereas Washington made many costly mistakes and poor decisions due to a lack of experience. But aside from differences in characterization, when you look at how the broad majority of characters view Stannis' recent exploits in the North ahead of his confrontation with the Boltons, there are some interesting similarities.

# The Parallels

* Despite some early success, both suffer terrible, costly losses in the early days of their campaign. Stannis loses the Battle of the Blackwater, while Washington [suffered losses at the Battle of Long Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Island) and ultimately the loses New York; both are on the ropes for a bit after that, and need a win in order to stay in the game.
* Both manage to clinch that crucial victory that keeps them in the game, taking a ""savage"" enemy force by surprise. Stannis comes to the aid of the Night's Watch, while Washington's [surprise raid at Trenton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington%27s_crossing_of_the_Delaware_River) marks a turn in the colonists' favor.
* During this time, both are considered underdogs, written off by their contemporaries as not having a chance in hell, *and yet they stay in the game*, gaining momentum with little victories and adapting tactics to deny their enemies their natural advantages.
* Both would be out for the count, were it not for [critical foreign aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_du_Motier,_Marquis_de_Lafayette), and the crucial work of their skilled diplomats who are able to rally unlikely allies to their cause against a common enemy.
* Currently, Stannis is facing a snowy hell and his army is plagued by supply issues, not entirely dissimilar from Washington's [winter encampment at Valley Forge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_Forge), which many thought was the end of his command, if not the entire rebel army. *And yet, they stay in the game*.

# Speculation

Now, much of this could be chalked up to coincidence, but I like to think there may be some intentional parallels dressed up in medieval trappings. After all, for an author who does as extensive of research as GRRM, with the amount of detail he weaves into ASOIAF and the emphasis on logistics, it would make sense that he would seek out 18th century sources; those records are much more recent, accessible, and detailed, with an array of primary and secondary sources, personal correspondences, diaries, and battle records both official and unofficial, to draw from. All one need do thereafter is dress it up with the knowledge drawn from medieval research, and synthesize the two, and [there it is](https://youtu.be/rjA5A86V6SY).

**TL;DR**: Stannis and Washington are both cold, tired, and hungry underdogs who stay in the game despite everyone talking about how any day now they'll finally choke. Any day now. *Annnyyy day*...",asoiaf

Would love to know how other people feel who've read the book and how it shapes their view of the last two seasons.",asoiaf
714,"Because it feels like LITERALLY EVERY SCENE in this past season can be rewritten just slightly to vastly improve on what we've got.

When it comes to other media, when I read fan ideas on how they would change things, I would think ""Oh, that's nice, it really would have tied things together that way"" or ""I get what they're going for, but I still prefer what was actually done"" but with GoT, I'm left thinking ""Yeah, you and everyone else knows that's how it should have been done, but they just didn't.""",asoiaf

After he saves Jon he does not go with him and dies fighting the wights.

So if resurrected men can not go past the wall, what the hell is up with Beric Dondarrion and Jon Snow? George himself has stated that Beric is nothing more then a wight, And looking at Beric, Benjen, and Jon all three of them seem to be the more ""human"" type of wight, but the magic only stops Benjen?

We always hear of the great feats of many around the world, who do you think is the best ever? Where are the greatest warriors located? Is it the Unsullied? Dothraki? The pit fighters of Meereen?

718,"- Dance of dragons happened between a queen sitting at Kingslanding, who had married into Targaryens and the queen who had a more rightful claim, sitting at Dragonstone. The final war happened between  2 queens from Kingslanding &amp; Dragonstone. 

- Rhaenyra died by a dragon Sunfire, Daenerys dies by a dragon, who shares many parallels with Mithras, the sun god, who is following the tale of Azor Ahai the sun killing Nissa Nissa the moon.

- Rhaenyra's Hand Corlys betrayed her because she wanted to punish Addam on fears of turning to greens. Daenerys' Hand betrays her because she wants to punish his siblings Jaime &amp; Cersei.

- Rhaenyra loses a baby because she was poisoned by her enemies. Does this mean something similar to Daenerys? We did see Varys trying to poison her. 

- Alysanne was attacked by the Faith when pregnant. Maegor has a history of conflict with the Faith. Rhaenyra's reign was ended by the Faith storming Dragonpit and killing all the baby dragons. Daenerys likely arrive on the shores of Westeros associated with Rhllor. How will the Faith-Daenerys arc culminate? 

- The North, who were allied with the Dragonstone queen hold the city hostage at the end of Dance. Cregan Stark wants Corlys punished. It ends with a boyking on the throne governed by a council. We did have a boyking &amp; North did hold the city hostage, but our Cregan Stark was himself in chains. How will the hour of the wolf be replicated in the books with Unsullied and Dothraki all in the city &amp; Jon murdering Daenerys?

- Brynden Rivers assassinates Blackfyre on the pretext of a meeting, ensuring Aegon ends up on the throne. Aegon's first ruling is to send Brynden to the Wall. Jon assassinates Daenerys, setting the stage for King Bran, who sends Jon to the Wall.

The below points presume GRRM is still following his original Jon-Arya ending, that Jon-Daenerys will be a political marriage like Rhaegar-Elia, but like his father, Jon will love Lyanna reborn.

- Brynden is in love with his sister Shiera Seastar, who is supposedly Quaithe, Dany's guiding star &amp; travelling across Essos. Jon is in love with Arya, who is now voyaging across the seas like Nymeria. Queen Alysanne built new castles on the Wall to replace Nightfort, there are stories of Lord Commanders marrying and having children. Arya wants to build castles. Does this mean Arya returns to help Jon at the Wall? Does Jon leave his LC duties like Brynden or like Mance to become the King beyond the wall with Arya as queen?

- There was a terrible winter in the years before Harrenhal. Harrenhal occurred in the year of false spring, when everyone was presuming years of prosperity &amp; summer. Harrenhal was the first time Aerys got paranoid about Rhaegar. Rhaegar crowned Lyanna the Queen of love &amp; beauty, over his wife, to acknowledge Lyanna's bravery. Harrenhal ended up being followed by Robert's rebellion, where Vale, North, Riverlands &amp; StormLands rebelled against Aerys. Aerys also gets betrayed by his Lannister Hand.

- There was a terrible winter before the feast of Winterfell. Everyone assumed following the battle for Long Night, they have defeated death &amp; there will be summer. The Winterfell feast where Jon gets hyped over Daenerys is the first time she gets paranoid over people accepting Jon as king, but not her. Following Winterfell feast, the ladies representing North, Vale &amp; Riverlands started plotting to get rid of Daenerys. Daenerys gets betrayed by her Lannister Hand. Does Jon also crown Arya, the girl who ended the Long Night, over Daenerys in a feast to celebrate the end of Winter?

- Rhaenyra wanted to punish Nettles, who had also become Daemon's lover because Rhaenyra was worried, as a dragonseed, Nettles was betraying her. Daemon ended up dying, asking Nettles to flee away, because he wanted her safe. Arya's faceless man arc, is more likely than not, [leading her to sabotage Daenerys way back in Essos.](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/a1suzp/spoilers_extended_will_arya_break_the_peace_of/) Arya's riverland arc is also likely leading her to [sabotaging  Daenerys and forcing her to retreat because of her wolfpack in Riverlands.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9fn5rm/spoilers_main_the_purpose_of_nymerias_wolf_pack/) Their source of conflict will likely be over [who to make the Lord Paramount of Riverlands.](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/a1v227/spoilers_extended_about_those_wolves_in_the/) Daenerys will want to make a Darry, given her Willem Darry was the only positive figure in her life, while Arya will want Edmure's son. When Daenerys realizes it is Arya behind her defeats, will she ask for Arya to be punished? Is this what will convince Jon to kill Daenerys? After all, Jon broke his vows and defected from NW to save Arya. Will he break his vows to his queen and return back to NW to save Arya?

- Littlefinger kills Lysa, his wife and a mad lady, pretending to embrace her, but at the end reveals he only loved Cat. Also Littlefinger also murders Lysa to save Sansa, a pseudo-Cat he loves. Jon kills Dany, his wife &amp; a mad lady, pretending to kiss her. Does Jon murder Dany to save Arya &amp; tell Dany that it was Arya all along?

- While the above parallels are easy to fit into the story we got, one parallel which refuses to fit is Jahaerys' wedding. Aegon had 2 wives, Cregan Stark was supposed to marry a Targaryen, but marries a warrior Black Aly from Riverlands. Rhaegar, while married to Elia, wanted to marry Lyanna, who was loved betrothed to a Baratheon. Aemon was supposed to marry Daenerys, but he ended up marrying a Baratheon girl. Alsyanne was almost betrothed to a Baratheon, but Jahaerys ended up marrying her in secret. Robar storms the wedding, but the deed is done. When do Jon &amp; Arya marry?

721,"Indulge me...this is a follow up post a made last week about how i felt Theon should have been the one to kill the Night King. This is pure FanFiction on what I would have liked to have seen the show do, or something similar. Yes, I know many will find this ridiculous but here goes:

  

As the battle raged around the battlements of Winterfell, Theon and his crew of Iron Born stood in half circle facing the entrance of the Gods Wood with Bran at their back. They fought on – to the man – they fought for pride, they fought for their Kin, they fought for life.

Theon was the last of the Iron Men standing. Bow in hand Theon would not give up; he fought on not acknowledging ache in his muscles and joints from the fury of combat. As the last of the dead was dispatched Theon was given a needed respite. The snow fell around him softly coating the floor of the clearing. The night air was getting colder. He took a deep breath as he turned and looked toward Bran ensuring his charge was unharmed. Brans eyes locked with his for a brief second then shifted over Theon’s shoulder. Theon immediately turned and that’s when he saw them. They strode into the Gods Wood with a calm and orderly approach. At the head of the chain of these otherworldly figures was the one he’d heard so much about. He was gaunt, yet strong, of middling height and build. His eyes were bluer than anything Theon had ever seen. The blue eyes of death; but his visage gave no indication of the malice behind his purpose. Theon was afraid. “Theon”, said Bran. Theon turned towards him not moving his feet. “Thank you, you’re a good man”, Bran said with deep meaning. Theon gave a sad smile, nodded and turned back toward the enemy. He took three slow steps to his left positioning himself directly between Bran and the White Walkers. They reacted to his intent and flared out in a semi-circle toward Theon. Then one of them stepped forward ahead of the Night King. He was tall, and imposing with silky white hair that jostled and fell softly against his head with every step. And the sword, the sword in his hand was beautiful. It refracted the moon light in a manner that gave hint to it’s magical origins. It was mesmerizing, deadly. 

Theon, quick as a cat, nocked a shaft to his bow and fired without aiming, all on instinct, skill, and years of practice. He’d always been much deadlier with bow than with sword in hand. The shaft was fletched with goose feather as is custom for Theon. What wasn’t custom was the arrowhead. Gendry and his team at the forge worked day and night turning their charge of obsidian into swords, axes, and arrow heads. The shot Theon fired was on target…but the Walker was not to be taken unawares. He side-stepped with inhuman speed, shifted sideways and jutted out his free hand and caught the bolt mid-shaft. It froze and crumbled to the ground. All the while not taking his eyes off of Theon. “This is it”, Theon thought. He calmly laid his bow over his shoulder and wielded his obsidian sword.

The walker smiled, a wry, knowing smile. “How can a man be brave if he’s afraid?” a young Bran once asked his father. “That’s the only time a man can be brave”, Theon remembered those words from Lord Stark to Bran. He charged. The battle ensued with Theon and the enemy. He feinted a cut to the right and tried a quick upward slash with his blade. The walker dodged effortlessly and caught Theon by the shoulder and used Theon momentum to send scattering to floor behind them. Theon rolled and rose as quick as he could, but not quick enough.

The Walkers sword came down with rage and lodged itself where Theon’s neck met his shoulder. His shudder was so violent that Theon unintentionally freed himself from the blade. But it was for naught; this was the death blow. The pain washed over him. His strength left him and he fell forward onto his knees as his life’s blood poured from the gash. He didn’t remember dropping his weapons but there they were, bow, sword and quiver strewn on the forest floor. He looked up then through his tears when he noticed that the Walkers were already past him and moving to Bran. He was of no concern to them. They were right; he was done and their target was in reach. He fell face first into the bitter cold snow. He was dying, alone. As he saw his life flow into the snow around him he thought of Yara and her last words to him “What is dead may never die; but kill the bastards anyway”. Theon cried harder and gripped at the snow; his hand found his bow. There was a loose shaft that had fallen from the quiver, he grabbed at it. He was losing consciousness. He rose to one knee barely able to see and make out the figures ahead of him, his vision blurry from the tears and loss of blood. He nocked the bow and pulled it back taut. They didn’t see him and he didn’t see them. Then he saw it ever so faintly that unmistakable shimmer of moonlight from an unearthly blade rising upward. On instinct he released the shaft. It streaked toward the figure holding the blade. The aim was true and the shaft found purchase and plunged itself so deep the Night King could see the obsidian arrowhead puncture out through his breast plate. He never had a chance to bring the sword down onto Bran. The sword fell from his hand as his cold body stiffened, cracked, and fractured away into countless pieces of ice.

Moments later Jon rushed into the Gods Wood, found Bran where he had been posted and to his surprise Bran was unhurt. “What happened?” Jon Said. “It’s over” replied Bran as he led Jon’s eyes to the mound of ice at his feet. Jon didn’t understand. “What’s that?” he said. “The Night King” Bran remarked without emotion. Jon was confused, “But how, what happened here Bran?”. Dawn was approaching. Jon saw an arrowhead in that mound of ice still connected to the shaft. Jon pulled it free and turned it in his hands. He recognized the fletching. “Theon!” Jon called with sudden realization. He turned looking for him and waiting for a reply. He saw Theon laying face down in the snow. “Oh my god” Jon said in a panic as he raced toward him, but it didn’t matter. Theon was dead, Jon knew it. The wound in his neck was terrible and further confused Jon. No one could survive a wound like that let alone continue fighting; how could Theon have gotten the shot off before dying. It made no sense. “He is Iron Born” said Bran. Jon looked at him. “It was the only thing to do, so I did it.” said Bran, “That’s what he said the first time he saved me from Wildlings here in these woods years ago. It was his destiny”. “Destiny?” replied Jon. “Yes”, said Bran. “The destiny of the Prince of Iron Island’s who was promised to Winterfell”, Bran continued, “His destiny led him here, where he needed to be, Home.”",asoiaf

The rebels had House Arryn, House Baratheon, House Stark, and House Tully, which were nowhere near as powerful at the time. I know Robert was a beast in battle, but I don't think any of them were near as genius at military commanding as the Reach lords such as Randyll Tarly. Also, House Lannister pretty much sit the entire rebellion out until Tywin, the awful snake that he is, could assess which side was winning and then declare accordingly.

It would have been even better if Marya would have finaly reunited with Davos and him getting the Master of Ships would have been awesome too. Tyrion could have finally got some good woman with a big name like Hightower or something which would have secured his line and as traditionally it used to happen, a big Wedding in the capital would have also knitted the realm together.

732,"I'm reading TWOIAF and am thinking of making a map of Planetos, but I want to try and make it geographically accurate instead of warped by the maester's perspectives, like we keep being warned that the content we have is. Sometimes it's mentioned how long a dragon took to go from place A to place B, and more notoriously we have the mention that Jaenara Belaerys flew for 3 years over Sothoryos and still didn't find the southern coast.

So what is an acceptable guess of how far a dragon could fly in a day? I imagine they would fly faster when going to war, but maintain a ""cruising speed"" when just exploring or travelling, do we have any estimates to how fast dragons are? I'm guessing that between taking down the camp, pauses to rest, eat and sleep, we could count on 8-10 hours of flight per day, does that seem reasonable?",asoiaf

735,"I finished reading I, Claudius yesterday and I really enjoyed it, but in retrospect, it's written in a similar style to Fire and Blood; presented as a historical document in-universe, being very fact-heavy, and having only a few precise scenes being detailed. 

I don't want to say I didn't enjoy Fire and Blood- it was a fairly good read- but I, Claudius had a far greater impact on me. And I think I've realized why; the narrator.

Fire and Blood is being told by a Maester years after the fact; I hardly think anyone considers Gyldayne a masterfully written or interesting character. I, Claudius is being narrated by, well, Claudius; he is personally affected by the deaths that plague his family. He has enemies and allies and stakes in the narrative. And I, Claudius also contains historical narratives that happened before the titular character was born, and he's still able to offer his opinion on those events.

Now, I, Claudius takes place over about fifty years, while Fire and Blood takes course over about a hundred and thirty; I think we'd need two seperate narrators for it to work, perhaps with one being a mentor to the other?

The obvious Claudius parallel with the Post-Jaehaerys Targaryens is Aegon III; he survives the Dance and was witness to several key events, and has a lot of personal stakes in these events. But I'd personally go with Viserys II, since he has a more academic edge to him and has a badass moment right at the end of the book; a good place to leave if you want a sequel hook. Baela or Rhaena could also work.

For Jaehaerys, I don't really have any idea. Vaegon is a fair proposal, although I don't really think he's involved all that much in the story unlike Viseerys and Aegon. Maybe a non-Targ?",asoiaf

738,"I have seen this discussed in a few places, but never exhaustively, so I thought I would write up the argument because it merits discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

In short: as soon as the show departs from GRRM's completed work at the end of S6 the showrunners moved to strip as many magical elements from the story as possible, and this created a cascading number of plotholes and dangling stories that were patched sloppily. This isn't just a problem about story elements; the premise of ASOIAF is fundamentally ""What if magic returned at the end of the medieval world?"" - and the story trajectory points to the increasing presence of magic in Westeros as we approach the finale. D&amp;D instead stripped the magic from the show while trying to reach the same ending, and it simply didn't work.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the first claim shouldn't be controversial, but just to prove the point, the following are magical elements or characters that vanish or effectively vanish after S6:

* Arya's face swapping
* The faceless men
* Euron's magic and dragon horn
* Warging/Skinchanging - (particularly for Jon, Arya, Sixskins)
* Stannis' sword Lightbringer
* The white walkers other than the Night King
* The magical aspects of the Wall
* The prophecy of Azor Ahai
* The city of Asshai beneath the shadow
* Prophetic dreams
* Magical consequences of human sacrifices
* Quaithe
* Moqorro
* Maester Marwyn
* Bran's ability to affect the past
* And in practice, Bran's visions as wellI know we see Bran mention he's warging or looking into a vision, but the audience no longer follows him into any of these visions.

**edit:** Someone else pointed out, they also cut out Lady Stoneheart

&amp;#x200B;

The only remaining elements are those that were too important to cut, including the wights and the Night King, the dragons, and Melisandre. Even then these elements are downplayed. Note that there's scarcely any mention of the Night King's army after S8E3, just as there's scarcely any on screen mention of Jon's resurrection, or where Bran and Arya have been. Characters seem deeply embarrassed to admit there's magic in their world.

&amp;#x200B;

Stripping these elements creates problems that lead to more problems.

**For example**:

* Euron no longer has black magic or his dragon horn, but the overarching story still calls for him to pose a threat and for him to take down a dragon. *This* is what leads to the bizarre scene where he can seemingly one shot a dragon with the Scorpion, only for it to be useless literally the next time the weapons appear on screen. Without a storyline fundamentally intertwined with magic and the old gods, Euron has nothing to do and becomes a mess of a character.
* Without Maester Marwyn Sam has nothing to do at the Citadel, and the entire storyline about the Citadel's opposition to Dany and her dragon's vanishes as well. This leaves Sam with nothing for the remainder of the show, and his sudden appearance as a Maester at the finale. What happened to the rest of the Maester's in Westeros, and how did he get his chain? It makes sense if this ending builds off a book storyline where Sam stays at the Citadel and the Grey Sheep run into conflict with Dany and her dragons, but it's confusing in the show that paved over these elements.
* No longer allowed to face-swap Arya has nothing to do for the final two seasons. Her storyline of revenge is abandoned and the writers struggle to come up for things for a fan favorite character (and top billed actress) to do. This leads to a lot of confusing scenes with Maisie Williams seemingly aimlessly teleporting.
* And perhaps most importantly, because the audience no longer follows Bran on his visions or on his warging his character is essentially written out of the story. His sudden ascension to King is unsatisfying and, again, confusing.

These are major problems but there are lots of small ones as well. For example, we never get to see Davos admit to Brienne that he helped assassinate Renly - it's an important conversation long forecasted, but seemingly dropped because it means admitting this is a show that once had shadow demons.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ASOIAF almost contains two separate genres: a semi-realistic, medieval political thriller, and high-fantasy legend. GRRM always pays close attention to the importance of space and time, and he segregates these two stories appropriately. The realistic story is both the central narrative and it is located centrally in our world map; this is the story that takes place in Westeros south of the Wall and the nearer parts of Essos, it's grounded in realism and based off real places and events (e.g. the War of the Roses, the rise of the Mameluks and the Khanate's, etc.). The fantasy story is set in the far East and the far North, and contains our dragons, warlocks, shadowbinders, faceless assassins, magic horns, giants, wargs, wights, giant spiders, children of the forests, ancient god magic, etc. It's also the story that focuses on Jon and Dany. And as the story progresses, and as Dany and Jon move closer to King's Landing, they drag magic with them back to Westeros.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*The glass candles are burning. . .""*

That's Quaithe at the end of ADWD. Earlier in the books lighting a glass/obsidian candle is a metaphor for magic, but by the end of ADWD and AFFC it's a literal statement. Remember we see one in Marwyn's study. This is emphasis by GRRM that magic is returning to Westeros as the story draws to a climax. The Damphair's chapter from TWOW seems to point that way as well, by confirming that Euron really has been learning from warlocks. Dany's final chapter in ADWD reminds us that the Valyrian dragonlords controlled their mounts with 'spells and magic horns'. ADWD also takes pain to mention character reactions to Wun Wun as the first giant south of the wall. Throughout the most recent chapters there are repeated mentions of the arrival of magical artifacts and creatures once described as only legends back in GOT.

&amp;#x200B;

If the War of the 5 Kings ends like its historic parallel, we'll probably see fAegon (standing in for Henry Tudor), invading and winning. That's important, because in English history the beginning of Tudor rule is typically held as the end of the Medieval period and beginning of the Early Modern period. Continuing with one of the major premises of ASOIAF, I think fAegon's victory will mark the end of the medieval period in Westeros, and a return to a magical era (and the entrance of Jon and Dany into central Westeros).

&amp;#x200B;

In short I think much of ASOIAF has been leading up to an ending that is *drenched* in high-fantasy magic, as opposed to the ending of the show that was seemingly bereft of it. I think the attempt by the showrunners to keep the ending technically similar to GRRM's ending, while stripping out the magical elements that move us towards that ending, is what left the final two seasons so muddled on the storyboard and so thematically at odds with the momentum of the earlier seasons.",asoiaf

&gt;  
&gt;Simba: How can I go back? I'm not who I used to be.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mufasa: Remember who you are. You are my son, and the one true king.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  
&gt;\[...\] Remember who you are, what you were made to be. Remember your words.

745,"Beyond the obvious riches and power he would gain. At this point in the books, we can infer that the Citadel is operating an old shadow organization of slowly writing out magic while placing themselves as the teachers and all-around intellectuals of Westeros.

I'm also wondering how they might try using the newly armed religious peasantry. 

The Citadel's anti-magic agenda is a direct affront to his rule by magic, achieving this conquest would be the best starting point to his reign. Plus considering his nation worships another god, overthrowing the ruling religious order will deal a blow to the religious opposition. He possibly doesn't know about the religion-fueled armed peasants, or does and wants to take care of it sooner rather than later. Especially since he probably figures the Maesters aren't just erasing magic, but hoarding it too.

746,"I think this would end up resolving a lot of the issues Tywin's character has right now.

1) It would explain why Tywin, who was 31 when Joanna died, never remarried despite his dissatisfaction with his heir and the fact someone like him would have no trouble finding a new wife. Death in childbirth happens all the time in Westeros and everyone seems to get over it except Tywin. Either Tywin, a cold ruthless man who arranges multiple loveless marriages for his kids, is actually the biggest sentimental softy in Westeros, or something else is going on here.

2) It would explain why Tywin continues to blame Tyrion for his wife's death 27 years after it happened despite the fact it's immediately obvious that Tyrion was not at fault. It's projection. He is deflecting the guilt he feels because of his own actions.

3) It would explain Tywin's certainty that Tyrion is not his son, even though Joanna and Aerys had at most one sexual encounter at the Anniversary Tourney while Tywin and Joanna probably had several around the same time. If Tyrion is actually his and not Aerys', he accidentally murdered his wife for no reason whatsoever.

4) It would explain why Tywin didn't abort Tyrion with moon tea or whatever if he had suspicion Tyrion wasn't his. He actually did, and it didn't work. It just hideously deformed him and the complications killed Joanna, and now Tyrion's condition is a living reminder to Tywin of what he did.

5) It would explain why he didn't kill Tyrion immediately after his birth. He tried to once, and it resulted in disaster. Clearly the gods (who Tywin believes in, but hates) punished him for the attempt. If Tyrion is to die Tywin will need someone else to do the deed.

I have a question that has bothered me for a long time by now. If I could, I would ask George directly, but as I do not know how, I want to put it to you out there. Maybe someone can shed some light onto it for me or has information that I overlooked (or knows how to contact GRRM and ask him – that would be best).

&amp;#x200B;

In History / Legend Orys Baratheon – Lieutenant to Aegon the Conqueror – was rumored to be a Targaryen Bastard (probably even Aegons half-brother).

But the Baratheons are always described in a song of ice and fire as tall with black hair. And in Ned’s (and John Arryn’s + Stannis’) investigation of the marriages between the Houses of Lannister and Baratheon, that occurred in the past, the former golden always “yielded” to the latter coal hair.

&amp;#x200B;

**So how does the black hair fit into their supposed valyrian heritage?**

**Where the “original” Baratheons…**

**a)**

a first Men / Andal minor House on Dragonstone or Driftmark, submitting into service of the Targaryens after the establishment of the outposts on those islands? The ending of the name has similarities to Durrand***on*** – Barathe***on***. There could be a connection. Though I have to say, it sounds – at least to me – more Valyrian. (By the way: are the Durrandons first men or of Andal descend?)

&amp;#x200B;

**Or…**

**b)**

where they a minor Valyrian House that came with the Targaryens to the West before the Doom of Valyria? The Name could fit the valyrian name-pattern: Targary***en***, Velari***on***, Barathe***on***. Or was specifically Orys of valyrian descend because of his Targaryen bastardy? Side note: If so, why didn’t he have a bastard’s surname, but rather a noble sounding family name? As far as I know, nothing is known about his mother. Why? And if she was not a nobody, but a Lady of the noble house of Baratheon or Orys was even a “pure born” noble Baratheon, why is nothing known about such a house before him? Questions over questions!

Either way: does his black Hair stem from his non-Targaryen(-bastard) lineage or did Orys have the valyrian silver-gold an does the “coal” first occur in the Baratheon line after his Marriage with Argella, the daughter of Argilac Durrandon?

If the second case is true, this would be an explanation for John Snows non-Targaryen looks: the valyrian gold “yields” exactly like the Lannister gold before the Durrandon/Stark = first men coal/dark hair. Blonde genes are recessive and dark genes are dominant – like in our world.

&amp;#x200B;

I know, this is just a minor detail in the big, big saga that George created, but it really bothered me, so I had to spill it all out. I hope that someone had the same thoughts and maybe has some conclusions / hints for me, that didn’t occur to my mind. The unsatisfying thing is here, that I only can raise questions and don’t really have answers, but maybe you have.

&amp;#x200B;

A roundup of my questions that came with this examination:

&amp;#x200B;

Was Orys Baratheon a bastard or trueborn?

Where the “original” Baratheons of Valyrian, first Men or Andal origin?

Where the Durrandons of first Men or Andal descend?

Are only Durrandon genes or generally first Men / Andal genes dominant and Valyrian genes recessive?",asoiaf

753,"There is still some disagreement on the purpose of the cloak and the GOT music director said that he is going to stay with the wildlings and this is contradicting that but imo these are the reasons why it doesn’t establish anything as to what Jon is doing as to whether he is in the NW or is he with the wildlings. 

1.	Qhorin Halfhand wore the NW garb and he didn’t stay at Castle Black. 

2.	Mance also wore the NW garb except he used to wear the wildlings jacket on top of it. I think this is most likely what Jon will do. 

3.	Jon is a Targaryen and not a Stark. It wouldn’t make sense for him to wear the Stark logo and colours when going out with the    wildlings. NW is a neutral piece of distinct clothing which makes sense for him. It’s also possible that he slightly resents Sansa for what she did and that’s why he wouldn’t want to wear the garb made by her. They most probably didn’t have wildlings outfit at Castle Black as they weren’t expecting him. 

4.	Remember that Tyrion has tricked Jon’s enemies into believing the Nights Watch exists and Grey Worm and the others wouldn’t leave Westeros without ensuring someone keeps checking up on Jon. I find it highly likely that the prince of Dorne and Yara would keep tabs on the NW to ensure he stayed. By wearing the NW uniform, he can keep excusing his behaviour saying that he is on ""official"" NW business with the wildlings and they can’t do anything to him.

759," 

I read an article at The Daily Express that says Daenerys could NEVER win the throne, because her desire for it is basically a curse. They compare the Iron Throne to the One Ring, and show how Bilbo survived the Ring's corruption because of his pity for Gollum. Frodo survives long enough for Gollum's obsession to deprive him of it, or he would have fallen, and they point out Boromir's death after being tempted while Faramir survives because he refused it. Tolkien was definitely creating a morality play.

You know LotR, and we all know GRRM is inspired by it, but the question is, can the deeply allegorical LotR be so predictive of GRRM's much less fantastical ASOIAF? I read the article and for a moment thought, yeah, her blind ambition for this seat of power could be her undoing, but then I got to thinking; this is not at all the world GRRM has made. Good people die and bad people thrive. GRRM loves LotR, but he also thinks it's full of shit when it comes to rewarding virtue. He killed Ned because Ned's actions put him in that position, and no Eagles were going to come fly him away. Tywin thrives because nobody can match his cruelty and only dies because he underestimated Tyrion's pain.

The show has forced me to face the fact that this is not going to end well for Daenerys, and I know GRRM can deliver on her downfall if that's what he chooses, but I would feel cheated if the reason for her complete and total desolation is simply ""She wants something, you're not supposed to want something,"" and we've all seen plenty of arguments against ""he'd be a good king because he doesn't want it.""

762,"So, I just finished re-reading the series and noticed something very interesting in AGOT.
So, when dany saves mirri maz duur and tells her to treat Drogo, she actually does and it seems like genuine treatment - She applied a poultice. It itched and burned - both signs of healing. But Drogo took it off and applied a soothing poultice; she told him not to drink, but he drank. When the wound gets really bad dany again asks for her help again and mirri agrees. She specifically tells dany to let no one enter the tent during her ritual, but jorah grabs Daenerys and gives her to mirri in the tent. When she wakes, she instantly blames mirri for her son's death although jorah tells her he was never born (Which means she had a miscarriage). So dany is furious, sets up the pyre - which is an insane idea only mad Targaryens would come up with  - and puts mirri inside the pyre. She speaks to her in a chilling way, that scares even mirri. And then she goes into the pyre like a madwoman.

My point is dany thought that mirri did kill her husband although Drogo was the one that defied Mirri's orders. Dany thought mirri was responsible for her child's murder although it was jorah who defied Mirri's order. After all that dany thought she was doing the right thing by burning an innocent healer slave alive. It seems to me that she is very delusional and an unreliable narrator since this was just an act of madness. I didn't believe the theory that she is going to go mad but after re-reading the series, there is a lot of subtle hints dropped here and there that might be foreshadowing.",asoiaf

764,"I always found it ridiculous that the Valyrian Freehold is considered Planetos's Roman empire, and not Ghis. In my opinion, Ghis has far more parallels with the Roman Empire than the Valyrian Freehold, in fact I would argue that the Valyrian Freehold is a fantasy empire with no real world analog, like the Patrimony of Hyrkoon (obviously these are are all fantasy empires, however the Valyrians don't seem to match to any real world world empire as well as Martin's other civilizations).

First of all, the Old Ghis Empire started from a single city, old Ghis, similar to Rome, while the Valyrians were wandering shephards. Their military forces were literally called Lockstep ""Legions"", while the Valyrians wouldn't have gotten anywhere without their dragons. Just like the Romans, they also had enormous amounts of slaves.

Like the Romans, they were also incredibly stubborn, waging five wars against an enemy with dragons. Even winning some battles and fighting on despite losing war after war. Unlike the Westerosi (except the Dornish), the Ghis fought to the bitter end against impossible odds, how could an empire that was basically a ""normal"" state win a war against an empire with dragons and magic? It's basically like pitting any real world pre-gunpowder state against the Valyrian Freehold.

Yet whenever I see the Ghis brought up here, people are always comparing them to Carthage, or Egypt, or the Ottoman Empire. It's the Valyrian Freehold thats called Rome. 

Why is this? Is it just because of the Valyrian Freehold's power and influence in Planetos history?",asoiaf
765,"The show directly cut out Valonqar Prophecy. First back in Season 5 I thought they did it intentionally because they wanted it to be more impressive, impactfull when Jaime kills Cersei. They didn't want it to spoil it earlier. So they cut the 'Valonqar' word and 'choking your neck' things out of prophecy. It turned I was very wrong. We are %99 sure Valonqar is Jaime in the books. It is a perfect way to end both Jaime and Cersei's character's arc. I mean If it is not Jaime in the books who kills her, then someone will DEFINETELY kill Cersei in the books. SOMEONE! Not some bricks for god's sake.There is goddamn prophecy and it is happening step by step. She is going to get murdered. That is for sure. Jaime in the other hand...

I've just started reading the books after the end of the show, but I've been spoiling throughout the years thanks to the wiki. I know that Nymeria, after being driven away, has formed a pack of wolves even if I haven't read it yet.

Before being gored by the boar, King Robert was hunting a white hart which was devoured by wolves. I wonder if that was the foreshadowing of Nymeria's pack.

But my real question is (and I don't mind the spoilers) did the pack have a significant impact on the story yet or is it more of a side note to tell us what happened to Nymeria. The first book is pretty adamant about the significance of the Stark children's pets.  I've read that Nymeria drags Cat out of the water (and I know she becomes LSH), but was that it?",asoiaf
767,"  

In the aftermath of the mad queen reveal, I read through the thoughts regarding Dany’s endgame, and it seems that there is this false rumor going around that there is no foreshadowing or build up for her to become a villain in the endgame, and it bothers me because people are completely missing the bittersweet ending of her arc. Not only is Dany the least butchered character but is also the one with the closes adaptation to what I think is her true ending that’s been developing throughout the books.

But since I get downvoted any time I try and defend that claim I decided to put my though into a more coherent form to share how I always viewed Dany, and understood her narrative.

# Words are wind

Among the most common reasons I hear for why Dany going mad makes zero sense, is usually done by referencing something Dany said somewhere in the book or show as evidence for her good nature.

Since Dany told us once that she won’t become the Queen of ashes, therefore the reader/ viewer should take that as solid proof that Dany will never become the queen of Ashes.

Characters say a lot of things, but that is irrelevant to what the narrative shows us. What a character says should not be put on the same caliber as what they do. 

Characters don’t get to decide how things will move, the circumstances decide that.

# Dragons plant no trees.

One of the best scenes of Dany’s story is arguably the death scene of Viserys and it’s foreshadowing that goes largely ignored by the community.

After D&amp;D said how this scene foreshadowed Mad Dany, there has been a huge backlash and posts trying to deny this fact as D&amp;D merely pointing at something at random to push the mad queen plot down our throat.

I think people look at this scene from the wrong light. Mostly it is only viewed as Dany’s triumph over the Villain in her narrative and her abuser Viserys. But I think it does more than just that. 

First of all Dany had moments of victory over her brother already

Once here in *AGOT Daenerys III*

&gt;*""Take his horse,"" Dany commanded Ser Jorah. Viserys gaped at her. He could not believe what he was hearing; nor could Dany quite believe what she was saying. Yet the words came. ""Let my brother walk behind us back to the khalasar."" Among the Dothraki, the man who does not ride was no man at all, the lowest of the low, without honor or pride. ""Let everyone see him as he is.""*

And then once again in *AGOT Daenerys IV* when she pushes back 

&gt;*His fingers dug into her arm painfully and for an instant Dany felt like a child again, quailing in the face of his rage. She reached out with her other hand and grabbed the first thing she touched, the belt she'd hoped to give him, a heavy chain of ornate bronze medallions. She swung it with all her strength.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*It caught him full in the face. Viserys let go of her. Blood ran down his cheek where the edge of one of the medallions had sliced it open. ""You are the one who forgets himself,"" Dany said to him. ""Didn't you learn anything that day in the grass? Leave me now, before I summon my khas to drag you out. And pray that Khal Drogo does not hear of this, or he will cut open your belly and feed you your own entrails.""*

As for the execution scene the last part reveals something important for the story

*AGOT Daenerys V*

&gt;***He was no dragon, Dany thought, curiously calm. Fire cannot kill a dragon.***

**Indeed Viserys is not a dragon, Daenerys is the Dragon.**

A dragon has different variations in fantasy or myth or folklore, but among the most famous is the evil that is slain to bring peace to the realm. I do think there is a more complex built up to Dany being a dragon, as she encapsulates different archetypes of dragons. The archetypes I associate her with are the following:

**#1 a Godlike Dragon (wish granting dragon)**

A dragon that represent a powerful force that can conquers the world.

Dany’s story in the second book has some similarity to this form of dragon, her role as “the breaker of chains” reminds me a lot of this, as she gives the slaves their wish of freedom. One particular attribute also of this kind of dragon is that they have a short temper, kind of like Dany.

This archetype of a dragon sometimes functions as the bearer of the world, similarly we see Dany bear upon her shoulders the troubles of the world and sometimes looks and feels as if she is a goddess.

**#2 The dragon of terror**

This archetype is one that balances the godly with the mortal. It breathes terror and havoc, is a force that feels unstoppable, but it is mortal and humanized, thus fragile enough to be slain. It can suffer even from flaws like greed and anger and is ultimately an obstacle that serves the hero his need. He maybe conquered to be a mount of war, be killed for defying or honoring the gods.

**#3 The Female Dragon**

This is the most destructive form of a dragon. It is usually the embodiment of Chaos and sometimes plays upon the theme of “the absolute evil in a woman’s heart”. In most fantasy the gender of a dragon is female; slaying it is the requirement to bring peace upon the realm.

In some Greek mythology and folktale. A dragon or serpent takes the form of a woman for a man’s love, but is slain when her true form is revealed. This could be similar to Dany’s relationship with Jon as she is killed by him. In the show, the iconic scene of Dany with the Dragon wings is showed to us through Jon’s perspective; this is deliberate as Jon finally sees her true form.

There is an interesting detail here, where the women is reveal to be a dragon/evil all along, not developed into one. This could be important, as Dany may not actually develop into villainy, but rather hidden information is revealed which flips her coin and reveals her in her true form. This could have something to do with the lemon tree, the house with the red door, or even Jon’s true parentage. 

These archetypes might function accordingly to her location. As in our worlds there are different interpretations and views on Dragons as being beast of knowledge or carriers of a great burden, to being the embodiment of chaos, similarly in the world of ASOIAF she will be viewed differently in Westeros than she is viewed in Essos. She is the archetype of the evil dragon in Westeros that needs to be slain to lay the groundwork for a new realm but functions as a wish granting dragon is Essos, and is evoked for such.

One good example I like to bring from the show, as how differently people view Dany the Dragon is during her victory speech after burning King’s Landing to the ground. She first speaks to her army in Valyrian and Dothraki: a foreign tongue to Westeros as our heroes don’t understand her speech, but the Unsullied see her as a wish granter the Dothraki as a conqueror, but the Westerosi (Tyrion, Jon and Arya) see her as a murderer. Once she shifts from speaking to her army to speaking to Tyrion the mood changes as she is to Tyrion the archetype of terror.

Before I move on to the next point, I want to further build upon the importance of the Executions scene. In AGOT we have three scenes where three main characters behold their first ever execution. These characters are Bran (Night’s watch deserter), Dany (Viserys), and Sansa (Ned Stark). 

I talked about Dany’s, and I’m not sure how related Sansa’s is yet, but Bran’s is pretty interesting as it is the first chapter to the story (outside the prologue).

*AGOT Bran I*

&gt;***Bran's bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. ""Keep the pony well in hand,"" he whispered. ""And don't look away. Father will know if you do.""***   
&gt;  
&gt;***Bran kept his pony well in hand, and did not look away.***

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Yet our way is the older way. The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that* ***the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword****. If you would take a man's life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*""One day, Bran, you will be Robb's bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king,* ***and justice will fall to you****. When that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither must you look away. A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.""*

One of the most famous Dragon slayers is Marduk who slays a Dragon and uses her body to furnish the earth. 

Since the reveal that Bran will become King, this first chapter and some of its purpose becomes slightly more intelligible. If Dany is the Dragon of the Story, then that begs to question who will be the hero to slay the Dragon, and since it is Bran who is given the lesson of passing the sentence and swinging the sword, and will become the one to rule the realm, it is highly implied that Bran will slay Dany and Jon is the sword: 

# There are no slaves in Westeros

One undeniable positive about Dany is her care, attention and understanding of the most broken of society, namely the slaves.

Dany has this messiah like presence in that regard, as she helps those who have nothing, and these people run to her feet to receive the love and care they have been starving for their whole life, but there is a flip side to this coin. Precisely because they have nothing these people are easily manipulated. 

Though Dany isn’t dishonest about her care for the poor and the broken of the society, she lacks understanding for most other people, and can sometimes expect devotion from people when she simply didn’t deserve it.

*ADWD Daenerys IX*

&gt;*""Mother!"" they cried instead; in the old dead tongue of Ghis, the word was Mhysa! They stamped their feet and slapped their bellies and shouted, ""Mhysa, Mhysa, Mhysa,"" until the whole pit seemed to tremble. Dany let the sound wash over her.* ***I am not your mother, she might have shouted, back, I am the mother of your slaves, of every boy who ever died*** ***upon these sands whilst you gorged on honeyed locusts.***

One of the moments that go also largely unnoticed is actually the one scene that reveals Dany’s most hidden flaws brilliantly.

*AGOT Daenerys IX*

&gt;*""I spoke for you,"" she said, anguished. ""I saved you.""*   
&gt;  
&gt;*""Saved me?"" The Lhazareen woman spat. ""Three riders had taken me, not as a man takes a woman but from behind, as a dog takes a bitch. The fourth was in me when you rode past. How then did you save me? I saw my god's house burn, where I had healed good men beyond counting. My home they burned as well, and in the street I saw piles of heads. I saw the head of a baker who made my bread. I saw the head of a boy I had saved from deadeye fever, only three moons past. I heard children crying as the riders drove them off with their whips. Tell me again what you saved.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“Your life”.*

I love this scene, because it so perfectly encapsulates how much Dany doesn’t get it. 

MMD lived among the Lhazareen, a society of people that were living peacefully. They were not slaves, and for the most part they were doing fine. It wasn’t until the Dothraki horde came along led by Khal Drogo that they lost everything.

Dany promises MMD to free her if she did as she commanded, and is surprised when her offer of freedom doesn’t fly for MMD, this is because Dany is giving “copper” in place of “gold”. And this is what Dany never understood. Everybody Dany ever helped were ultimately people who came from nothing and had nothing. It was the easiest thing for them to follow her, as she was the only one for them. They had no life, unlike Mirri Maz Durr who had the peaceful life any man can dream of.

*AGOT Daenerys IX*

&gt;*""Three riders had taken me, not as a man takes a woman but from behind, as a dog takes a bitch. The fourth was in me when you rode past. How then did you save me?*

*AGOT Daenerys IV*

&gt;*In one room, a beautiful woman sprawled naked on the floor while four little men crawled over her. They had rattish pointed faces and tiny pink hands, like the servitor who had brought her the glass of shade. One was pumping between her thighs. Another savaged her breasts, worrying at the nipples with his wet red mouth, tearing and chewing.*

Did you catch the similarities?

Both MMD and Westeros (described as a women) are raped and savaged by four men/beasts, as Dany only passes them by.

This whole MMD story is going to happen again in a larger scale as characters take different roles

MMD is a representation of Westeros in the future books. Before the war of the kings, Westeros was doing fine, but now they are starving and dying. Aegon is the one who will bring peace back to the realm prophesied by the visions in the HOTU

*ACOK Daenerys IV*

&gt;*A cloth dragon swayed on poles amidst a cheering crowd.* 

What Dany will bring is an Army and more war, she claims herself as being the “breaker of chains” but Westeros has no slaves, they won’t need the freedom she’s going to offer. 

# Fire made flesh

In a song of ice and fire, Dany has been a character that not only symbolizes fire but also sees herself as fire

*ADWD Daenerys IX*

&gt;*He is fire made flesh, she thought, and so am I.* 

Fire is an all consuming element, which eats away everything it touches, and is a terrible thing to handle.

Though it may symbolize different things in different stories, such as, power and wisdom or what not, in Daenarys’ narrative the destructive nature of fire is undeniable.

This is showed through the many victories that she claims. Spectacular as they may be they are always short lived, as they later have disastrous consequences for all involved.

Astapor is a great example of this. Dany kills the evil masters, frees all the slaves and gets an army of 8000 Unsullied; a spectacular victory indeed, but soon turns to ash, when slavery returns, war and famine grow and her children who fled die outside her wall as she is completely unable to help them.

# Daenerys’ army

One of the biggest hints the reader/viewer should have picked up upon was the army Dany raised throughout her journey to take back the Iron Throne. 

Though on a superficial level, her army is seen as a loyal group that is ready to do anything Dany commands; it is an army completely built for destruction and nothing more.

Three Dragons: Huge beast that are difficult to control, are incredibly aggressive, known for not planting trees, have a special talent in burning and destroying.

The Unsullied: A trained army since childhood on battle prowess, with unquestionable devotion to their leader. Mainly are there to fight and defend. They don’t rape or loot (put a pin on this one it’ really important for Dany’s story)

The Dothraki: The horse lords that are known best for pillaging, stealing, never trading and never building stone houses. Make up where the Unsullied fail in raping and looting.

Sellswords: This one explains itself pretty well. It did not miss my attention that the one part of her army that Dany decided to leave behind in Meereen were the only part of her army that could change sides for Gold or higher promises. 

It looks like an army raised by a villain to me.

# The Iron Throne

In the book the Iron Throne is this massive pile of swords. An ugly twisted blob of a seat that is as uncomfortable to look at as it’s uncomfortable to sit on. It’s even sharp on all edges even where you sit, where any wrong move might get your hand slashed by one of the thousand blades.

The Iron Throne is really just a huge metaphor for the pile of corpses/ broken men you need to climb on to sit as King/Queen

(the implication when people say they wanted Jon to seat on the Throne…)

# The Three treasons

The prophecy of the three treason is actually among the very few places where Dany’s actual madness is going to develop. It is silly to think first of all that GRRM will have Dany consciously thinking about burning people alive. If that’s the development you’re hoping for to convince you of her end as a villain, chances are you will be surprised.

The way George has been building it is through having Dany mirror the Mad King. Dany is constantly worried about those who will betray her, and is trying to always figure out who these three treasons will be.

In my opinion the first treason, treason for blood, was MMD. If that is true then notice that Dany followed by this betrayal decides to burn her alive.

I want the reader to understand, Dany’s madness isn’t in punishing MMD or how she killed her, but that Dany after being left with almost nothing, she follows it by building a pyre and burning thing down. (Remember what I said about MMD and Westeros being the same)

# The bittersweet ending

Now I said earlier that the Unsullied not looting or raping is actually important for Dany’s ending, that is because a huge part of Dany’s story is dedicated to the theme of freeing the slaves. GRRM is not going to simply throw away all that built just for a surprise finale. 

There is a seed he planted early on in ADWD, and the show actually picked it up and adapted it rather well. 

*Daenerys I ADWD*

&gt;""**Even those who lack a man's parts may still have a man's heart, Your Grace**,"" said Grey Worm. ""This one has been told that your servant Stalwart Shield sometimes gave coin to the women of the brothels to lie with him and hold him.""

The eunuch theme in the Unsullied is something interesting, that one doesn’t regard as important but actually ended up playing a big part in Dany’s arc and Grey Worm’s.

There is a connection between the theme of being a eunuch and the Unsullied discipline in never raping or looting, and all of that ties with the theme of freedom. To be a eunuch is to be without desire. They don’t loot because they shouldn’t want the money, and they don’t desire flesh, because desiring is for humans and Unsullied are weapons, they are simply denied the right of being human beings with wants and desires (good they be or bad).  Desires are for the free, not for the slaves.

Dany frees them, but because they know nothing else but to be Unsullied they then have to follow Dany, they are still thematically not free. (contrast this with MMD)

The show builds up on this as they have Grey Worm start developing feelings for Missandei. This is good development for Grey Worm as he is slowly breaking free from his chains, jump forward to when Missandei dies chained, we see the shadow of slavery that still looms above Grey Worm (and by default the Unsullied). When Dany burns KL, it isn’t blind loyalty that drives Grey Worm to continue attacking, but his desire for vengeance. The only thing still holding Grey Worm back from being truly free was Dany and her Iron Throne. 

Even when she won, she wasn't done fighting, meaning the Unsullied were never going to be free. This is why Dany needs to die. Only after her death does Grey Worm and the Unsullied become free. This is what Davos’ “you should start your own house” is about. It’s not that the writers forgot that the Unsullied are eunuchs, but rather that they finally broke out of that theme into freedom.

So well done Dany you did end up doing the one thing you wanted to do: Free the slaves.

# Conclusion 

Dany’s bittersweet ending will play out through her death. She will die a monster, the Dragon upon which the foundation of the new peace will be built, while also will finally free her Unsullied from the shadow of slavery, thus Dany achieves her life goal, with the cost of her life.",asoiaf
768,"If Robert had, for some crazy reason, given Joffrey the name ""Jaehaerys"" instead, would he have been ""Jaehaerys III Baratheon"" or ""Jaehaerys I Baratheon""?

I'm pretty sure in real life, when a regnal name got reused, it would add a number regardless of what dynasty they were a part of, but I'm not sure if it's the same in Westeros. Just curious as to what others think, because I don't know any examples off the top of my head of this sort of thing in-universe.",asoiaf
769,"So this may very well be none of my business, but I've wondered about it for a long time. So please take this as inquisitive more than accusatory.

George has long had an...emphasis, or interest in incest in ASOIAF. The Valyrians, for example, are an empire of strange and gorgeous (but evil) people who habitually marry brother to sister and cousin to cousin but don't seem to suffer the consequences. The Targaryens then continue this tradition and once again, aren't too affected by it. Yes there is the coin flip, but the mad Targaryens aren't born with genetic defects or genuinely deformed. They tend to be people of ordinary health who get out of control after some inciting event. 

This is a bit odd, no? In real world monarchies, incest only really operated at the cousin to cousin level, but it proliferated hemophilia and other disorders, and royals were... pretty ugly oftentimes. The effects of the inbreeding were not favorable. And at the brother to sister level? The reason incest is such a widespread taboo culturally is because it's very unhealthy. Human societies that habitually wed brother to sister for so long would not succeed, they'd be riddled with health issues. Now, it's perfectly fine that George's fictional universe operates differently than ours, but I wonder that this is the alteration he makes.

When we look at the stories he tells in the present day of asoiaf, we have Viserys wanting to bang Daenerys (though he doesn't). Jaime and Cersei are caught in a lifelong, passionate twincest, though it's clear that the relationship is unhealthy and not something to admire (D&amp;D didn't get that). Even Tyrion darkly alludes to wanting to rape his sister from as early as the first book. And most interesting, his original outline had a incestuous relationship that was more appealing. Arya was intended to fall in love with John, be tortured by it, and then at last they would be freed to love once his identity as a Targaryen was revealed. 

Are these plotlines just gritty storytelling, or are they the expression of a fetish, or interest in incest that's more... personal. Is that none of my business, or should we be worried about the ways our favorite writers predilections effect the novels we consume, Quentin Tarantino style. Is all this magical incest really just a theme or a symbolic device that I don't fully appreciate? If so, please explain it to me.

Look forward to seeing what you lot think.

Edit: People in the comments have pointed out lots of cases that I've missed (Craster, Frey, etc.). This has just gone further to convince me that incest has an unusual prominence in the books, beyond the requirements of historical accuracy.",asoiaf
770,"Let me just start off by saying that I am very much of the theory that book Euron is a Greenseer and Warg but rather than go over the evidence that supports this (google Euron Greyjoy Greenseer if you really want to see some), I'd like to ask you a question, ""Let's say you were Euron and you had the power to not only control the weather but warg into any living thing you'd like, what would you do with it?""

I'd honestly warg into and gain control of a Kraken (maybe multiple if I could), not just for branding purposes (being a Greyjoy whose symbol is a Kraken) but b/c Kraken's are remarkably good at pulling down ships in this world

https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Kraken

And what do you know Kraken's have been shown to appear in the summer sea and the broken arm of Dorne (at least in the winds of winter) both of which are relatively close to where the Redywne fleet is believed to be. Also, the Winds of Winter Aeron chapter has two separate dream sequences that link Euron to Krakens. Not to mention Euron is sailing against the Redywne fleet the most powerful Westeros fleet with a total of 200 warships with only 36 Warships (at least from the point of view of Aeron) and a bunch of non-Warships. It seems like Euron would only face such impossible odds unless he had an ace up his sleeve.",asoiaf
771,"This are some thoughts I have on Oberyn's four older daughters, the best known Sand Snakes. I am trying to puzzle them out for a larger theory. All four of them are highly talented, ruthless (maybe not Sarella, she seems a fair minded person and Doran does not see her as a threat), and different from one another in appearance and interests.

Some possibilities:

1. They are his only children that he knows about. He was told about them or found them, collected them, and trained them according to their talents.
2. They are the only children that passed his 'test.' He asks Obara the oldest to choose between her mother and a spear. She chooses the spear. Maybe the others were given similar choices or tests.
3. The top two possibilities but he ignored any male children: he only wanted girls. Why might this be? Prophecy plays a big part in this book, and Oberyn studied at the Citadel and the Free Cities, often delving into the darker arts. Maybe there were prophecies related to daughters. One thing I find of interest is that seven is a very important number in this book-I would expect a prophecy about seven daughters, not eight. I theorize that Oberyn planned to have seven daughters, which may be why he never married- so he could control his offspring and recognize the most worthy. Then he fell for Ellaria Sand, and loving her and wanting to make her happy, recognized her children. Though I can't explain why Ellaria gave birth to only duaghters- she is not the sort to harm or hide her sons.

A second possibility is that he is consciously or subconsciously was trying to make up for his sister Elia- he wanted to raise girls who would not be victims or brutalized the way his beloved sister was.

This of course does not explain Obara, the eldest who was born in 272, and was picked up when she was seven, in 279. Elia was not murdered until 283. This makes me believe that Obara was a fluke, at first he only planned to take one girl on a whim

Nymeria was born in 275, which would make her 8 when Elia died, a good enough age for Oberyn to judge her. I am not sure when she was picked up, but she does seem the most brutal in her desire for revenge, which suggest to me that Oberyn took her and trained her when his hatred was hottest, and that Elia's death may have been the catalyst for continuing his 'collection'. The three eldest all want war, but Nymeria is the most ruthlessly vengeful, or at least he most vocal about it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Nymeria: Obara would make Oldtown our father's funeral pyre, but I am not so greedy. Four lives will suffice for me. Lord Tywin's golden twins, as payment for Elia's children. The old lion, for Elia herself. And last of all the little king, for my father.  
&gt;  
&gt;Doran: The boy has never wronged us.  
&gt;  
&gt;Nymeria: Only royal blood can wash out my father's murder

&gt;Nymeria: It ends in blood, as it began. It ends when Casterly Rock is cracked open, so the sun can shine on the maggots and the worms within. It ends with the utter ruin of Tywin Lannister and all his works.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ellaria: The man died at the hand of his own son. What more could you wish?  
&gt;  
&gt;Nymeria: I could wish that he died at my hand. If he had, his dying would not have been so easy

It would also be interesting if by the time he recognized and raised Tyene, he focus on revenge was cooler, so she picked up on his interest in poisons and deception, rather than combat and straightforward violence.

&amp;#x200B;

4. The Sand Snakes may not be who they claim to be and may not be Oberyn's daughters at all (though I strongly believe they all think they are his blood.) Each of them has an interesting story except for Obara, who was born of a common prostitute. As I stated before, I believe Obara was taken on a whim, with less intense reasoning behind it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""She is a girl,' she \[Obara's mother \] said, 'and I do not think that she is yours. I had a thousand other men.' He tossed his spear at my feet and gave my mother the back of his hand across the face, so she began to weep. 'Girl or boy, we fight our battles,' he said, 'but the gods let us choose our weapons.' He pointed to the spear, then to my mother's tears, and I picked up the spear. 'I told you she was mine,' my father said, and took me.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems that Obara's mother is speaking of 'a thousand other men' in a desperate ploy to keep her daughter, but she is a prostitute- it could aslo be true. Obara has his widow's peak, is about the right age, and his ferocity, so he believes her to be his.

The others are more suspect. It is around this time when he starts 'curating' daughters. He sleeps with many, many women, so it is possible that the girls he chooses are legitimately his own. He may have chosen those with the most potential. Or he may simply have made a study of young girls and chosen the most talented and ruthless to add to his collection- Nymeria the elegant and vindictive warrior, devious Tyene, the Maid, reincarnated with a penchant for poisons, brilliant and androgynous Sarella with a gift for the bow. Their interesting and appropriate parentage- a Volantene noblewoman of the highest blood (which suits Nym's elegance), a Septa (which suits Tyene's supposed gentleness and innocent beauty), and a female sea captain from the Summer Isles (which suits Sarella's sense of adventure and curiosity) only heightens their legend. While it could be true, and this is a fantasy story, the humble origin of Obara followed by the fascinating and spot on origins of the next three raises my suspicion and leads me to believe they too had humbler origins.

Now what about their widow's peaks? A widow's peak may have been confirmation enough that they were his daughters. Otherwise he could simply select girls born with widow's peak (the definition is hazy- Oberyn's is sharply defined, while others may be less so.) Or if he desired very specific girls, his 'daughters' could create a widow's peak by shaving around their forehead, something they would gladly due in homage to their father and to signify their status as members of a group.

One more thing to note is Areo Hotah's observation that they all have the same eyes.

&gt;All of Prince Oberyn's daughters have his viper eyes, Hotah realized suddenly. The color does not matter.

This could negate my theory, but one thing I find strange is he does not mention the shape or any other feature. The unique feature of a snake's eyes is that the iris is usually a slit down the middle- something not very human I think would be highly noted by other characters. I think by Viper eyes, Hotah means a look very specific to the Red Viper, Oberyn, a look of cunning and deception. With their deep admiration of their father, and their rivalry and bond with each other, it is not hard to imagine they would develop similar expressions. It is even possible he has trained them how to use their eyes, much like Arya is advised by the kindly man, to take in information in a stealthy way.

Like most of my theories, I'm not married to this one, but I love the Sand Snakes and am very curious about their origins and what they will do next.",asoiaf
772,"As I'm sure you've all figured out by now, the destruction of the Iron Throne is clearly a reference to the destruction of the One Ring from LotR. It's the symbol of absolute power around which the story revolves, and it has a similar effect on Westeros as the One Ring does on Middle Earth. While many had expected and even hoped that the series would end with the throne being destroyed and the Seven Kingdoms dissolving into well... seven kingdoms. That's not exactly what happened because that was not the point.

**Here is the point:**

The point of the destruction of the Iron Throne at the end of the story is symbolic. It's about what the throne represents, which is not a unified Westeros, or monarchy, or political power, or even House Targaryen, but the idea of *""might makes right.""* Aegon I took the swords of his defeated enemies and forged them into his throne. This makes the Iron Throne a physical embodiment of conquest, domination, and war. It's a literal seat of power built by achieving submission through force.

While the fandom is highly critical of the way the ending was depicted by D&amp;D, going so far as to suggest that it will be totally different in the books, there are some basic concepts which must remain the same.

1. **Neither Bran nor Bloodraven nor ""the COTF"" will warg everyone and force them to submit to the rule of a God-Emperor.** That defeats the whole point of destroying the Iron Throne, as well as of Bran's story. The point of Bran the Broken is that people see value in that which they previously did not value. it doesn't work if they are mind controlled.
2. **Bran will not warg Jon's undead body and use Jon's claim to the IT to become King.** I wrote that theory years ago and idk why it's popular now. It was a clearly incorrect theory. Let it die people.
3. **Bran must be chosen**. Not only is this foreshadowed, but it's the entire point of the ending. The Iron Throne is a symbol of the idea that ""power is power."" That military might makes right, and all authority comes down to the blood of the conqueror. Alternatively, the destruction of the throne and the establishment of an elective monarchy supplants this idea with the basic notion that the power of the monarch comes from the people they rule. Yes, Westeros has not reached a point where all the people can have a say, but it has planted the seeds of that idea by establishing that the power of the King does not come from the might of the King, but from the people's choice.

And yes, I know elective monarchy is not a perfect system. Nor is it democracy. Westeros is not going to be a utopia. There will inevitably be another war of succession. Dorne and the Iron Islands will inevitably secede. Monarchs will inevitably try to work the system to put their own son or chosen successor on the throne after them. But the point is that a precedent is set, the underlying idea the Iron Throne represented is challenged, and the seeds of a more democratic system, and perhaps a parliamentary structure, has been planted.

It will be up to future generations to make any of that work. We don't know if it will or it won't, because this is as far as the story goes.",asoiaf
773,"In addition to Bran communicating with Theon in ADWD, is it possible that Bran is warging into Theon to become the Ghost of Winterfell... Theon is always near the murder scenes but is dismissed as to weak, this would certainly be true mentally but if Bran was controlling him he would be easily overlooked making him a good candidate... Furthermore Bran ii in a AGOT indicates that Bran believes he as a knowledge of Winterfell unparalleled to anyone which would give him the ability to move Theon around undetected.  So yea tinfoil.",asoiaf
774,"And I don't mean the bad dialogue or the rushed execution, I mean like a specific plot point that happened. A lot of people are saying that the plot is fine but it was the execution the made it so bad, and that *is* true for some things; however, there are several things that went down that I would decidedly *not* be ok with happening in the books.

For me, it's Jaime taking Brienne's virginity and then returning to Cersei like it was nothing. I can't see any way to spin this that would make it ok with me.",asoiaf
775,"Hey everyone

Like hundreds of thousands of fans I am anxiously anticipating The Winds of Winter and I am inclined at being desperate at GRRM for being too slow. However I have been thinking about it recently and considered some statistics that show that GRRM is actually not so bad.

The main comparison I thought about is with J.K. Rowling, who is often praised for how well she handled extreme pressure and delivered the last three Harry Potter books in relatively quick succession. But let’s have a look at the last three Harry Potter books lengths and release dates :

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix : 257k words, June 21, 2003

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince : 169k words, July 16, 2005

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows : 198k words, July  21, 2007


So, if we calculate an average writing speed for the last two books we have 367k words in 49 months, an average of **7500** words per month.

The average writing speed for the last three books (624k words in 84 months) is **7430** words per month.

Now, let’s compare to what GRRM has been doing !

A Stom of Swords : 424k words, August 8, 2000

A Feast for Crows : 300k words, October 17, 2005

A Dance with Dragons : 422k words, July 12, 2011


- AFFC (300k words and released 62 months after ASOS) : **4840** words per month.
- ADWD (422k words and released 69 months after AFFC) : **6120** words per month !

We see that despite the many delays, ADWD writing speed was not so far from what J.K. Rowling achieved. GRRM struggled for a year with AFFC before scrapping the five year gap and after that he was not so bad.

Now, how about The Winds of Winter ? GRRM already stated that it will be the same length as ADWD.  If it releases in July 2020, a date GRRM has already teased, the writing speed would be **3910** words per month (422k words in 9 years, so 108 months). 

Yes it’s much slower than before. However, if we consider that GRRM has published Fire and Blood in 2018, that changes a lot. I couldn’t find the exact words count of Fire and Blood but the book is roughly the same size as AGOT (300k words), which would translate into **6690** words per month overall from July 2011 to July 2020 if The Winds of Winter is released in July 2020.

To sum up, I feel like we need to give credit to GRRM for delivering these huge books at such a high quality level. In retrospect, it is really amazing how quickly he was able to deliver ACOK and ASOS. He had some crazy Stephen King’s level of writing speed back then. After that, he delivers slightly less words than J.K. Rowling did with Harry Potter and that is quite something, when you consider his involvement in so many projects.",asoiaf
776,"Mine is "" Lyanna was fond of flowers "" means Walys Flowers slept with Lyanna and Jon is their son . Your turn .",asoiaf
777,"Let's see how much tinfoil we can pack into this short write-up.. Yesterday I made a somewhat offhand comment referencing one of my favorite pet theories, and it got some traction from a number of commenters, so I decided to flesh it out here.

TL,DR:  Varys is a warg that uses the minds of his 'little birds' to personally spy on the realm. He is related to Varamyr, and the ADWD prologue is actually a subtle hint at how Varys is able to use his little birds.

&amp;#x200B;

Many of us suspect that there is much more to Varys than meets the eye. After TWOIAF came out, the ""Varys is a Mermaid"" theory started to gain some traction, and while ridiculous, we entertain these theories because we have strong suspicions that there are secrets yet to be revealed about him. Ned has a strong intuition that Varys is something dark and sinister, beyond his role as Master of Whispers. We are given hints of Varys being involved in magic throughout, particularly through the mystery surrounding his castration and early involvement with R'hollor.

&amp;#x200B;

The prologue to ADWD is perhaps my favorite chapter in all of ASOIAF. Like many others, I've poured over it countless times for hints at Jon's future. However, on a reread I found myself contemplating how Varamyr's difficulties with warging into a human heavily depends on how much 'fight' that individual has against him. The wildling woman he wargs into fights back quite strong. Who would be the easiest humans to warg? We know someone with a mental handicap would struggle fighting back (e.g., Hodor), but what about children? In particular children who have faced trauma early in life (e.g. orphans). Another key idea introduced in the ADWD prologue is that a warg can occupy several entities at once, as Varamyr does in multiple wolves.

&amp;#x200B;

I think Varys preys upon young orphan children, finding those that are mentally weak enough to be warged. He then is able to warg into their minds and listen in on conversation all over ""The Realm."" In this way he is truly like a spider with little birds caught in his web, manipulating and using their bodies for his own enrichment. This would explain his seemingly supernatural ability to get very accurate information from any corner of the realm nearly instantaneously.

&amp;#x200B;

As u/wwwr222 pointed out in a reply to my original comment, Varys is from Myr. Is this a hint at a blood relation to Varamyr? We know that warging abilities can be inherited (e.g. House Stark). Maybe it's spurious, or maybe it's foreshadowing.

&amp;#x200B;

As long as we're reaching here, perhaps his being a eunuch is a hint at how he spends a large portion of his life in the minds of children. His lack of sexual drive would put him right at home in the minds of prepubescent children. Or maybe it's all a front for the fact that mermen don't have human genitals, but I digress..",asoiaf
778,"Everyone talks about Melisandre sacrificing Shireen, and for good reason. But there's another child with King's blood potentially on the chopping block. 

Davos is on a mission to collect Rickon from Skagos and bring him back to Lord Manderly to earn his allegiance. Davos will get Rickon and bring him back to the mainland, but once he realizes Manderly has marched to Winterfell, he will realize the only safe way to transport Rickon to Stark loyalists is along the wall from Eastwatch to Castle Black then south to Stannis' army. What if he shows up at Castle Black only to find Jon Snow is dead and possibly Stannis too according to the Pink Letter? Davos will be crushed, distracting him long enough for Melisandre and the Queen's men to steal Rickon away. 

Rickon is heir to the King in the North, and has magical First Men blood, making him an enormously valuable sacrifice. Valuable enough to, say, bring Jon Snow/Azor Ahai back to life.

That's the end of what I feel confident could happen. My speculation is that perhaps Jon's resurrection is enough to fully convert Selyse and her followers to the Red God and protect Melisandre from retribution from Davos/northmen. Then, when they learn Stannis lives but is in dire straits, Selyse consents to Shireen being burned to ensure victory in the Battle of Ice. The northern lords will be told Rickon was killed on Skagos, and instead start following Jon Snow (who is the true heir to the north per Robb's will). Davos struggles with deciding to tell the truth and losing northern support, or continuing with the lie and never getting justice for Rickon.

Regardless of the details, I feel it makes sense in terms of plot and themes for Rickon to be sacrificed to bring Jon Snow back - it's an easier choice for Melisandre to make, Rickon is a powerful sacrifice, it paves the way for Jon to be the uncontested leader in the North, and it creates a lot of interesting conflicts, especially for Jon once he learns how the ""miracle"" really came about. Let me know what y'all think.",asoiaf
779,"The title seems pretty redundant, we can simply and justifiably say ""D&amp;D shit the bed with bad writing"", or ""there was not enough time in season 8 to flesh out the story"" or ""D&amp;D needed the books for guidance"" or ""season 7 dropped the ball so badly there wasn't enough time in season 8 to fix it"" --- or some combination of all of these. Cinematography, acting, music, cgi, editing, generally all the other major components are in great shape, so the blame must be squared onto D&amp;D.

However, in practice those answers tell us 'what went wrong', when to me the more interesting question is, why did this happen? Why was the show allowed to get into this state of disrepair?

Again, you might find that pretty redundant. It went wrong because D&amp;D can't write well, can't plot out a narrative properly, etc. Without trying to deflect blame away from the now-infamous duo, it is interesting to step back and really think about the many components that led to the disaster that was season 8.

* Were D&amp;D given too much power? Did it become impossible to question them considering their success? Or did people actually raise issues and get shot down by D&amp;D?

* Were Executives and D&amp;D's underlings simply overawed by the showrunners, a kind of a ""I don't know what they're doing but they must be doing something right"" situation? Were checks and balances removed for this reason?

* The one I really would love to know more about: How did they go about organising their fan service for season 8? Did they create a kind of 'multi-verse' situation, where the show went waaaaaaay above and beyond the amount of content that is normally created for a season, and then picked between what goes into each episode based on testing? So much of season 8 felt like fan fiction, could the explanation be that they (in a much more direct, expansive way than you typically see) choose scenes and plotlines based on audience testing?

With all the complaining and criticism the show has rightly deserved, it's the ""why"" rather than the ""what"" that remains unanswered? Why did it go so very, very wrong?",asoiaf
780,"We see Mushroom as a dwarf throughout Fire and Blood who was the court fool during the reigns of Viserys I, Aegon II, Rhaenyra and Aegon III who wasn't just a court fool but actually a very clever person who also had information which he listened while entertaining people who was also very close to Rhaenyra.

Throughout Fire and Blood we see the history through the Citadel version and it is repeatedly compared to that of Mushroom which always was some weird one or as many believe, the real account of what happened. Even if he was a court fool, he was very cunning too and was Rhaenyra's counselor.

&gt;Only I could lighten Her Grace's heart. In this dark hour, I became the queen's counselor, setting aside my fool's sceptre and pointed hat to lend her all my wisdom and compassion. Unbeknownst to all, it was the jester who ruled them now, an invisible king in motley

And this isn't just him bragging, he did give some good advice too

&gt;**Joffrey**: Mother, what if they kill Tyraxes?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Rhaenyra**: They are vermin. Drunks and fools and gutter rats. One taste of dragonflame and they will run.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Mushroom:** Drunks they may be, but a drunken man knows not fear. Fools, aye, but a fool can kill a king. Rats, that too, but a thousand rats can bring down a bear. I saw it happen once, down there in Flea Bottom

There are many instances where the actual thing and the story shown are two different things like Ned wasn't a traitor but through the eyes of everyone else, he was. So what if Tyrion is like the present day Mushroom? Even if it can be purely show only, what if the exclusion of Tyrion in show!asoiaf means that in the book Citadel version of asoiaf will have Tyrion but his account will be shown how Mushroom is?

Like for example in this scene:

&gt;""As you will,"" Ser Alliser said, displeasure in every word. ""I am sent to tell you that we found two rangers, long missing. They were dead, yet when we brought the corpses back to the Wall they rose again in the night. One slew Ser Jaremy Rykker, while the second tried to murder the Lord Commander.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Distantly, Tyrion heard someone snigger. Does he mean to mock me with this folly? He shifted uneasily and glanced down at Varys, Littlefinger, and Pycelle, wondering if one of them had a role in this. A dwarf enjoyed at best a tenuous hold on dignity. Once the court and kingdom started to laugh at him, he was doomed. And yet . . . and yet ...

We see here that no matter how insane it sounds, Alliser Thorne was correct here, and if Tyrion agreed to this then as he said that everyone would mock him which makes him very much like Mushroom who was all for the truth and would have probably agreed to Thorne

That's why I believe that Tyrion is like the present day Mushroom where both of them are pretty clever and witty and actually try to tell the world the correct version of events but are only ignored because of their appearance and telling the actual truth which sounds bizarre",asoiaf
781,"Sorry for posting again. Original thread got removed, [here's a link to it](https://np.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/bzxqky/spoilers_extended_tywin_lannisters_stinking_body/) to it, if that works - lots of good replies there. 

The mystery of why Tywin's body stunk so much when it laid in the sept remains unsolved. Some people have suggested that he was poisoned by Oberyn Martell, [but that's been debunked already.](https://youtu.be/tcUE-gtzajI) So, did he stink so much because he was just this rotten in life? That's what the superstitious people of Westeros think.
But this doesn't add up either - in GRRM's world, things behave as is expected of them, unless there's magic involved.

Preparing a body for burial is the task of silent sisters. They are described to remove a body's innards and stuff it with fragrant herbs and salts. Did they botch the job for the first time in whomever knows how long? Even if, how did they botch it so hard that Tywin's body released an odor so foul that it made women faint? That his skin was cracked and oozing some disgusting liquid? That his lips were curved upwards in a light smile?

Perhaps they did it on purpose. But why? What motivation would they have? Let me explain.

When dealing with the Reyne-Tarbeck rebellion, Tywin Lannister captured the last remaining Tarbeck women, and instead of killing them like the rest of their family, he forced them to join the order of silent sisters.

&gt;""[Ellyn Tarbeck's] daughters Rohanne and Cyrelle, whose husbands had been beheaded with Lord Walderan, were taken alive, and spent the remainder of their lives with the silent sisters (accounts differ as to whether Ser Tywin first had their tongues removed).""

Tywin was nineteen at the time of the rebellion, and he died an old man. Those daughters had time to grow, and become skilled at their craft. Perhaps they were respected enough to personally take care of delicate work like handling bodies of lords. Lords like Tywin Lannister. They were powerless to hurt him in life, but at least they could take his dignity in death.

TL;DR: The last surviving Tarbecks, serving the silent sisters, made Tywin's body stink as revenge for killing their family.",asoiaf
782,"Some people claim that every character in ASOIAF has a darker side and most characters are morally grey. While I agree that most characters are somewhat grey there are plenty of people who fall more into one side of the spectrum.

The focus normally is on the bad or somewhat shady characters but throughout my last reread I made a list of people that I find more morally white or good than grey.

Basically this is just one large appreciation post.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Tommen Baratheon: just a sweet kid that wants to rule well and help the smallfolk

Garlan Tyrell and Leonette Fossoway: galant and nice to Tyrion, everything we know about him screams greatness

Edric Storm: bit of a hothead but in general a nice kiddo

Controversial picks:

Tytos Blackwood, Jonos Bracken, Pycelle, Dagon Codd and the Moat Cailin defenders, Big Walder Frey, Lord Peasebury, Morgan Liddle and most of the sellswords

That list became a lot larger than I intended. Who is missing? Because a friend of mine is lending ACOK I haven't been able to reread that one so there are most defenitely some people missing.

Anyway these are a whole bunch of characters that I think are pretty nice people who I am always happy to see in the books. I hope most of these (who are alive) will have a somewhat happy ending",asoiaf
783,"I mean, from what I can tell the world has been set in its ways for thousands of years with hardly any change. The last major change technology wise seems to be the andals arriving and using iron swords instead of the bronze used by the first men at the time. With all the measters in the world and all the incredible things that have been built (the wall, the Hightower, pyramids of Meereen etc) it’s seems crazy that no advancements have been made. 

Not even just in Westeros. YiTi is suppose to be far superior. Their ruler lives in a palace the size of kings landings. To me it just seems crazy that not one of these civilisations has advanced any more in thousands of years.

Note: I’m looking at this from a lore perspective. This isn’t me saying how it doesn’t make sense that it’s still in the era it is. I’m just curious is there is any reason it hasn’t happened yet and what are the chances of it happening in the future.",asoiaf
784,"I see a lot of theory/speculation that in the books it will be revealed that Bran/Bloodraven/COTF will have engineered all of the events of the series in order to become King. In these theories Bran/Bloodraven/COTF is an evil being, and being named king is its/their ultimate victory. This raises a few questions for me:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Assuming the major beats of the show happen the same as the books, we are going to have Dany burn King's Landing, Jon will kill her, then Bran/Bloodraven/COTF is named King and Jon is banished to the Night's Watch/Beyond the Wall. How is this ending ""bittersweet""? If Bran/Bloodraven/COTF is a malevolent being and is named King, while our heroes end up dead or in exile, that isn't bittersweet. That is dark as fuck. 
2. What evidence is there that Bran/Bloodraven/COTF are evil (or just want to destroy/rule over man)? The COTF have been hostile to man before, but the COTF has also allied with man to fight the Others, and to fight the Andals. Bloodraven is a mysterious figure, and has become one of the most intriguing characters in the series for me after reading The Mystery Knight. But I've never seen him as evil.

To me, I think it's pretty much canon that Bran will be King at the end of the series. But I also don't think it will be a negative thing like some around here think. I think it will be more positive like in the show. I don't think it will be revealed that Bran/Bloodraven/COTF engineered everything for this to happen, and I don't think it will be revealed that Bran/Bloodraven/COTF are evil or antagonistic to man.",asoiaf

788,"First off, I realize this theory may be a little out there, but please bear with me, as I am convince of it's authenticity, and by the end of my argument, I believe you will be as well.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, to understand the real identity of the Great Other, we must first look at the dichotomy between him and Rh'llor. As we know, Rh'llor is all about light, and fire is his champion.  This is represented with the likes of Melisandre and Thoros of Myr, red priests who worship Rh'llor, and through the use of fire, they serve him in the novels and show. None of this is directly in dispute, and so we will use it to further out theory.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, we need to ask ourselves an important question. If Fire is the Champion of Rh'llor, the God of Light, what is the champion of The Great Other, the God of Darkness? I know most of you are gonna answer with the generic ""Ice..duh. Are you stupid"". BUT THINK ABOUT IT. Ice isn't dark, and it doesn't put out fires. What fire god would be lame enough to be afraid of fucking ice? But if Ice is not the opposite of fire, what is?

&amp;#x200B;

The obvious answer... is water. Think about it. What god of light and fire WOULDN'T be afraid of water? Water is cold, and wet and... DARK. Now bear with me, as this is where I think some skeptics may doubt my sound logic. What god represents water is ASOIAF? The answer is right in-front of your stupid face.

&amp;#x200B;

You're right.. The Drowned God.

&amp;#x200B;

It makes perfect sense. People who are 'drowned', are killed and brought back to life. Instead of Rh'llor's Kiss of Fire, where the lungs of the dying are filled with fire and they are brought back to life, we have drownings, where men are shoved into the dark of the ocean depths and their lungs fill with water, BEFORE BEING BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE. Mind=Blown.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT is the Drowned God really what we think he is? I submit that the Iron Born are all idiots, and therefor they have probably bastardized the Drowned God into thinking it's all about them. BUT IT'S NOT. Many have likened the Drowned God to being similar to Cthulhu, so we must assume he looks like Cthulhu. Need further evidence? What does the name Great Other remind you of?

&amp;#x200B;

That's right, it's the Great Old One from D&amp;D 5E. Guess who the Great Old One in D&amp;D is supposed to be? Fucking Cthulhu. Crazy shit right? IT JUST GETS BETTER.

&amp;#x200B;

We've now established with 100% certainty that The Great Other is actually The Drowned God, who is actually Cthulhu.

&amp;#x200B;

Time to look at our second major piece of evidence. This is a small point, but important......    D&amp;D.

At this point we have thoroughly established that The Great Other is The Great Old One, created by D&amp;D. Why would GRRM throw this subtle hint at us though? The answer is right in front of your ignorant faces.

&amp;#x200B;

D&amp;D = DnD.  It makes perfect sense. D&amp;D created the Great Old One... and DnD created the Great Other. But what does that mean? Ask yourself... what are DnD known for? Obviously for being mediocre and disappointing. This is my second point. DnD = Disappointment. This may not make sense yet, but it will soon..

Enter the third and final piece of the puzzle.... Throughout ASOIAF, a single theme has secretly been repeated over and over and over, and you didn't even notice it. Be ashamed of yourself. I am.

&amp;#x200B;

What is this hidden theme? You guessed it.. crabs. Think about it. Think of all the crustacean references spread throughout the novels? Nimble Dick Crabb. Sir Clarence Crab(Obviously the Great Other's equivalent to the PtWP). Crackclaw Point, the Bay of Crabs, Claw Isle, HOUSE CELTIGAR with it's fucking Crab Sigil. References to crabs are spread throughout all five of his books... but why?

&amp;#x200B;

This is where we take our three puzzle pieces and put them together. What do we have? Something that resembles Cthulhu. Something consistently mediocre and disappointing... and Something Crabby.... Ask yourselves. What's the one thing that fits all three of those characteristics? The answer may surprise you... it may shock you, but its obviousness is indisputable. To find the answer we must simply look at Cthulhu's face in like every artists rendition ever. What do you see? Face Tentacles. What else has face tentacles? What else is consistently disappointing? What else...is crabby?

&amp;#x200B;

The answer, ladies and gentlemen.. is Zoidberg. Zoidberg is the Great Other. The evil enemy of Rh'llor. The Drowned God.

I've 'cracked' the code. (crab joke)

In the ending scene of *Game of Thrones* Jon is shown riding to the future, starting a new life beyond the wall, surrounded by lots of Wildling families, and accompanied by Tormund and Ghost.

Is it possible that Val, the lovely lady who took on the  mission to  bring Tormund and the remaining wildling families to safety in ADWD, will play a part in that future in GRRM's saga?

Could this exchange be a hint of things to come?

Val was clad all in white; white woolen breeches tucked into high boots of bleached white leather, white bearskin cloak pinned at the shoulder with a carved weirwood face, white tunic with bone fastenings.

793,"Look, I know doubting GRRM is like a christian losing faith in god, but I just can't help but think... Will the Long Night in the books be THAT much better than the show? I just look over it again and again and I'm coming to the conclusion that all the hype of the Others will not be something that will be met and that just like in the show, it will be over in a single night. Look, I assume that in the original Long Night, Westeros was plentiful and unified against them and it STILL nearly killed everyone. The army of the living will not only be divided, but also minimal after all the wars that's occurred. They literally can't retreat, it's as others have said about people rewriting the Long Night: the concept of the living actually retreating from them is dumb as well. It's been constantly said that you can't run from them, it's impossible to do so as they don't tire. Because of these facts, in the end, the Long Night HAS to be finished in a night. It can't be any longer than that, especially not when the aftermath is still going to happen with Dany going crazy.

Also, part of the reason why I think about this is because mainly Dany's dragons. I assume that Dany will fight them in the books as well. The original Long Night, dragons didn't play any sort of part or role on either side. They'll be what helps the living here for sure, at least moreso in the books than in the show.",asoiaf

796,"In Game of Thrones, Robb Stark is killed when he's stabbed in the abdomen.  Talisa Stark is also killed when stabbed in the abdomen.  It's implied that Jaime is mortally wounded when stabbed in the abdomen.  The Hound mercy kills a man who was mortally wounded when stabbed in the abdomen.  Arya kills a stable boy when she stabs him in the abdomen.  Both Theon and Euron Greyjoy die when stabbed in the abdomen.  And in the series finale, Dany dies seconds after being, you guessed it, *stabbed in the abdomen*.

Then we've got Khal Drogo, the baddest of badasses in the show.  He dies to an infection suffered from a seemingly minor cut.

And that brings us to Arya, who was stabbed multiple times in the abdomen before jumping into an open sewer to escape her attacker.  The stab wounds don't kill her.  The infection gained from swimming through a filthy canal with a perforated midsection doesn't kill her.  In fact, she's up and running parkour just a day or two later.

Killing those two would make his war effort much more difficult, as he'd be the sole focus of the crown.

805,"Obviously, it's pretty much accepted that some of the show's ending is the book's ending, at least for the main characters. So my question is, who exactly *are* the main characters of the story? If we go by GRRM's original outline it's the Starks (Sansa, Arya, and Bran), plus Jon, Tyrion, and Daenerys. If we go by who gets POV chapters in the first book and is still alive, the list is the same. But we're going by amount of POV chapters it's Tyrion, Jon, Arya, and Daenerys, then it's Catelyn (who I think most will agree isn't a main character), followed by Sansa and Bran. So could Sansa and Bran be considered more secondary characters because they have fewer chapters? And Cersei isn't even included in this list at all even though she anchors much of the KL plot.

I guess the main people I'm confused about are Jaime and Cersei. They both are huge players in the books, but the show cut out some individual plot lines and details, not to mention that their ending was kinda wack, which makes me think that GRRM *doesn't* really consider them to be main characters. But that seems impossible given how important they both are...

Not to mention Theon, who has more POV chapters than Cersei but I've always considered to be less important to the overall story than her.

And while Bran being on the Iron Throne in and of itself doesn't seem odd to me, GRRM giving away the ending of basically biggest plot point of the books *does* seem somewhat odd to me.

807,"I know, I'm tired of discussing the show's plot holes and mistakes, but this is something that's been bugging me and I haven't seen discussed yet. The show deliberately whitewashed not only early season Daenerys herself, but also all of her advisers and friends, which I think contributed to why her descent to madness in the show was much less believable. Because in the books, she is very reliant on her advisers, and her advisers aren't particularly good people.

* **Daenerys:** One of my biggest faults with the show is how they never depict the damage Dany causes in Essos. She turns Astapor into a living hell and causes the deaths of millions across the continent, and for what? Westerosi feudalism is scarcely a step up from eastern slavery, and certainly wasn't worth the harm she causes. But in the show, we never see that. Mereen and Essos are all wrapped up nicely, and given that we never hear about them again we're meant to assume that they remain free and well functioning, even though that makes no sense.
* **Jorah:** Almost an entirely different character from book to show. I actually like both versions of Jorah and think he was well done in the show, but this change was impactful. In the books Jorah is guiltless; rather than feeling ashamed for his past actions like in the show, he feels angry at Ned Stark for wanting to execute him *just* for selling slaves. When Danaerys confronts him about his spying, she wants and plans to forgive him, but he refuses to apologize and pridefully demands that Dany pardon him regardless. And of course, his affection for Dany is much less admirable in the books. Opposite to Iain Glen's gentlemanly depiction of Jorah, in the books he kisses and gropes Dany against her will and tries to coerce her into being with him, despite her being 14.
* **Tyrion:** Now, Tyrion hasn't even met Dany yet in the books, but he's her principle adviser in the late seasons of the show so he's worth discussing. Tyrion's book counterpart is far more ruthless and Tywin-esque in his decision making, much darker than his amiable show rendition. He kills a singer and has him mixed into a stew to be fed to the poor. He initially tries to have sex with Sansa, rather than outright refusing to like in the show. He drunkenly rapes a slave girl in Essos. His murder of Shae is much less justifiable in the books, because it's clear she's just a prostitute doing her job and doesn't feel anything more for Tyrion, and because she doesn't try stabbing Tyrion like in the show, which made it self defense. He also has very twisted thoughts about raping Cersei and suicide, amongst other things, and his depression is much more potent and lasts longer in the books.
* **Varys:** Another one of the most changed characters, and much for the worse. The show makes him this wishy washy yet noble utilitarian who cares only for the greater good of the common people. He's the perfect adviser: he's not only an experienced political genius with the greatest information network in the world, but he's also an ethical person with no personal desire for power. He's entirely different in the books; he has his own personal agenda, which he pursues ruthlessly to further his own ends. He was willing to start a proxy war between Dothraki and Westerosi merely to weaken the region and take control himself. He cuts the tounges out of hundreds (if not thousands) of young children to use them as his spies. He murders Kevan and Pycelle because he knows they could be the start of a peaceful regime and that goes against his plans.
* **Hizdahr zo Loraq:** The show rendition of Hizdahr actually seems to be a fairly decent guy. We have little reason to doubt his good intentions, and if anything it is Daenerys who mistreats him a great deal. It is Dany who forces him to marry her, after she unjustly crucified his father. In the books, Hizdahr is much more of an active player in the game of thrones. He pursues Dany's hand in marriage out of desire for power, and seems a rather corrupt ruler in the period we see him on the throne. He also appears much more foolish in the books, whereas in the show he gives Dany generally good advice
* **Barristan:** This might be a controversial take, but I don't think Barristan is necessarily a good person in the books. He is a powerful weapon that blindly allows himself to be wielded by any ruler who wishes. He fights for the Mad King, then for Robert, then for Cersei/Joffrey, and then for Daenerys, only the last of which came out of a real conscious choice. His POV chapter in Dance made clear to me that he lacks the proper judgement to determine right from wrong in political situations; all he really understands is how to fight, and he lets himself be used for war even when he isn't necessarily fighting for good. The show offers none of this depth about Barristan; he is merely a good, noble old knight.
* **The Ironborn:** In the show, Dany allies with Theon and Asha, who actually act like decent people at least from that point onwards. But in the books -- although we haven't gotten to it yet -- it seems likely that Victarion will be the Ironborn she makes her alliance with, and Victarion is obviously a much worse person. He's brutal, savage, lacks intelligence and has little empathy for mindlessly slaughtering human life.

This is why no one found it believable when Dany just turned evil in two episodes. The show writers deliberately whitewashed her and all of her closest friends and advisers, taking away all their bad/gray qualities and making them these wholly good people for most of the series, so for her to become evil all of a sudden was ridiculous. Whereas in the books, it's not difficult to see how a young girl in her position of power with such questionable advisers would go down a darker path in war.",asoiaf
808,"I was reading the chapter in ASOS when Davos is raised to Hand. For some reason this passage jumped out at me.

""Davos knelt, and Stannis drew his longsword. Lightbringer, Melisandre had named it; the red sword of heroes, drawn from the fires where the seven gods were consumed. The room seemed to grow brighter as the blade slid from its scabbard. The steel had a glow to it; now orange, now yellow, now red. The air shimmered around it, and no jewel had ever sparkled so brilliantly. But when Stannis touched it to Davos's shoulder, it felt no different than any other longsword.""

There are several times in the books where the sword Stannis carries that Mel calls ""Lightbringer"" radiates no heat. Is this because it's just a glamour? We know that Mel has the ability to do this with people (Rattle Shirt/Mance) but could she do it to an object? 
The other question would be what purpose would it serve her to create a fake Lightbringer? 
1) To further strengthen Stannis' faith in R'hllor.
2) To get Stannis to believe in himself as Azor Ahai reborn and his duty to stop The Long Night.
3) To help convince men to follow Stannis and believe as he does about the need to stop The Long Night etc.

811,"Edit: I was wrong and this whole post is dumb

Edit 2: FUCK YOU I WASN’T WRONG BITCHES

It was pointed out that Tyrion actually did tell Bronn he’d pay double, and everyone who said that was 100% correct. But I’m halfway through a rewatch now and the “double” people are referring to happened in S03E01, where Bronn’s complaining about not being paid enough as Tyrion’s bodyguard, and Tyrion agrees to pay him double. That’s Bronn’s salary, that’s completely different.

Unless there’s somehow a later mention of Tyrion paying Bronn double whatever would-be betrayers are offering, my original point stands, and I was right: The show really did mix up the lines re: Tyrion‘s original offer about being betrayed: “whatever their price, I’ll beat it” (actual line) vs “whatever their price, I’ll double it” (what the show eventually assumed the line had been).

Interestingly, in the books the line is 
“If the day ever comes when you’re tempted to sell me out, remember this, Bronn—I’ll match their price, whatever it is.” (GOT, Tyrion, pp. 629-30)


 Tl;dr, I was right

With that said, the comments calling this post worthless overall are hard to argue with, but goddamn it I wasn’t wrong after all (see tl;dr). I’m glad 0-3 people might see this now and know that I am become vindicated.

Original post:

Specifically, Tyrion’s S01 preemptive betrayal-insurance offer to his new pal Bronn:

—S01E08 - The Pointy End

Tyrion: “Though I would treasure your friendship, I’m mainly interested in your facility with murder... And if the day ever comes when you’re tempted to sell me out, remember this: Whatever their price, I’ll beat it”.



—S08E04 - The Last of the Starks

Tyrion: “We made a deal long ago; do you remember?”

Bronn: “If anyone offered me money to kill you, you’d pay me double.”


Hold on - 

It makes sense to remember the offer as “I’ll double it” - that’s what S08 thought it was, that’s how I remembered it; Google it, that’s how everyone remembers it. But Tyrion never said that shit. He said “Whatever their price, I’ll beat it”. 

That means D&amp;D, when writing the final few episodes of this cultural behemoth of a show, were totally content to use “pretty sure that was it” to keep things together - in other words, they winged it. They knew it was a callback, that was the point. What does it take to check the line, six seconds?

No, they just kinda forgot, so now in S08 both characters are shown solemnly sharing a memory about a line that no one ever said. And then Bronn uses it to negotiate (“What’s double Riverrun?”, etc).

Of course it’s nitpicking, but in another way it really fucking isn’t. It’s like the coffee cup in the shot, but it’s IN the SCRIPT. They can’t go back and edit it out like they did with the cup. It will stay there forever, a telling flaw embedded across eight seasons of show, mocking HBO for putting too much faith in a pair of pretentious low-effort same-named dunces.",asoiaf

Well, there is a species of fish called wolffish which is also known as seawolf. A ‘sea wolf’ is also a metaphor for a dangerous person who fights at sea. 

It looks GRRM planted the seeds of Arya having a bigger role in the sea since her very first chapter. It goes well with her water motif and her foreshadowing for sea monsters.

816,"He says he has discussed Jon Snow’s ending with D&amp;D. 

Renfro: Did you have any conversations with showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss about what is going on with Jon specifically? I feel like the shows ends on this optimistic note, where he's half-smiling and there are children around him. The children's presence felt really important in that scene, because it's this mark of the future and possibility. At the same time it's a little sad, because he's going into exile, basically, and leaving behind his past life. Were there conversations about that?

Djawadi: Yeah, absolutely. The idea is really that he stops and he looks back, and then the main title starts, and it's the idea of a new beginning. It's supposed to be positive and yeah, like you said, the fact that there are children around and [other] people — he's not just by himself.

Djawadi [continued]: Originally [he was] with the Night's Watch, and you're not allowed to have a wife and children and all that, but this is him going out there with the wildlings, and you can interpret it like he's starting a new life. He's a changed man, and he's leaving the past behind, and so it's definitely supposed to be something positive. There are many possibilities now — that's how we can look at it.

817,"I am sure this has been brought up before but it is hard to find using search terms.

In the war of the five kings I'm not always a fan of would've should've could've, but in ACOK during Cat's parlay an obvious solution was never brought up. Stannis hates the Lannisters, who he considers abominations, more than the Starks. Renly is less emotionally invested in the Lannisters and Starks and just wants to be King. He may also want to delay killing his brother before it is completely necessary, and Stannis might hesistate to kinslay as well if there was another option. 

Why didn't Catelyn ask for a temporary alliance- they would fight and defeat the Lannisters before they fought each other, or at least not fight Robb until the Lannisters were defeated? Renly would still have the greater army so he could hope to defeat Stannis afterwards, and Stannis, who considers himself a just man, might hope that something would happen to Renly without his involvement. Either would have the strength of the Iron Throne afterwards to defeat Robb.

This may or may not have prevented the Red Wedding (with Stannis, Renly, and Robb as allies the Freys and Boltons would have felt less secure committing an atrocity.) 

I imagine in this scenario if Joffrey were killed and Renly or Stannis took the throne, Robb's bannermen and especially the Riverlanders would feel suitably avenged and want to go back to their holdings and plant a new harvest. Robb in spite of his youth and thirst for glory would not want to risk his family and would bend the knee.",asoiaf
818,"It's pretty clear Daenerys has been set up as Aegon I come again, her Dany v Young Griff plot mirrors Rhaenyra v Aegon II (its in the book title), and her possible 'madness' plot line would certainly mirror that of Aerys II. So yeah, past Targaryens and the lore surrounding them is being set up to give hints/foreshadowing to her character. I think there are three that are the most important, and they're her namesakes.

&amp;#x200B;

Also before I start I want to say I dont think everything mentioned will happen to her. I think they're all paths she mat take, or ones hinted at, if that makes sense. And bare with me, this is my first long post. It's pretty tinfoil-y, I know.

&amp;#x200B;

**Daenys the Dreamer:** I'm reaching a little with the name thing for this one, but I believe she's an important part to finding Dany's endgame/character/whatever. For anyone confused, Daenys, liked Dany, had the prophetic dragondreams and 12 years before the Doom of Valyria she went all That's So Raven and realised it was going to happen. She and her family then migrated to Dragonstone and boom 12 years later Valyria is destroyed and House Targaryen are the only dragonriders to survive.

&amp;#x200B;

What I believe is important to do with her is three ~~(heads)~~ things:

1. The dragondreams. Dany has them, and hers are pretty weird if I do say so myself. Here's a quote: ""*Beneath her coverlets she tossed and turned, dreaming that Hizdahr was kissing her … but his lips were blue and bruised, and when he thrust himself inside her, his manhood was cold as ice.""* So yeah, a bit weird. What she does with them however, I think might be linked to a Doom of Valyria type situation, but possibly the opposite, which segues nicely into point
2. Sailing West.  Instead of running away from the goddamn ice zombies, Dany will go west much like Daenys did before her, only this time she's going to maybe save them, maybe *Doom-of-Valyria* the North herself.
3. Marrying a Targaryen is my third. Historically, Daenys married her brother (ew) Gaemon the Glorious. It's kinda stretching but I have a theme going on and if I stretch some tinfoil over this I think it may mean Dany will marry fAegon or Jon (should Jon be a Targaryen, which this post will assume so).

&amp;#x200B;

**Princess Daenerys, daughter of Jaehaerys I:** Princess Daenerys was the second born child of Good Queen Alysanne and Jaehaerys the Conciliator. If you've read Fire and Blood you've probably picked up why she's important. In TWOIAF, Jaehaerys and Alysanne's children did not include a Daenerys, instead including a Prince Aeryn. In Fire and Blood however, the birth order and a couple names have been changed, and Aeryn is replaced by Daenerys.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, three things about her I find interesting and may link back to our Daenerys:

1. Firstly, and most obvious, is that she died of the Shivers. The Shivers seems to be some king of very deadly, very fast-acting cold and it's not difficult to link it to our Dany dying. Now disclaimer it's been a while since I finished ADWD but to my memory in Dany's last couple chapters she's dreadfully sick, and maybe that has something to do with it (I don't think Dany has the Shivers, just that I find it odd George invented a same-name character who died of sickness). So anyway I'm taking this to mean she's at the very least going North, if not dying there.
2. Historical Daenerys was the eldest of Alysanne and Jaehaerys' (at the time) three living children, and while Alysanne believed Daenerys should ascend as Queen due to her age, Jaehaerys believed Daenerys' younger brother Aemon should have been. Hm. Sounds mighty like some other succession issues that may be on the horizon. Firstly, there's fAegon who is (reportedly) born before Dany and also the son of the eldest male heir, and Jon who is (theoretically) the eldest male heir's last surviving son. So yeah, succession crisis yay! Also of note is that Jaehaerys' reply after Alysanne said that Daenerys should be Queen is that 'She would be Queen when she marries Aemon'. So that can be taken a few ways, possibly that our Dany will marry fAegon or Jon and be Queen that way, or that
3. My smaller point but still a point is that Historical Daenerys was crowned the Queen of Love and Beauty. That can be taken a couple ways. That she'll become Queen, that there's comparisons to be made to Lyanna Stark, that there's a connection between Dany and Lyanna (or Lyanna's son), or my favourite- that it's an ironic twist on where Dany will end up. If the show ending is to be believed, Dany will not be the amazing benevolent Queen, or at least people won't believe that she will be. The Historical Daenerys is beloved and crowned Queen of Love and Beauty, and our Dany is crowned as the Foreign Fiery Conquerer.

&amp;#x200B;

**Princess Daenerys, sister of King Daeron II:** Referred to as 'The First Daenerys', (I'll refer to her as this) though this is now incorrect thanks to the retcon of Daenerys (daughter of Jaehaerys) in Fire and Blood. They have some similarities other than name, they both had pretty bad dads (Aegon the Unworthy for First Daenerys, Aerys the Mad for our Daenerys) and they're also kind to/pity smallfolk (First Daenerys lets the children of servants and guards into the Water Gardens, our Daenerys strongly fights for the rights of slaves and other underprivileged members of society. The two actions are a little different I admit but you know what I mean).

&amp;#x200B;

The three things:

1. The first two points are kinda connected. Firstly, that First Daenerys loved a Blackfyre. Specifically Daemon Blackfyre, the one who created House Blackfyre. Barristan believes Daemon rose in rebellion at least partly because his brother King Daeron II had broken up Daemon and First Daenerys (though the timeline is a little messy, theres something like nine or ten years between First Daenerys' marriage and the Blackfyre Rebellion). So what I'm getting at is maybe some kind of fAegon and Dany alliance? I dont buy into it because of the Rhaenyra vs Aegon II parallels but there's something there, I think.
2. Second, is Daenerys being married off. She'd already had that once with Drogo. If we go by the Martell thing, her marrying Quentyn is more or less off the table since Quentyn's BBQ right now, but a Dornish alliance would be interesting, considering how Dorne would be more inclined (and seems to be prepping) to support fAegon since he's (reportedly) half-Martell and also because Quentyn is BBQ thanks to Dany. I also think there's the possibility she marries Jon, or is married off *by* Jon.
3. Uniting the Seven Kingdoms, my most important point for First Daenerys. First Daenerys' marriage to Maron Martell was what brought Dorne into the Realm. Maybe Dany does something similar, in uniting the Realm. Maybe it's another ironic twist, in that one Daenerys brought the realm together and the other broke it apart. Or perhaps even that our Daenerys will unite the Kingdoms...against herself.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway yeah, that's my mish-mash of lore and history that I'm trying to say is foreshadowing, with a weird amount of JonxDany now that I read back on it. Again I'm not presenting this as ""This is all direct foreshadowing and is exactly what will happen/what she'll do"" but rather like a foreshadowing to the choices/paths Dany could take. I hope the names/formatting/writing wasn't too confusing. I also hope it wasn't TOO tinfoil-y.

&amp;#x200B;

Which Targaryens do you think are there to foreshadow Daenerys? Im very curious.",asoiaf
819,"The subject is a quote from Doran Martell.  It is mentioned by Arrianne in her second sample chapter.  Recently I came across the idea of weighing this advice of Doran's against, specifically, the marriage pact with Viserys and and Arrianne.  It was known (by Barristan) even at that young age that Viserys ""seemed to be his father's son in ways that Rhaegar never did.""  How would the purported plan to marry his daughter to this son of the mad king be choosing the winning side?",asoiaf
820,"I've noticed quite a bit of similarities between the structure of these two stories so I thought I'd share:

1. Both stories begin Act III with an attempt to revive a major character who died at the end of Act II. 
        Jack Sparrow in PotC.
        Jon Snow in GoT.

2. Both stories end with a protagonist having to be banished for the greater good.
        In PotC Will has to ferry souls to the next world and can only come on land once every ten years. 
        In GoT Jon Snow is banished to the night's watch and will only be visited occasionally by Sansa or Tyrion.

3. Both stories have the invincible supernatural villain defeated by exploiting his previously established one weakness.
        In PotC Davy Jones is killed by stabbing his heart.
        In GoT the night king is killed by being stabbed with dragon steel (valyrian steel).

4. Both stories have the main human villain be killed in the middle of a giant catastrophe.
        Lord Beckett is killed while his whole ship is being destroyed around him.
        Cersei is killed while her whole city is being destroyed around her.

5. The third act in both stories prominently features the heroes attempt an idiotic plan that backfires on them.
        The pirates attempt to release Calypso by gathering the nine pieces of eight.
        Jon Snow and the rest attempt to capture a wight to convince Cersei to join the Great War.

6. Both stories have the most unexpected person possible become king.
        Elizabeth Swann becomes pirate king.
        Bran becomes king of the six kingdoms.

7. Both stories feature a protagonist with a secret heritage that is somehow important to the story.
        Will Tuner is the son of bootstrap Bill making him the only one who can break the curse (and later on Will's attempts to free his father from Davy Jones becomes important). 
        Jon Snow is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark which the knowledge of which causes him to stop loving Daenerys which causes her to go mad. 

8. Both stories feature a character who betrays the heroes but is later redeemed by rescuing a major female character.
        James Norrington betrays the pirates by giving the heart of Davy Jones to lord Beckett and then redeems himself by rescuing Elizabeth.
         Theron betrays Robb by sacking winterfell but is later redeemed by rescuing Sansa (or Jeyne Pool/fake Arya in the books). 

9. Both stories feature a mysterious witch who can resurrect people.
        Tia Dalma/Kalypso in PotC.
        Melisandre in ASoIaF/GoT.

10. Both stories have almost exclusively ""grey"" characters who do wrong /scummy things but aren't necessarily total villains.

821,"So in one of the chapters when Meera is about to tell Bran a story about a certain **crannogmen** (not sure if this is the right way to write it since my books are in a different language) who I think is Meera and Jojens father.

Emphasis is put on the word ""loves"" and I'm curious if it has any meaning   


Also a side question is when Meera tells her story later on characters like She-Wolf, The Wild Wolf, Quiet Wolf and Young Wolf appear (I translated these from my mind because I read the books in a different language) and I have a feeling it's Lyanna Stark, Brandon, Benjen and Ned?",asoiaf

In season 6 the Yunkai'i arrive with their fleets to begin the bombardment of Mereen. Daeny's dragons however put some of their ships to the torch. So I cannot help wonder why it is that the yunkish fleet wasn't equipped with scorpions to deal with the threat of dragons. Or why they never used scorpions on any other platform. Surely it must have occcured to the ghiscari generals that ships are particularly vulnerable to fire breathing dragons(the kind Daeny has)

I mean, the ghiscari must have heard how flying creatures can be felled with arrows. Dany's dragons are vulnerable to scorpion bolts as they can be killed with relative ease i.e Euron killing Rhaegal with a bolt fired from a scorpion on a ship from behind a promontory.

Logically, shouldn't the ghiscari, of all people of Essos, have had the knowledge needed for the effective development and deployment of anti-dragon scorpions? And, if the secret to felling dragons was always larger and larger scorpions then why did the ghiscari never deploy such scorpions against Daeny's dragons?",asoiaf

824,"When Jon comes out of the tunnel, he steals a glance back at the free folk, then gives a look-see around, then smirks, this seems to suggest he is abandoning the Nights Watch and going to stay with the Free Folk. Then he is shown fading into the forest which implies a cinematic symbolism that he has left forever. Does this mean that he won’t see his family and friends ever again? Also does this mean that he actually can’t come back since he was not actually punished since he escaped his punishment and Yara and the Dornish Prince who are loyal to Dany would likely hear about this if he went about walking over the North and Sansa can’t afford a war with them?

I am reading varying opinions about this everywhere on multiple sub reddits but this is a book-sub so wanted to know what book readers think about this.

On a side note, does anyone fell Arya going sailing came out of nowhere. Throughout the series they built her up as very close to Jon, even adding dialogues like ""I am Arya Stark of Winterfell and I am going home"" only for her to blow off Jon when he asked her to visit him. It seemed jarring and forced to me. Not sure about her mission even succeeding as she lacks the sailing experience.",asoiaf

Personally I'd love to see something about Corlys Velaryon. Such an interesting character. Or maybe a miniseries about the Kingswood Brotherhood? So many rich characters. Maybe something about the Rhoynar coming to Westeros?",asoiaf
826,"I was trying to make sense of the nonsensical Bronn plot on the show (Why does Tyrion give him what he wanted, when the promise was forced at crossbow point, and he's proved not only treacherous as hell, but he's also incompetent as a lord and as a member of the small council - as evidenced in the short scene we've seen in the ending).

In the book there IS a sellsword who Tyrion promises the world to... But it's Brown Ben Plumm, not Bronn. 

He signs a contract granting him and his officers a fortune in gold, in exchange of not returning him to his master. To Ben himself, he promises a castle, lands, a lordship. Pretty much what he offered Bronn on the show (though the castle might not be Highgarden, but who knows).

Now, one might say that the whole ""treacherous"" thing also applies to Ben, and Ben also threatened to kill Tyrion... but there are two main differences.

1) Ben's treachery isn't really a push for power; When he swaps side, it's because there's no point dying in vain against the winning side. This means that if he's sure to be on the winning side, he might not feel the need to do something treacherous. Bronn, on the other hand, seems like he'd do anything to rise in power. He has Highgarden now, but if someone was to offer him the crown, he would kill Bran and Tyrion in a heartbeat. He will never be satisfied with what he has. Even Riverrun wasn't enough. Ben, though he's also a sellsword, could be far more loyal, once he's in the fold as a lord.

2) About the death threats... The main difference is that Bronn's threat was his idea all along. He could've simply fled to Essos if he felt like it, after Cersei's command. But no, he made up a new plan: Steal Highgarden at crossbow point. Ben, on the other hand, was in a bad situation (Tyrion coming in his army, he might have a sickness that could kill the entire company, and also he's an escaped slave, could put them in trouble). He didn't threaten to kill Tyrion to earn something from him... He did it because he didn't want trouble. He wanted to make him disappear, nothing more. 

Tyrion is the one who came up with the plan, he went to talk to Ben willingly, to offer him the gold&amp;lordship and all that. Ben simply agreed. 

So, if Tyrion is ever in a position of power in the books, making Ben a lord would make a lot more sense than making Bronn a lord, after being threatened to death by Bronn, to force him hand into giving him Highgarden. 

Now, the contract with Plumm states ""When Tyrion gets Casterly Rock"". He might just give him a castle sworn to Casterly rock... But on the show they didn't mention a lot of castles, so they just went with Highgarden instead.

One last problem with this, is that Daenerys hates Ben Plumm's gut right now. Could Tyrion convince her to take him back? We'll have to wait and see.

But there's a lot of things that might happen as well... Plumm might come with Tyrion to join Aegon, and eventually swap to the winning side (again).",asoiaf
827,"for Daeny to burn *just* the red keep and those innocent civilians Cersei had gathered in the walls?

She clearly acknowledges that the civilians are hostages to a tyrant. So if we cannot hide behind small mercies then why didn't killing *only* those who were held hostage and their captor suffice? the city had already surrendered and her army was already inside the city. 

And why was she expecting the westerosi to love her?

In season 2 when she tells Jorah that the people aren't waiting for her nor drinking secret toast to their health. That Viserys was a fool to believe those lies. She repeats the same to Varys when she threatens him in season 7. She knew they did not expect to be liberated from the usurper nor were they drink secret toasts to her and that neither were they making preperations for her landing. Even back in season 1 Jorah had warned her that the smallfolk dont care about the highlords and their game of thrones. They only care about rain, healthy babies and a long summer.",asoiaf
828,"Hear me out this is kinda tinfoily but at the very least it's fun to think about, even if I'm wrong

The Targaryens are the only people that we know can bind dragons. But at the same time, only Targs had access to dragons so we dont know if others could. They had to have tamed dragons without the gene at first (unless it was a mutation or something, i doubt well ever get a genetics lesson in the series).Nettles had some targaryen blood I think but she was able to bind Sheep Stealer by calming him down with food and then riding him.

What if other people could do this?

This is only really relevant to two characters: victarion and quentyn if hes alive (I agree with Preston Jacobs, but I might just be in denial).

Quentyn calmed down viserion and viserion was actually responding well to him... until raegal burnt him. This either shows that normal people can bind dragons (let's face it, Frog has so little Valyrian blood that it probably wouldnt matter) or that Quentyn did if hes still alive. His chapter was also called ""The Dragon Tamer"", which could hint to the fact that he actually did take a dragon. The chapter names are very important in feast and dance.

But more importantly theres Victarion. Even if Dragonbinder doesnt work (for example it could actually be used to bind PEOPLE like in that one theory),he has an entire ship full of pork. If he could subdue a dragon he could probably ride it. The pork is Chevoffs gun (idk how its spelt sorry lol), it comes up and seems unimportant but in the 3rd act (or first act or winds) it comes back in a very meaningful way.

TLDR: Targaryens might only be able to bind dragons because they had access to them, not because of special blood. Also no matter what happens Victarions getting a dragon.

I'm probably wrong but hey it's at least something to think about. Also it I got any details wrong feel free to correct me, I made most of this up as I went lol.",asoiaf

LOL, HBO Thinks Game of Thrones Deserves an Emmy for These Season 8 Episodes

The 2019 Emmys ballot is out, and HBO has already penciled in a few Game of Thrones items for awards consideration this year. Instead of focusing on the stronger points of the eighth and final season, however, the cable network is hoping its much-maligned final episodes will earn another trophy for its shelf. Yes, really.

The season's most critically acclaimed episodes of the season, ""Winterfell"" S08E01 and ""A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms"" S08E02, have been completely overlooked in the writing and directing categories in favor of the ones that led fans to petition en masse for a complete rewrite and sparked widespread belief that the show's finale may rank among the worst-ever TV conclusions.

Submitted for Best Directing for the season are Miguel Sapochnik for ""The Long Night"" S08E03, David Nutter for ""The Last of the Starks"" S08E04, and D.B. Weiss and David Benioff themselves for ""The Iron Throne"" S08E06.  And instead of suggesting Dave Hill and/or Bryan Cogman get a look for Best Writing for those well-received initial episodes of the season, Weiss and Benioff's script for ""The Iron Throne"" is the one they're apparently banking on for that category.

As if Game of Thrones' final bow didn't give fans enough to complain about, now they're showing us just how out of touch they are with audience perceptions with this severe oversight. Needless to say, the internet is reacting accordingly today in the wake of this news.

Those suggestions are ... well, they're certainly in keeping with the series' decision to end on a hamfisted note, right? Pass the coffee cup!

In less controversial news, in the Cinematography category, HBO has submitted Fabian Wagner for ""The Long Night"" S08E03, David Franco for ""The Last of the Starks"" S08E04, and Jonathan Freeman for the ""Iron Throne"" S08E06. The penultimate episode, ""The Bells"" S08E05, has meanwhile been put into contention for Art Direction, Visual Effects, and Costuming, and the Hair and Makeup category will take a look at ""The Long Night"" S08E03.

The show will also compete for Best Drama Series as well as the Main Title Design, Casting, Editing, Stunt Coordination, Music, and Sound Mixing categories. (There are also some extraneous Game of Thrones submissions, including Game of Thrones: The Last Watch for Documentary, that GoT-themed Bud Light Super Bowl ad for Commercial, and Game Of Thrones: Fight For The Living for Interactive Media.)

On the performance side, self-submissions include Kit Harington, Emilia Clarke, Alfie Allen, Pilou Asbæk, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Peter Dinklage, Richard Dormer, Gwendoline Christie, Lena Headey, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams, and Carice van Houten.

Game of Thrones has previously cleaned house at the Primetime Emmy Awards, winning for Outstanding Drama Series, Best Supporting Actor (Dinklage), Outstanding Sci-Fi/Fantasy Costumes, Music Composition, Makeup, Stunt Coordination, Production Design, Sound Mixing, and Visual Effects in 2018 alone. But who knows if some of these strange submissions — and the deflated reaction to the show's final run as a whole — will impact their chances of doing as well this year. We'll see.",asoiaf
830,"I once again find myself a little bored.. ;)  

So here is my attempt to try and figure out how fast a dragon grows.  

&gt;The dragons were **no larger than the scrawny cats** she had once seen skulking along the walls of Magister Illyrio's estate in Pentos . . . 

Good thing I have a scrawny cat to measure. :D  

Not including the tail she is somewhere around 14in head to butt.  
Seems like a good Valryian number..  

&gt;until they unfolded their wings. **Their span was three times their length**, each wing a delicate fan of translucent skin, gorgeously colored, stretched taut between long thin bones. 

After doing some measurements of some random bats and birds.  
A 14 inch body might have a wing of about 27in long and 9in wide.  

Add a few inches for a body and a cat sized dragon might have a wingspan of about 60in or 5ft.  

&gt;Ever the largest of her three, in the wild Drogon had grown larger still. **His wings stretched twenty feet from tip to tip**, black as jet.

About 18 months after hatching, Drogon has a wingspan of 20ft.  

So that would be about..  
10in of wingspan a month.   
10ft of wingspan a year.   

If this is a constant rate..  
After 5 years Drogon would have a wingspan of about 55ft.   

I messed around with some pics from this site to try and get a visual.  
www.prehistoric-wildlife.com   

https://i.imgur.com/XCZsRzy.jpg   

&gt;Balerion the Black Dread was two hundred years old when he died during the reign of Jaehaerys the Conciliator. He was so large he could swallow an aurochs whole. **A dragon never stops growing**, Your Grace, so long as he has food and freedom.  

If this same growth never stops, Balerion at 200 years old, would have a wingspan of just over 2000ft across.  

So each wing would be about the size of the Eiffel Tower.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower  

That seems like it has to be wrong or maybe not..   

&gt; Balerion . . . his fire was as black as his scales, his **wings so vast that whole towns were swallowed up in their shadow** when he passed overhead.

Hmm, if we assume a removed 5 year gap, it might be closer to this..  
5in a month.  
5ft a year.  

Drogon at 55ft wingspan after 10 years.  
Balerion at 1000ft wingspan after 199 years.

&gt;""It is only a tale, Khaleesi,"" said her exile knight. ""They talk of wise **old dragons living a thousand years** as well.""

A 10,000ft or 5,000ft wingspan?  :D


&gt;You could have ridden a horse down Vhaghar's gullet, although you would not have ridden it out again. Meraxes was even bigger. And the greatest of them, Balerion, the Black Dread, could have swallowed an aurochs whole, or even one of the hairy mammoths said to roam the cold wastes beyond the Port of Ibben.  

-
&gt;He had passed the bones of a dragon, he swore, so immense that he had ridden his horse through its great black jaws.  

-
&gt;Nagga had been the first sea dragon, the mightiest ever to rise from the waves. She fed on krakens and leviathans and drowned whole islands in her wrath

-
&gt;Of all the queer and fabulous denizens of the Shivering Sea, however, the greatest are the ice dragons. These colossal beasts, many times larger than the dragons of Valyria, are said to be made of living ice, with eyes of pale blue crystal and vast translucent wings through which the moon and stars can be glimpsed as they wheel across the sky.",asoiaf
831,"George R. R. Martin cited real life Wars of the Roses as his inspiration for A Song of Ice and Fire.

- Wars of the Roses were a series of English civil wars between 2 cadet branches of House of Plantagenet: House of Lancaster and House of York for the throne of England.

- The war ended with a Lancaster descendant Henry Tudors becoming the King (Henry VII of England). 

- Henry Tudors's claim to the throne came from his mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort. Margaret is the granddaughter of John Beaufort, the illegitimate son of John of Gaunt (4th son of King Edward III, also the Duke of Lancaster) and his mistress Katherine Swynford. John Beaufort was legitimized after John of Gaunt married Katherine.

- Henry Tudors was the last Lancaster male at the end of the war. He married his 3rd cousin, Elizabeth of York, bring both Lancaster and York branches together.

When people think about Wars of the Roses, people usually draw comparison between Lancaster and Lannister and between York and Stark due to the similarity in their names. However, Lannisters and Starks are not related to each other in ASOIAF while in real life, Lancaster and York are cadet branches of House of Plantagenet. But we have House Targaryen and House Blackfyre, related to each other, fighting for the throne in ASOIAF.

In ASOIAF, House Blackfyre was founded by Daemon I Blackfyre, the bastard of King Aegon IV Targaryen and his cousin, Princess Daena Targaryen. 

- Aegon IV knighted Daemon and gave him Blackfyre, the sword of King Aegon I, the Conqueror. Daemon took the name Blackfyre for himself

- Aegon IV legitimized all of his bastards before he died including Daemon Blackfyre and Aegor Rivers.

- Aegor Rivers backed his brother Daemon Blackfyre's claim to the throne. Aegor also founded Golden Company. The Golden Company fought for House Blackfyre in 4 rebellions.

- Ser Barristan Selmy killed the last Blackfyre male, Maelys I Blackfyre

Now by the 5th book, A Dance with Dragons, a new character, ""young Griff"" claimed to be Aegon Targaryen, son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Elia Martell. Girff said as a child, Varys saved him by doing the baby swap. Young Griff traveled with Jon Connington. 

- Young Griff/Aegon has the support of the Golden Company and Griff has taken over Storm's End. It is very odd that a new player came into the game this late. Not to mention the story of Varys saving young Aegon by switching babies sounds really sketchy. And you have a huge Blackfyre supporter organization like Golden Company to fight for a supposed Targaryen? Didn't the Golden Company just fight 4 wars against Targaryen to put a Blackfyre on the Iron Throne.

- The last Blackfyre male was slain by Ser Barristan Selmy but there might be descendants through the female line. Young Griff might come from the female line of Blackfyre.

- Young Griff says he wants to marry his aunt, Daenery Targaryen, uniting the house.

The real life King Henry VII had his claim to the throne through his mother, a descendant of a legitimized grandson of the King Edward III. Henry VII married his 3rd cousin to unite the Lancaster and York branches. Could this be the story of Young Griff/(f)Aegon? Descendant through the female line of a legitimized bastard. Coming back for the throne and marrying another relative to unite the house. I think this may be the last parallel to Wars of the Roses for George R. R. Martin. The difference is that Daenerys has 3 dragons right now and she would not agree to marry Griff/(f)Aegon since she wants to be the main ruler on the Iron Throne.",asoiaf
832,"Is the betrothal of Elmar Frey to Arya Stark not meant to be taken as an insult?

Elmar frey is something quite close to a hundredth in line for the twins. he isn't even the eldest son of his mother meaning the closest thing he might have to inheritance, her dowry, won't go to him either.

""twenty-second-born son of Walder and the fourth son born of Walder's marriage to Annara Farring""

he is less valuable then the second son of a steward. he is closer to small folk than anything but becoming a household guard let alone the expense of the upkeep of a knight.

Elmar isn't even a great choice based on age, there are several much closer frey's that she could have been betrothed too. like Steffon frey, Stevrons grandson from his third marriage whos unmarried, relatively young and tenth in line to the twins or his sibling Brian Frey who's likely her age or younger based on his being a page. they are also grandsons of stevron whose mother was royce and they have a Waynwood grandmother and Harding mother.  they are higher in succession but unlikely to inherit and would be much better choices based on alliances with vale houses.

as a son of Annara farring Elmar brings with him being the fourth son of a crownland house of no stated land.

now obviously there are older freys with more claim or pull who could be named her betrothed but how could Elmar be chosen as anything other than an insult? Elmar is worse off than Gendry in terms of ability to provide for Arya as he will be kicked out of the twins along with the chaff as soon as walder dies regardless of age. 

Dowry is paid by the bride's house so how could it be argued that the starks should pay dowry to a boy of no worth to anyone to support the second daughter of a lord paramount and ruler of Winterfell/moat Cailin.\

Genna Lannister's marriage to Emmon who is only the second son of Walder frey and by his marriage at 14 likely still 2nd or maybe third in inheritance was considered the scandal of the season and a major point of derision for Tytos Lannister.


so this offer of betrothal must have been meant as an insult. we are given multiple examples of why it should be but its barely mentioned. so Why would Arya not deserve better in this negotiation? Desperation aside this offer was clearly meant to be an insult owing that Sansa was considered catch enough for Joffrey before any of her brothers were dead.",asoiaf
833,"I read the books while I waited for the final season, and the entire time I read once Belwas was introduced, I wondered if it was Varys in disguise. Throughout the books they emphasize how complete and foolproof Varys’ disguises are, including (although maybe they only alluded to it, I forget if it was explicitly confirmed) how he was the black cell jailer that helped Tyrion escape, before he the jailor disappeared entirely (leaving only an old highgarden club behind, perhaps to increase tension between the Tyrells and Lannisters so they would fight each other?).


I believe the whole time we see Belwas with Dany, we never hear from Varys. My thoughts are that Varys is a faceless man, so showing physical prowess is no issue for him since he’s been trained as a deadly assassin. I haven’t seen theories in this before, so idk if I’m just sounding like an idiot",asoiaf
834,"This was a comment I did in another thread, would like to see it discussed because the pieces fit.

Please excuse the lack of polish, I ain't got time for that today.

So, let's not interpret the Golden Empire of the Dawn origins as literal, but myths that go back thousands of years.

If Maiden is Light is the Sun, and Lion of the Night is the literal Night (not moon, Night, and the dangers that lurk in it), we have an interesting thing going on.

They have a human ""God on Earth"" who claims to be the son of the Sun and the Night (pretty classic hey I am king now origin story). He doesn't live 10,000 years, but his Dynasty maybe does (or way less).

The other emperors like Pearl aren't physical people, but Dynasties. The matches very well with actual Chinese history, and since these are ""gods"", I'd imagine the people don't see them much (if they are out, they are in palanquins, as it was said the God on Earth travelled, carried by his 100 wives). So the son takes over for example, but is treated as the same person (e.g Pearl Emperor being an inherited title, and the plebeians know no better)

This goes on until the Amethyst Empress is about to get the throne. We have a parallel with the Dance of Dragons suddenly, where the Bloodstone Emperor usurps the throne from the rightful heir (maybe because she was a woman?)

What if about then, the first meteor comes down. He begins to worship it, creating the Church of the Starry Sky.

Now, let's just say that is the first one to fall. Suddenly, meteors begin landing all over the world (Dorne anyone?). I am assuming that this period of time last for years, I will go in more detail below. What is important is this next part:

A MASSIVE meteor crashes around where the Grey Wastes are, decimating all life, deserting the surrounding regions, and covering the Wastes with deep layers of ash (that's why the Grey Wastes are grey not sand colored, it's ash not sand)

This Meteor, let's call it the Grey One, is large enough to cover the world in ash and dust, blocking the light from the Sun (maiden of light turning her back) and the Lion of the Night wreaks havoc on the world (""demons"" or desperate people pillaging and killing each other to survive) during the Long Night aka period where the world was covered in ash, no sun or proper heating therefore winter everywhere, demons of the Night could be the Others or whatever analogue Essos might have.

This would have been a good opportunity for the Others to invade Westeros as well, claim it for their own. Maybe they didn't blacken the skies of the entire world, but once the sun wasn't there to stop them, they expanded with their ice powers.

Check these out:

Cannibal Sands: people are known to consume flesh, actual desert. Maybe they got that moniker from having to eat their dead to avoid mass starvation after the meteor destroys their land.

https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cannibal_Sands

Dry Deep: No water or life, near the impact zone, everything died.

https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dry_Deep

Bonetown: Made out of bones, they sell bones, everything is centered around bones, something that might have been in large supply after a whole region was wiped out from a cataclysmic meteor fall.

https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bonetown

To get even more tinfoily:

I will say, if the oily black stone is meteor material, things get interesting. Let's assume that they fall throughout Planetos for a period of years, enough for the Church of the Starry Sky to get huge, and the Bloodstone Emperor (and his descendants) to utilize the black rock

Yeen is made from huge blocks of black stone, perhaps remnants from smaller meteors? This could mean Yeen was founded by the Bloodstone Emperor. The rocks in Yeen aren't fused, because they were far enough from any massive strikes.

Asshai is also made from this, and is UBER MASSIVE so it probably doesn't make sense, but we don't know if it is fused stone or large bricks like Yeen.

The five forts are also made from this material, doesn't sound possible to build at all. BUT, it is fused, like dragonstone.

What if it got FUSED from being close to the meteor impact? The geography fits, they were massive structures so they survived, but the heat was so intense any cracks got fused together.

This could mean that: the Bloodstone Emperor ruled for a while, worshipping the first black stone that fell, building his ""holy cities"" with meteor materials (Yeen, Asshai). Eventually, the Grey One hits, global catastrophe mode engaged, meteors are now seen as the devil, and thus the Bloodstone Emperor worshipping them is what caused all of this (in the minds of the people).

**TL,DR:** GEOTWD myths are not literal, but legends based off of a cataclysmic event that destroyed an entire region and ushered the Long Night due to the debris from a massive meteor impact.

The Bloodstone Emperor might have been behind the building of Asshai and Yeen, since he cherished the black stone, and once a meteor destroys all hope of life, it is suddenly seen as evil incarnate.

837,"Putting the TV-show aside - which created the Valyrian language - let's try to figure out what GRRM might've had in mind with the Prince that was Promised prophecy. Specifically, in how it relates to gender. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the reason I bring this up is because a lot of fans seem to believe that words for ""prince"" and ""dragon"" in High Valyrian are gender neutral - from which they conclude that many other words in the language maybe gender-neutral as well. Which then has implication on other prophecies like ""valonqar"". While the latter is definitely a stretch (just because a language has gender neutral words doesn't mean its entirely gender neutral), even the first part looks unsubstantiated to me. Why would you assume that the High-Valyrian prophecy was stated in gender neutral terms to begin with?

&amp;#x200B;

The best answer, ofcourse, would be based on Maester Aemon's words:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No one ever looked for a girl ... It was a prince that was promised, not a princess....What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! The error crept in from the translation. Dragons are neither male nor female, Barth saw the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame. The language misled us all for a thousand years.

&amp;#x200B;

But from what I can see, Aemon never says that the words for ""prince"" or ""dragon"" in High Valyrian are gender neutral. That's simply the conclusion we've chosen to draw. And I want to look at an alternative explanation here:

&amp;#x200B;

**Age of the Prophecy:** Assuming Aemon is being literal, the prophecy seems to predate Aegon's Conqeust and the Doom of Valyria. Which means, it likely originated in Valyria. 

&amp;#x200B;

In which case, I find it rather suspicious that it'd refer to a ""prince"" in the first place. The Valyrian Empire was an Oligarchy - they didn't have princes or kings. When writing down a prophecy that refers to a savior or a leader of some sort - someone who rises from their community - they are unlikely to refer to him as a prince. The interpretation of prophecy is usually contextual and the context of the original prophecy was Old Valyria. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Nature of Foresight:** This we know from the series proper - visions of future are often vague and metaphorical. Whether its dreams or fire-watching or acid trips, character don't see the future literally - they see stuff like ""a blue-eyed king who cast no shadow"" or ""a boy with the face of a wolf"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Based on these 2 things I'd argue that the PtwP prophecy is the same - that some ""prophet"" in ancient Valyria had a vision full of metaphors and wrote down what he understood within the context of his culture. 

&amp;#x200B;

And from that I posit that the original prophecy was about ""the Dragon that was promised"". The original prophet saw something like a vision of a 3-headed dragon bursting forth from his stone and he figured that it foretold the coming of a savior who'd happen to be a dragon-rider. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Error:** Now the original prophecy was in High Valyrian, but at some point - probably after Aegon's conquest - it was translated in Common Tongue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its entirely possible that High Valyrian has different words for male and female dragons - assuming that they don't know that dragons are actually interchangeably male or female. On the other hand, if they do know this detail about dragon biology, then it'd make no sense for them to have different words for dragons based on gender - just like we don't have different terms for male and female earthworms. However, if that is true, one wonders why the Targaryens managed to lose that bit of significant information and it had to be rediscovered by Septon Barth. 

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, this is where the error crept in. Either the original prophet assumed that the dragon in his vision was a male (conveniently forgetting about their gender neutrality) and used the word for a male dragon or the word for dragon in High Valyrian is gender neutral but that detail was forgotten during translation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now obviously the prophecy doesn't refer to a literal dragon - its being interpreted in a Westerosi context now and Westeros has a monarchy. Just like the Stallion who Mounts the World is assumed to refer to a khalakka, this dragon savior was assumed to refer to a ""prince"". And this is the error that Aemon was talking about. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, that's my theory anyway. Its not necessarily that the original prophecy was gender neutral - its that the nature of visions and the subsequent translation based on context caused the interpretation to be gender-confusing.

&gt;My brothers feared I might die before they got me back to Maester Mullin at the Shadow Tower, so they carried me to a wildling village where we knew an old wisewoman did some healing. She was dead, as it happened, but her daughter saw to me. Cleaned my wounds, sewed me up, and fed me porridge and potions until I was strong enough to ride again. And she sewed up the rents in my cloak as well, with some scarlet silk from **Asshai** that her grandmother had pulled from the wreck of a cog **washed up on the Frozen Shore**. It was the greatest treasure she had, and her gift to me.""

This is Mance talking about the scarlet silk mixed with the black of his original Night's Watch Cloak.

What if the doom of Valyria was a nuclear explosion?

I think this for a few reasons. Firstly, I always found it odd that “fire cannot kill a dragon,” and yet the dragons were supposed to have fallen out of the sky because of the heat. Now if that was an exposed reactor that’d make more sense. The radiation wiping dragons in the air.

Secondly, the glass candles and Valyrian steel are advanced technology, why not suppose the Valyrians also had nuclear fission or something comparable. Look at the stone black walls that were built. Nuclear power could be the “dragon fire” the Valyrians harnessed.

Another thing I noticed is Euron’s dragon horn. It’s said he gets slaves to blow it because it kills the user.  The user gets horrible blisters and burns. I think this is like a highly radioactive substance like the graphite in Chernobyl. Slaves touch it and slowly die from radiation poisoning.

Finally, in the towns surrounding Valyria children born are deformed. This is mentioned in the World of Ice &amp; Fire book. Wouldn’t it make sense that the families are living in a fallout zone with radiation poisoning harming their foetuses?

842,"With the show being over, what in retrospect are your top 10 favorite episodes? Here are mine:

1: S3E5 - *Kissed by Fire*

Easily my favorite episode of the show, from my favorite season. Contains the best trial by combat scene; The Hound &amp; Beric, the best romance scene; Jon &amp; Ygritte in the cave, the best of Jamie; bath scene, a really heartfelt moment between Shireen &amp; the imprisoned Davos, and finally the execution of Karstark by Robb. The episode draws so many parallells to its title as well.

2: S6E10 - *Winds of Winter*

Speaks for itself really. As a book reader, you can still appreciate the amazing cinematography that is the first 25 minutes of this episode. The rest of the episode is filled with satisfying scenes, and ends with Dany FINALLY sailing to Westeros. The perfect ending for the show.

3: S4E9 - T*he Watchers on the Wall*

Miles better than Battle of the Bastards and Battle for Winterfell. Most underrated episode in the show.

4: S4E7 - *Mockingbird*

Near perfect episode. Contains the best dialogue in the whole show between Tyrion and Oberyn, and continues the momentum of the second half of season *4.*

5: S4E6 - *The Laws of Gods and Men*

The start of the adrenaline rush that is the later half of season 4. Peak Tyrion, the final minutes depicts what could've been if the show included the Tysha reveal for Tyrion's character in latter seasons.

6: S2E9 - *Blackwater*

The climax of the darkest season. Peak show-Cersei, peak show-Stannis, peak HotK Tyrion, introduction to a KL with Tywin &amp; Tyrells.

7: S3E7 - *The Rains of Castamere*

Slightly overrated but no one can deny the impact it had on the show's popularity, the culture of show reactions and the tv-landscape as a whole. One of the only great episodes of the show I have a hard time rewatching, and for good reasons.

8: S4E8 - *The Mountain and the Viper*

The Red Wedding of Season 4.

*9: S3E7 - The Bear and the Maiden Fair*

     So when she turns the tables during the exchange and starts killing everyone with her dragons and army, we get the impression that she never intended to sell Drogon.

     So why the build up of Dany and the fake grief? As a reader we are in her head so we should of known what she planned to do before it happened. Instead I feel like Grrm just wanted to surprise us. Kind of ruined an an otherwise epic moment. (1st reread btw.)

Edit: some more points: it seems like her crew is in on the double cross as well. She brings her ENTIRE force including her other dragons. Her warriors come equipped. We get some hint the night before that they are even preparing for it: 2 dothraki renewing a bowstring and sharpening his weapon.

848,"So, I have been thinking a lot about how much the book ending and the show ending line up, and I'm personally of the opinion that although a lot of the ""beats"" of the story were hit by the show, the chronology is all wrong and the contexts are vastly different.

I've been doing a re-read to try and find textual justifications for what we saw on the show, but then I realised that there is somewhere else we could be looking for hints as to what is important and what isn't: the 1993 plot outline, which you can see [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6nq2ti/main_spoilers_original_3page_outline_by_george_rr/)

Now, a lot has changed since 1993 (the year I was born!) but it seems that there are kernels of the real story in that outline, and I want to go through a couple of points which may suggest what the book ending could possibly be, especially in light of the show ending. In using evidence from the show, I would like to argue that perhaps GRRM has not moved as far away from his original intention as laid out in the 1993 outline as we once thought. Now, lets get started!

**The Original Trilogy**

In the outline, GRRM stated he was planning three books: A Game of Thrones, A Dance with Dragons, and The Winds of Winter. We know that guesstimation was totally wrong, but what he says in the outline does hint at what he saw the overall narrative structure as being in 1993:

* A Game of Thrones - Enmity between Stark and Lannister is developed, the Iron Throne is the ultimate prize.
* A Dance with Dragons - While Stark and Lannister fight each other, a bigger threat emerges from over the Narrow Sea: Daenerys and her Dothraki invade Westeros.
* The Winds of Winter - The threat of the Others will finally be revealed, and the fight between the Humans and the Others will dominate the final book.

So, it seems in 1993, GRRM's plot trajectory was War of the Five Kings =&gt; Daenerys' invasion =&gt; Long Night.

In his description of the Winds of Winter, he goes on to say that ""the final battle will also draw together characters and plot threads left from the first two books and resolve all in one huge climax"".

This is not what the show gave us. The show gave us *two* climaxes - the Battle at Winterfell against the Others and then Daenerys going ""mad"" and kabooming King's Landing. The show's trajectory was War of Five Kings =&gt; Splinter Conflicts =&gt; Stark's retake Winterfell =&gt; Daenerys' attempted invasion =&gt; Long Night =&gt; Daenerys' complete invasion. This seems very at odds with GRRM's 1993 plan, as it fractured Daenerys' invasion and placed it either side of the Long Night.

Now, of course a lot has changed since 1993. A lot of books have been added, with ""Dance with Dragons"" and ""Winds of Winter"" being the fifth and sixth books of the series respectively. The addition of the seventh book, ""A Dream of Spring"", may indicate that GRRM intends to do something *after* the Long Night. Many fans have highlighted his love for LotR's ""Scouring of the Shire"" and have argued that Daenerys' going mad and burning KL could constitute such a ""Scouring"".

However, this does not take into account that the contents of the trilogy of books are no longer in line with the outline. Daenerys' invasion of Westeros does not take place in A Dance with Dragons - she is still pissing about in Essos. Instead, the title now seems an allusion to the original ""Dance of the Dragons"" between Aegon II and his sister Rhaenyra over the Iron Throne. DwD is of course the book where fAegon is introduced, so the ""dance"" now seems to not correspond to Daenerys' invasion, but to the emergence of a new Targaryen/Blackfyre threat. Why then do we think that the Winds of Winter will contain the battle with the Others? The ""Dance"" between Daenerys and fAegon is by no means concluded, and given GRRM's original intention to ""resolve all in one huge climax"", it would seem strange for this storyline to finish after the Long Night. I therefore wonder if the events that roughly correspond to Episodes 1-3 will happen almost simultaneously with those of Episodes 4-6, or even if fAegon's demise happens before the Long Night.

What evidence do I have for this?

**The Important Characters**

In the outline, GRRM lists five main characters who will survive to the third volume: Daenerys, Jon, Arya, Bran, and Tyrion. Let's look at each character in turn to see how far their show endings line up with the 1993 outline.

*Bran and Jon*

Now, in the [deciphered redacted section](https://imgur.com/lFswGVp) of the outline, it seems that GRRM intended that perhaps Bran would sit ""free"" on the Iron throne following a premature death (whose? I'll come back to that in a moment). However, his seat ""is not a comfortable one"" as Jon has become his bitter enemy in the North, as well as Daenerys across the Narrow Sea, and the Others North of the Wall.

This seems to suggest that originally, Bran's coronation was not intended to be a kind of elective monarchy/way to solve all problems after both Jon and Daenerys had made themselves illegible for the throne (Daenerys by going mad, Jon by killing her) after the Long Night. Instead, it seems Bran would become king through magic, but would be opposed by Jon and Daenerys, a continuation of the Game of Thrones, if you will. Many fans have been concerned that Bran's election felt a bit too ""Aragorn is a good king because he is good"", and were a bit disappointed with this being the final outcome. However, if we accept the redacted bits of the outline, it seems the show's ""King Bran"" will not be what we get, as the opposition to King Bran would be more extensive in the books. Although Jon and Bran probably won't become enemies in the books, it is clear that other characters may oppose Bran's ascension, and it won't be all plain sailing, which will feel a lot more in keeping with the overall tone of the books.

Furthermore, it seems that GRRM intended the election of King Bran to happen in Book 2, meaning *before the Long Night.* This does not seem to indicate Bran was intended as the magical healer king come to rebuild the world after the Long Night, but that Jon, Daenerys, and Bran may have to put aside their differences and come too work together during the Long Night. Three heads of the dragon, anyone?

As for Jon, it seems GRRM intended Jon's parentage to come out during Book Three, *after* Daenerys' invasion and *during* the Long Night. This would seem to suggest that Jon's parentage is not important for ""heir to the Iron Throne"" reasons, but for Azor Ahai/A Song of Ice and Fire reasons. This change heavily impacts Daenerys' downfall as we see it on the show, as there would be no reason for supporters like Varys (or book equivalents) to campaign for King Jon, seeing as no one would know Jon's parentage prior to Daenerys' burning of KL. Furthermore, it would suggest that Jon is Azor Ahai, and maybe that he needs a Nissa Nissa.

*Daenerys, Arya, and Tyrion*

Now, as Daenerys is touted as surviving to the third novel, it is clear that she was meant to survive her invasion in ""Dance with Dragons"" and be present for the Long Night in ""Winds of Winter"". If we accept that GRRM still intends to tie together all loose plot ends from the earlier books and resolve in one huge climax, it seems unlikely that Daenerys will later decide to blow things up and Bran will become king by default. Instead, it seems GRRM's original intention was for Daenerys to invade Westeros when Bran was king (as per the redacted section), and then become involved, somehow, in the Long Night. As neither Daenerys' invasion or Bran's ascension has happened yet, I feel it is entirely possible that Bran's ascension will come much earlier than we all suspect, and actually, Daenerys' blowing up of King's Landing will also precede the Long Night, and be part of her invasion. Alternatively, the king who Daenerys attacks prior to the Long Night may be fAegon, and her burning of KL with fAegon on the Iron Throne will make much more sense given what he represents to her legitimacy. I therefore think the ""Mad Queen Daenerys"" plot line will come before the Long Night, and will be followed by her joining Jon in fighting the Others.

The main character we seem to get the least about in the outline is Arya, but what does seem clear is her relationship to Needle was always important, as was her relationship with Jon. Now, in the outline it is clear that Arya was originally meant to fall in love with Jon and be tortured by the fact that he was her brother, until the truth was revealed about his parentage in the last book. Meanwhile, Tyrion was meant to switch sides from the Lannisters after being betrayed by his family (more on that in the moment) and come and join the Starks, where he ended up in a Jon/Arya/Tyrion love triangle, suffering from an ""unreciprocated passion"".

In the books, we know that Tyrion *is* betrayed by his family, but instead of joining the Starks, we know that he intends to join Daenerys, and it seems (given the show) that is very obviously what he will do. We also know given the show (and Daenerys' House of the Undying Vision) that a Daenerys/Jon relationship seems very likely and that there was some subtext in Seasons 7 and 8 of Tyrion being in love with Daenerys. So, what happens if we switch ""Arya"" for ""Daenerys""? We suddenly have a Jon/Daenerys/Tyrion love triangle that looks very plausible given the hints in the show, and in the outline. A deadly rivalry could emerge between Jon and Tyrion if they both fall in love with Daenerys, especially if Tyrion is the one who eggs Daenerys on to attack King's Landing (without telling her about the wildfire, which will make things 100% worse) and is the one to lead her down a dark path.

For this love triangle to be fully fleshed out, Jon would have to a) have time to fall in love with Daenerys and b) know of Tyrion's involvement in the destruction of King's Landing. Given GRRM's original intention to do Daenerys' invasion =&gt; Long Night, it seems both Daenerys and Tyrion would have to be involved in the destruction of fAegon during Daenerys' invasion, and then join Jon in the Long Night. Jon's murder of Daenerys would therefore have to take place *during the Long Night,* and would therefore have to be much more in line with a Azor Ahai/Nissa Nissa prophecy style ending than a valonqar type murder we saw in the show (I would argue, as the show did neither prophecy, they had to improvise and gave Cersei and Jaime's intended ending to Jon and Daenerys).

Of course, there are some things that don't quite sit comfortably with the books here. How does Tysha and the whole ""where do whores go?"" arc fit here? How exactly does Azor Ahai/Nissa Nissa go down - is it a blood sacrifice? Does Jon literally have to stab Daenerys? Or is it more metaphorical? If Arya is not playing the love interest, what is so important about her to justify her as one of the main characters?

**The Less Important Characters**

The outline mentions several other characters that are not amongst the ""main five"": Ned, Catelyn, Joffrey, Sansa, Jaime, Mance, and Benjen. As the first three listed are no longer with us, I only want to deal with the last four.

*Benjen and Mance*

I'm going to start with Benjen, as I probably have the least to say on this one. Benjen is only mentioned in line with Catelyn, Bran, and Arya coming to the Wall, where they are told that Jon and Benjen cannot help them. This eventually spurs them on to go North. It seems that GRRM did not originally intend Benjen to go missing in action, so it seems Benjen's fate is one that has changed dramatically since the 1993 outline. Mance, on the Other hand, seems to serve the same purpose - to demonstrate to the reader the power of the Others. His wildling camp is attacked by the Others, and although it goes down differently in the books, it seems that was always the main purpose of Mance and the wildlings.

*Sansa*

Now, in the outline, Sansa was intended to marry Joffrey and bear his son. This, of course, did not happen in the books. However, I think the killing of Lady was meant to be foreshadowing of Sansa's decision to chose her Lannister husband over her Stark family, it is just that this foreshadowing never led to anything. In the outline, it is mentioned that Jaime succeeds in taking the throne after Joffrey by killing all claimants in line before him. Would this have included Sansa and her child? I think Sansa's ending is one that has changed dramatically since the outline days.

*Jaime (and Cersei)*

Now, outline Jaime is a bit of a shit. It seems GRRM's original intention was to have Jaime murder his way to the throne after Joffrey's demise, blaming his brother Tyrion in the process. In his anger, Tyrion would have then have gone and joined the Starks. This has led some people to argue that Jaime's direction (like Sansa's) has dramatically changed since 1993, especially given all the heavy handed hints in Book 1 that Jaime ""looked like a king"", which were swiftly dropped.

However, I would argue that is not the case. What happens when you switch the word ""Jaime"" for ""Cersei""? Suddenly, Outline Jaime's story appears to be Cersei's from A Storm of Swords onwards, and neatly mirrors her taking of the throne after her murder of the Tyrells/Tommen's death on the show, with Tyrion not joining the Starks (his family's enemies), but Daenerys. Cersei does not appear in the outline at all, and it seems that is because Outline!Jaime became Book!Cersei.

So, it seems, from the outline, the original succession was meant to be Robert (who has an unfortunate accident), Joffrey (who is maimed in battle and then ""removed"" by Tyrion) and then Jaime (who will blame Tyrion for unnamed murders, possibly of Joffrey and Sansa's child) in Book 1. Then at some point after this, there would be a ""premature death"" and Bran will sit the Iron Throne, before Daenerys invades.

Of course, the rough chronology of who sits the Iron Throne has changed since then, but its seems the key beats are still the same. **Robert** =&gt; **Joffrey** =&gt; **Jaime** =&gt; **Bran** has become **Robert** =&gt; **Joffrey** =&gt; Tommen =&gt; Myrcella (?) =&gt; **Cersei (?)** =&gt; fAegon (?) =&gt; **Bran (?)**.

**Conclusions**

I have tried to demonstrate that evidence from the show seems more in line with the 1993 outline than what we thought, and the 1993 outline may not be as whacky as what the fandom has long thought it is. In combination of the books, the show, and the outline, I think we can see an ending that looks something like this:

* Cersei murders her way to the throne.
* Tyrion joins Daenerys, and falls in love with her.
* Cersei's reign is ""prematurely"" ended, possibly by Jaime preventing her from setting off wildfire.
* fAegon and Arianne will invade King's Landing, with Arianne being the ""younger and more beautiful one"".
* Daenerys will invade, and will be opposed on many fronts, maybe by Jon, Bran, and fAegon.
* Tyrion will egg Daenerys on into burning King's Landing, and action that will be worse than anticipated given that he will not tell her about the wildfire.
* A penitent Daenerys (and maybe Tyrion) will go North. They will fight alongside Jon and Bran in the Long Night.
* Bran will be made king during the Long Night, and will be opposed.
* Jon will kill Daenerys during the Long Night in a kind of Azor Ahai/Nissa Nissa sacrifice, or parallel, or evocation.
* There is room for someone else to take the throne/the throne be destroyed in ADOS.

There are, of course, several loose cannons that the outline does not deal with that will be pressing in the books, namely Stannis and Euron. 26 years and numerous added characters could mean that the entire plot has completely changed, but I think there is enough in common between the show and the outline to suggest that GRRM has not veered away from the outline as much as we once thought.

849,"I just watched the Last Watch documentary and at the 15 mins mark the executive producer says that ""Like Jon Snow, we are not going to be seeing a lot of our family"". So does this canonically confirm that Jon left with the Free Folk forever never to return and abandoned the Nights Watch? Because if he was at Castle Black or he was a ranger he could obviously go down to Winterfell and KL. Or am I overthinking it? Did he become a wildling as per this sentence? So we can stop thinking that the uniform means he is with the NW or a ranger.",asoiaf
850,"Sorry if this post is rambly. Through out the books, we are told Dany is  speaking in Valyrian though it is obviously translated to the common tongue for us. 

The most common instance of when we here valyrian directly translated into the common tongue is ""Valar Morghulis""/ ""Valar Dohaeris"" meaning ""all men must die"" and ""all men must serve"" respectivley. Do we ever find out if ""all men"" means all people in valyrian or is there a female equivalent ""valara"" or something? In addition, at some point during ADWD Dany misinterprets what one of the sons of the harpy says in high valyrian and Missandei points out there is only a word for king in high valyrian not queen.

851,"Now there is some argument to be had that the TV show &amp; books are different universes. However, in absence of evidence to the contrary when it comes to specific lore points. I assume for the sake of argument that the books are the lore, lacking a contradiction in the show. For this reason I think the whole idea of Drogon picking Dany and flying her to Valyria is a dumb idea on multiple counts.

The first and most important is that Drogon has never been to Valyria, likely has no idea where it is, and no reason to travel there. It would be not so different from Scottish Terrier born and raised in America deciding at random upon the death of their owner that he was going to brave the trip to Scottland, just cause. I get Dragons are supposed to be near human intelligence but the point still stands. 

Second, Old Valyria is supposed to be a death trap in the modern world. In Fire and Blood Part 1, Balerion towards the end of his life traveled to Valyria (which makes sense because he grew up there) and basically got bushwhacked. Returning to Westeros later in life with incredibly severe injuries and one of the Targaryen Princesses infected with parasitic flesh worms that were almost certainly supernatural creatures of fire. This is by the way when Balerion was at his largest, the size of a small town (far larger than the much younger Drogon). The fact that he sustained such injuries in his travels to the ruins of that civilization mean it is more than likely that Valyria faced some Balrog level event during the doom. As quite simply nothing else in the books (and only debatable the Night King in the show), would be able to hurt such an old and powerful dragon. Meaning that if Drogon went to that ancient cursed land, it would be nothing short of suicidal.

Which kind of brings me to the point that it was a silly and fan pleasing idea that the show runners didn't really put a whole lot of time into. At least they made it vague enough in the show that I could pretend that isn't what happened. Though the clear implication that Drogon was traveling there is irritating all the same.",asoiaf
852,"Since Game of Thrones ended, there's been a lot of discussion on the merits of an animated adaptation in the future. While I believe the story itself lends very strongly to the animation medium, I have yet to see discussion of this fact that, if ASOIAF is every going to be adapted to screen again, will make animation necessary.

In the future, it is going to be difficult to film in the snow. Already by ADWD, the north sees foots worth of snow. In Kings Landing, Kevan trudges through inches to get to the Tower of the Hand. Meanwhile, in the real world, glaciers are melting, snowpack everywhere is decreasing, and it rains during the winter in Scandinavia. In 10, 15, 20 years time, where could a crew film the lands Beyond the Wall? 

It seems to me that for as expensive animation is, it will in all likelihood be less expensive than waiting for a snowy enough string of days to film as to fully faithfully adapt ASOIAF in the future.",asoiaf
853," 

No, i am not talking about Mance's fire, i am talking about Sansa's candle in Season 5.

So in one of the first episodes of Season 5, Sansa vows to teach Boltons a lesson and that's why willingly goes to marry Ramsay but let's assume that is some kind of a masterplan which is very logical for this post.

Then LF tells her the rest of his master plan, that he is waiting for Stannis to attack Winterfell and win and so Sansa goes in 'safe hands' which Sansa forgets just a few episodes later when she marries Ramsay and what is her sole weapon in this? a Candle. So Sansa just strolls around in Winterfell for the first few episodes doing nothing and enjoying instead of making allies, talking to people, and when Ramsay marries her, when she sees his true nature, she decides to fuck the plan of waiting for Stannis (who btw was very near) and sticks to her backup plan of lighting a candle about which she had no idea who sent or what.

Now let's look at this Candle, Brienne orders this, and Sansa should light the candle if she is in danger, and then what? What the hell can Brienne even do against entire Winterfell? wear her plot armour and kill everyone? do something which Stannis and his entire army couldnt do?

And if she was going to do something like what Mance/Abel was going to do, it was going to need a lot of planning and firstly why does she even want Sansa to tell her that she is in danger? i bet everyone around Ramsay and Winterfell knows that how cruel he his, nor does he flay in private, he had corpses out in the open, did Brienne think that Sansa was actually happy with such a husband?

And now comes the most ridiculous part, Sansa risks everything, that too when Stannis was about to attack (remember the original plan again) to light a very small candle in daylight and on top of that we see next that from where Brienne was living, the candle could be seen very clearly like it was a big fire or something and obviously Brienne chooses that exact second not to see it and instead goes through the the Bolton army and kills Stannis.

Knowing Dany’s endgame, certain parts of the text reveal new insights. I have always argued that Dany might prove victor in the battlefield but she will definitely lose the PR war in Westeros. First of all, remember how this kind of game is supposed to be played as we learned from the master:

&gt; “A tale of somewhat the same nature, perhaps. But more easily believed. Lord Stannis has spent most of his marriage apart from his wife. Not that I fault him, I’d do the same were I married to Lady Selyse. Nonetheless, if we put it about that her daughter is baseborn and Stannis a cuckold, well . . . the smallfolk are always eager to believe the worst of their lords, particularly those as stern, sour, and prickly proud as Stannis Baratheon.”

&gt; “He has never been much loved, that’s true.” Cersei considered a moment. “So we pay him back in his own coin. Yes, I like this. Who can we name as Lady Selyse’s lover? She has two brothers, I believe. And one of her uncles has been with her on Dragonstone all this time . . .”

&gt; “Ser Axell might serve for Shireen’s father, but in my experience, the more bizarre and shocking a tale the more apt it is to be repeated. Stannis keeps an especially grotesque fool, a lackwit with a tattooed face.”

&gt; Grand Maester Pycelle gaped at him, aghast. “Surely you do not mean to suggest that Lady Selyse would bring a _fool_ into her bed?”

&gt; “You’d have to be a fool to want to bed Selyse Florent,” said Littlefinger. “Doubtless Patchface reminded her of Stannis. And the best lies contain within them nuggets of truth, enough to give a listener pause. As it happens, this fool is utterly devoted to the girl and follows her everywhere. They even look somewhat alike. Shireen has a mottled, half-frozen face as well.”

&gt; Pycelle was lost. “But that is from the greyscale that near killed her as a babe, poor thing.”

&gt; “I like my tale better,” said Littlefinger, “and so will the smallfolk. Most of them believe that if a woman eats rabbit while pregnant, her child will be born with long floppy ears.”

When Stannis sent letters about the twincest, Littlefinger countered that by spreading vile calumnies about Selyse and Patchface giving Stannis horns. There is already a similarly wicked campaign against Dany in Essos:

&gt; “If even half the stories coming back from Slaver’s Bay are true, this child is a monster. They say that she is bloodthirsty, that those who speak against her are impaled on spikes to die lingering deaths. They say she is a sorceress who feeds her dragons on the flesh of newborn babes, an oathbreaker who mocks the gods, breaks truces, threatens envoys, and turns on those who have served her loyally. They say her lust cannot be sated, that she mates with men, women, eunuchs, even dogs and children, and woe betide the lover who fails to satisfy her. She gives her body to men to take their souls in thrall.”

&gt; “They say,” said Haldon. “By _they_, you mean the slavers, the exiles she drove from Astapor and Meereen. Mere calumnies.”

&gt; “The best calumnies are spiced with truth,” suggested Qavo,

In my experience, these calumnies are generally discarded by the fandom because we are in pro-Dany POVs and we know better. But for a person in the story who does not know Dany nor reads her POVs, above calumnies are not hard to believe. It is a good exercise to see what elements from Dany’s story are twisted to produce this black propaganda against her:

&gt; They say that she is bloodthirsty, that those who speak against her are impaled on spikes to die lingering deaths. 

Crucifixion of the 163 Great Masters.

&gt; They say she is a sorceress who feeds her dragons on the flesh of newborn babes. 

The funeral pyre where the dragons were born, the episode with the Undying of Qarth and the death of Hazzea. 

&gt; an oathbreaker who mocks the gods, breaks truces, threatens envoys

Not sure about the oathbreaker and mocking the gods part. While Dany was treating with the envoy from Yunkai (Grazdan) before she took the city, she gave them three days’ notice. But she attacked the city at that night. During the parlay, she said dracarys and Drogon set Grazdan’s tokar afire.

&gt; and turns on those who have served her loyally.

Sending Jorah to exile.

&gt; They say her lust cannot be sated, that she mates with men, women, eunuchs, even dogs and children, and woe betide the lover who fails to satisfy her.

The nugget of truth is the “women” and “children” part. She had a hand from Irri at a certain night and she commanded Missandei to join her naked in a pool. The thing with Missandei was not in a sexual manner but it can easily be seen as such for a person who wants to make up such vile calumnies.

&gt; She gives her body to men to take their souls in thrall.

Stormcrows and Second Sons were hired to defend Yunkai against Dany but _somehow_ she won them to her side. Then she starts having an affair with Daario. 

---

Due to the nuggets of truth in these calumnies, they are more dangerous than outright lies. This already looks very bad on Dany but when she comes to Westeros, things will be even worse. She will be coming with dragons, sellswords, ironborn, Dothraki, army of slaves and eunuchs, an evil dwarf proven as a kinslayer and kingslayer, the zealots from the Lord of Light etc. Throughout TWoW, Dany will be battling her way through Essos with a new Fire &amp; Blood mantra she embraced at her final chapter of ADwD. The ugly side of these battles will be multiplied and twisted to present her as a bloody conqueror coming to destroy Westeros.

And finally, one of my favourite pieces of foreshadowing for Dark Dany:

&gt; A body believed to be Rhaenys Targaryen was later found beside the carcass of her dragon, but so blackened that no one could be sure it was her. … the Queen Who Never Was lived fearlessly, and died amidst blood and fire.

The Queen Who Never Was ended up being so blackened that no one could be sure it was her. This is the story of Dany and the readers.

---

__Edit:__ I don’t like to make edits but I forgot to add another thing that will be ill-perceived in Westeros regarding Dany:

&gt; The secret pact that Prince Doran had made all those years called for Arianne to be wed to Prince Viserys, not Quentyn to Daenerys. It had all come undone on the Dothraki sea, when he was murdered. _Crowned with a pot of molten gold_. “He was killed by a Dothraki khal,” said Arianne. “The dragon queen’s own husband.”

&gt; “So I’ve heard. What of it?”

&gt; “Just… why did Daenerys let it happen? Viserys was her brother. All that remained of her own blood.”

&gt; “The Dothraki are a savage folk. Who can know why they kill? Perhaps Viserys wiped his arse with the wrong hand.”

&gt; _Perhaps_, thought Arianne, _or perhaps Daenerys realized that once her brother was crowned and wed to me, she would be doomed to spend the rest of her life sleeping in a tent and smelling like a horse._

Arianne is poised to become Dany’s bitter enemy but even before that, she is thinking the worst about her. She is considering the possibility that Dany deliberately had her brother killed by her husband to remove him from the succession.

&gt; He was an uncle to Queen Selyse and had been among the first to follow her in accepting Melisandre’s red god. _If he is not a kinslayer, he is the next best thing._ Axell Florent’s brother had been burned by Melisandre, Maester Aemon had informed him, yet Ser Axell had done little and less to stop it. _What sort of man can stand by idly and watch his own brother being burned alive?_

These are Jon’s thoughts about Axell Florent. He did nothing while his brother was burned alive by Mel. For all we know, he might have cheered for it. Jon takes this as something close to kinslaying. When he hears the rumors about the death of Viserys, what will Jon think about Dany?",asoiaf
855,"  

This is a thought I had the other day. 

And no criticism meant to George Martin but basically to me it makes zero sense for the Iron Islands to be such a big military power in the books. 

&amp;#x200B;

After Balon’s failed rebellion they should still be feeling the effects of the loss of manpower from their Rebellion and certainly not have the manpower to wage war again during the War of the Five Kings. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although the details about Balon’s Rebellion are scarce there are several things we do know.

\- We know that the Iron Fleet was smashed by Stannis in the Straits of Fair Isle.

\- We know that several Island were subdued and had an invasion force to content with and most likely there were others that we haven’t heard about. 

\- We know that Lordsport and the ships in its harbour were burned. 

\- We know that Balon was fighting to the last and that the castle of Pyke had to be taken by storm. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that it is generally accepted among the fandom that the Iron Fleet has some 10000 men. Now when I read that the Iron Fleet is smashed by Stannis I don’t expect many surviving ships or men So for argument’s sake let’s take that this means a loss of those 10000 men for the Iron Islands. Basically with a few noble exceptions, they drowned as Iron born like to wear armour on their ships or they simply died fighting.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now semi-canon sources put the total military strength of the Iron Islands at 20000, so that means about half their military strength is left. It is my believe that after the Iron Fleet was destroyed that all the normal longboats fled home to defend their islands and from what we know the islands needed to be subdued and taken by force. But in this fighting I can’t imagine that, if not exactly their warriors, not at least another 10000 men were killed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can’t find the source for it but I believe it was Martin who said that the Iron Born raise a higher percentage from the population than the normally accepted 1% for a fighting force. If we put the percentage that they raise at 4% of the population, which I think fits well for a seafaring warrior culture, and as we put this percentage along an early modern demographic pyramid this would mean a loss of about 20% of your adult male population with ages from about 20-60. This would mean a huge loss and not one replaced in nine years and to be a military power they would have to rebuilt their fleets in these years as well next to rebuilding their homes that were destroyed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next to all of the above I’m even leaving out about the probable famine that ravaged the Iron Islands after the invading forces left. 289 ac meant the end of winter so food was scarce. The Iron Born probably plundered quite a bit from the mainland but the invading armies would have taken a huge chunk of everything that was present in the isles in plunder and to feed their forces. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? Lapses in logic on my part or does it not make sense to you as well?

&amp;#x200B;

as a little side note it is my believe that the custom of taking salt wives comes from exactly this sort of problem and that salt wives are a solution to repopulate the Iron Born faster.",asoiaf
856,"Caused by an eclipse? So I've been re-reading the world of ice and fire, and something popped out to my wife and myself - in addition to parallels of the long night around the world (notably the others, or more accurately, ice/winter, are only mentioned in Westeros but necromancy and dark magic is everywhere), we have three additional pieces of evidence:
  
One -
      
There are references to stars, things falling from the sky, and additional celestial bodies at about this same time. One legend even has a second moon in the sky, with dragons coming from them. And, The Bloodstone Emperor (cause of the long night) was a worshiped of an oily black stone and is considered a high priest in the church of ""starry wisdom.""
  
Two -
   
 ""And the maiden of light turned her back upon the world and the Lion of Night came forth..."" And so on. While this could be just referencing darkness, ""turning her back"" feels very intentionally chosen. 
    
Three -
  
Staring is in the face (somewhat literally), the Game of Thrones intro. It's the sun. And it gets darker in season 8, or the others, descend.
  
It's an eclipse guys.",asoiaf
857,"I've been thinking about the blowing up of the Great Sept of Baelor by Cersei. In the show, this kills off important characters such as the High Sparrow, Kevan Lannister, and all existing Tyrell characters save for Olenna. As a result of this, the Reach is then easily sacked and then Cersei gains a crown, as well as an army we know she can never have in the books. 

However as we all saw, there are seemingly no diplomatic consequences or reactions from the small folk...the same small folk who saw her walk naked through king's landing not too long ago. I don't see how this could not lead to other major plot points within this  story. The lack of sensical development from this event leads me to believe that George has nothing to do with this plot point. Also within the same finale episode, we see Daenerys sail for Westeros which means that they probably wanted to quickly eliminate any other major conflicts in Kings Landing as to not confuse the viewers and streamline the plot.

I have seen posts on this subreddit (before I actually bothered to create an account) from people hoping that this will be happening in the books. I don't think it will, as it also seems a little too convenient. It also majorly downplays the threat of the faith militant, I dont think blowing up one building would eliminate them entirely, especially given the trouble it gave the Targaryens.  

A 'sort of' similar event is of course the Red Wedding, but the consequences of those who received power was a ruined reputation and lead to difficulties ruling (which is shown in the show),  and also small folk are generally disgusted. No one buys the lies that were spread regarding Robb turning into a wolf and beginning to attack them. However, after the Sept is blown up, ~~we see Cersei casually explaining to Olenna that it was just a horrible tragedy as if that was some widely accepted truth, when it should have resulted in war immediately and Cersei should have no access to Olenna.~~ This doesn't happen, I confused that scene with a different scene where Cersei claims it was a tragic accident in a conversation between her and an Iron Bank representative.

I do, however, find it believable that Tommen will be driven to suicide so perhaps something really bad does happen to Margaery. I also recall that it was maybe mentioned at some point that the small folk were running out of food, but it was never shown. In fact, I don't recall Cersei leaving the Red Keep. So perhaps we are supposed to just assume they are rioting or acting violent...I am curious to hear other opinions/theories on what may actually happen with the Faith Militant and the Tyrell family plot lines.

**TL:DR** The events following the explosion at the Great Sept of Baelor don't make sense, so therefore I don't believe its likely to be occuring in the books. 

EDIT: I corrected a reference to a scene that doesn't actually happen

Also, thought I would include a link for the ""Inside the Episode"" video for season 6 episode 10 which contains a quote that heavily implies that the explosion may been solely constructed by D&amp;D themselves. Link: https://youtu.be/nRTP9SUkHl8?t=18 0:18-0:27

Nothing else. Jon was a true northener. More Stark than Ned's other children. He made the same decision like Aemon did. (Aemon was part of his raising as well)

If you look back, there was only two big motivation for Jon's character in the entire series. Saving the living against the dead. Done. Finding out who his mother really was. Done.

Nothing else matters to him. And besides, he was choosed King in the North which 100% meant more for him, than the Iron Throne. As i said, he was a true northener, no matter what kind of blood flow through in his veins.",asoiaf

861,"I've come to this theory after wondering why exactly GRRM included a deus-ex machina shadow baby for Stannis and did some digging.

In GRRM's literary style of irony, **Stannis will not become Azor Ahai, he will become the opposite.** GRRM has given us a very strong amount of literary clues and foreshadowing.

Similarities between Stannis and the Night's King:

""Glowing like sunset, a red sword was raised in the hand of a blue-eyed king who cast no shadow.""

**A blue eyed king who casts no shadow is not just a king with blue eyes, it is an Other**. We believe this vision from Daenerys refers to Stannis Baratheon, and its true that it does - with a twist. Here's what we know about the NK and Stannis:

The Night's King:

\-13th Lord Commander

\-Took a strange woman with pale skin as his wife

\- gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well

\-Sacrificed his Night's Watch brothers to the Others

**-Ruled the Nightfort**

And Stannis:

\-Took a strange woman with pale skin as his wife

\-Gave his seed to her and gave his soul as well (the shadow baby)

\-Sacrifices people repeatedly to ""god"", will probably sacrifice Shireen

\-Sacrificed his brother Renly to a shadow demon

**-Has just been sent by Jon Snow to rule.... The Nightfort**

Melisandre is a parallel to the Night's King's wife. In fact, if you accept show cannon that she is far older than she looks, she might even be the very same ice woman. I contend that these characteristics are more than just parallels. **Stannis will eventually become the Night's King.**

**Stannis will turn to ice because the fire betrayed him**. Stannis lost on the Blackwater because of the wildfyre. Stannis will be saved at Winterfell because he will take advantage of the snowy conditions and use them against the Freys and Boltons. Stannis will go to the wall after conquering the North, and he will burn Shireen. Going from Dragonstone (fire) to the Nightfort (ice) also symbolizes Stannis journeying from Fire to Ice and switching sides in the coming war for the dawn.

&gt;Robert was the true steel. Stannis is pure iron, black and hard and strong, yes, but brittle, the way iron gets. He'll break before he bends. And Renly, that one, he's copper, bright and shiny, pretty to look at but not worth all that much at the end of the day.

Donal Noye was right - Stannis will not bend from his goal of ruling Westeros as King, but he will break and join the Others to continue his conquest of the Seven Kingdoms.

Renly was right too in ACOK:

&gt;Stannis: ""The Iron Throne is mine by rights. All those who deny that, are my foes.""  
Renly: ""The **whole of the realm** **denies it**, brother. **All men** **deny it** with their death-rattle and **unborn children deny it** in their mothers wombs. They deny it in Dorne and they deny it on The Wall. **No one wants you for their king**.

All men WILL deny it. And so all men WILL become Stannis's foes and he WILL seek to destroy them as he keeps saying.

We already know the Night's King was sacrificing Night's Watchmen to the Others. We already know that the Others want child sacrifices because of Craster. We already know that Stannis is not shy about sacrificing lives to the gods. We know that Shireen will be burned at some point. **Stannis will sacrifice Shireen for/against the Others echoing the Night's King's sacrifices**. He will join the Other's by giving Melisandre his seed and creating one last shadow baby. It is already established by Mel that another shadow baby would kill Stannis. This will either kill him and turn him into the Night's King or just straight turn him into the NK.

Stannis's attempts to fight the Others to the North are what will actually make them much more powerful when he joins them and leads them. Aemon Targaryen already tells us this in AFFC:

&gt;""Stannis ... Stannis has some of the dragon blood in him, yes. His brothers did as well. Rhaelle, Egg's little girl, she was how they came by it ... their father's mother ... she used to call me Uncle Maester when she was a little girl. I remembered that, so I allowed myself to hope ... perhaps I wanted to ... we all deceive ourselves, when we want to believe. Melisandre most of all, I think. The sword is wrong, she has to know that ... light without heat ... an empty glamor ... the sword is *wrong,* and ***the false light can only lead us deeper into*** ***darkness***\*\*, Sam\*\*. *Daenerys* is our hope.""

Stannis as the Night's King will lead the army of the dead down south killing everyone in their path. Stannis's brother Robert defeated Dany's brother Rhaegar at the Trident and won the war. **Stannis will be defeated by Daenerys at the Trident** \- GRRM's idea literary symmetry. It won't just be Dany though - the Night's King was defeated by one King to the north, and one King to the south. One of those Kings was the King in the North. Jon Snow will play a part in defeating Stannis as the King in the North. There is some sort of parallel to the ruby that Melisandre wears and the Ruby Ford, where Rhaegar's ruby's in his armor scattered after Robert caved his breastplate.

We are repeatedly told in the books that the Others are the greatest threat to the realm, not the War of the Five Kings. Tywin Lannister was right about Stannis too:

&gt;I have felt from the beginning that Stannis was a greater danger than all **the others** combined.

Stannis is that threat to the realm. Also some wordplay on The Others from GRRM.

**TLDR**: Stannis will become the new Night's King after turning from fire to ice. He will lead the Others south and be defeated by Dany and Jon at the Trident, echoing Robert's defeat of Rhaegar.",asoiaf
862,"I was thinking why would Varys presumedly invented that fAegon is Rhaegar's surviving baby son who was smuggled out and switched with a commoner baby from Flea bottom? Many nobles, including the Lannister saw the body and he had all Targaryen physical features. Rhaegar was also excluded from inheriting the throne  by Aerys himself. Wouldn't be better to say that fAegon is Daenerys' twin brother? He could've said that  the Queen died birthing two babies , the children are separated to keep both male heirs safe from assasins. Viserys goes with baby Dany and the ""lost twin"" with somebody else. There wasn't anyone who could've said otherwise. Wouldn't this be more credible for the lords of the Seven Kingdoms that oh he really didn't die  because there was a secret switcheroo?",asoiaf
863,"I may edit this post later because I’m thinking off the top of my head here. Here are the rewrites I’m thinking of. Add on if you wish. Spoilers ahead of you did not already know.

Season 7: This season has 7 episodes per usual. The finale should’ve ended with A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. The only difference would be that Baelish is still alive by the end of it. The whole Baelish trying to get Sansa to kill Arya thing is partially played this season, but saved to be finished by Season 8. 

Season 8: This season has 6 episodes per usual. Episode 1 is the Long Night. Night King dies by end of premiere. 

Episode 2 plays out like the original Episode 4, except when Arya plans to travel south with the Hound, the Hound talks her out of it before she leaves Winterfell. She calls him Sandor as he leaves. End of Episode 2 is Euron destroying Dany’s fleet with the harpoons. Missandei dies on ship rather than be taken hostage.

Episode 3, they all wash up on the beach except Missandei. Arya kills Baelish in Episode 3.

Episode 4 is when Daenerys burns down King’s Landing. 

Episode 5 plays out like the first 40 or 45 minutes of the finale with some extra scenes added. 

Episode 6 starts a few weeks later, added scenes at the council, and properly concludes series.

Provide what you would add in the comments.",asoiaf
864,"When Stannis died in the show I remember a lot of people were mad and felt that his character was wasted. People seem to think that his story still has a lot to offer from where we left off in Dance. 

Personally I think he will probably die early on in Winds. I just read the Theon chapter from Winds, although it seems pretty likely that Stannis will be able to beat/ ally with the Freys and Manderly's he still has no chance of actually taking Winterfell. His army is starving and outnumbered and the weather is against him. To me it seems like what happened in the show was a simplified way to wrap up Stannis' downfall but the main points stay the same. Stannis will eventually lose to the Boltons and the Jon will march to Winterfell and succeed where Stannis failed. 

I hope I'm wrong because Stannis is one of my favorite characters but he seems completely fucked. Can anybody give me reasons to be optimistic about his future?",asoiaf
865,"As Ned said - “Ser Barristan Selmy, I believe no man here could question your honor”, and “[Selmy] is a good man, a loyal man - you will do him no harm!”

So why then does Selmy have no problem with Cersei ripping up “the King’s words”, or with the city watch betraying and jailing Ned, who was the Lord Protector/Regent by royal decree?

Then, in the throne room, just before Sansa takes the floor to plead for mercy for Ned, Cersei calls for Selmy (so she can relieve him of his post on the kingsguard), but before she does, Selmy bows and says “My Queen. I am yours to command”. 

Being respectful of his role on the kingsguard is one thing, but if Selmy was really so honorable wouldn’t he at least have a problem being made a lackey to all the Lannisters’ plainly evil and self-serving bullshit? He just stood by mutely.",asoiaf
866,"D&amp;D and Grrm have said multiple times over years that the endings of the main characters (Jon, Arya, Dany, Sansa, Jaime, Cersei, Tyrion, bran) will be same in books and show. Just before season 8 premiered grrm said on Deadline that the books will not be that different from the show 

We also now know from Isaac Hempstead Wright that King Bran comes from GRRM. And even resident book experts Linda and Elio were proven wrong as in their initial video discussing book vs show endgames they thought no way Bran could be King in the books lol.

I think no matter what you think of D&amp;D, I’m willing to at least bet that they knew these endgames would be controversial. 

I’m sure they knew people would flip at Dany becoming flying Hitler and nuking every street of KL like shes playing fucking Pac-Man and trying to get every single dot lmao.

I’m sure they knew Braime shippers and general audience who wanted Jaime to become a typical hero would cry and seethe at him going back to Cersei and dying with her while still loving her. And not murdering her in some Mad Queen  2.0 scenario because they weren’t planning for Cersei to do something crazy in season 8 anyways. 

I’m sure they knew that people would be disappointed at Jon not ending up as King after all the setup and payoff of R+L=J

blah blah blah the list goes on and on 

Season 8 was an absolute mess in storytelling with rushed pacing, lack of dialogue, lack of logic, bullshit filler scenes, too much focus on spectacle, and lack of and botching of character development.

But the fact remains that D&amp;D have always done way more fanservice than GRRM ever has. In fact, I’d say seasons 6 and 7 were almost purely fan service. There are so many scenes and moments that you can just tell were written for fan memes and tumblr gifs and to go viral on twitter. The Wight hunt episode in season 7 was pretty much purely a meme episode lmao.

**So do I think the books will be different from the show?** 

100% they will be, there’s the butterfly effect, characters that the show cut from the books, the fact that the books are incredibly long and that GRRM is a better and more talented writer than d&amp;d in general. 

**But I just think we should all also be prepared for these things in the books too:**

- Mad Evil Queen Dany nuking KL

-Jaime to backslide, abandon Brienne in some fucked up way and return to KL to Cersei. And even if he does kill her...for it not be some white knight redemptive moment

- R+L= J main purpose in the story to lead to the complete destruction of House Targaryen with Dany going mad and Jon killing her 

- and of course KING BRAN 

I also think it’s a good idea to not set up a certain fixed canon about the upcoming books in your head so it doesn’t feel like a betrayal when it doesn’t happen lol.",asoiaf
867,"Why is Young Griff considered to be a fake Targ? I see people online calling him (F)aegon, but I just finished the books and didn't read anything that seemed like solid evidence. The only time he was called a pretender was in Kevan Lannister's POV chapter.",asoiaf
868,"Ok so I had this idea. What if HBO made a miniseries about Corlys Velarion and his adventures across the world? This would show us places like Ibben, The thousand Islands, YI TI, The summer islands and Asshai. But the show would would mainly set up the extremely cool character of Corlys. 

But the after one season his story is continued in a Spinoff about the Dance of the Dragons. Where the first season would be about the great council and the Black/Green rivalry. And ending with King Viserys dying. Then the following seasons would be about the war, ending with the hour of the wolf. 

Now this is where the miniseries comes in. Corlys is an extremely important character in the dance. Therefore by first giving him a miniseries we would not only get to see extremely cool places but also build the character. Giving him kind of a lead role in the start like Ned before introducing the other characters.

This show would include create characters, backstabbing and plotting (there was a lot). And some of the coolest battles ever (Battle of the Gullet and both battles of Tumbelton ect). There would also be a lot of crazy WTF moment like the red wedding (that would make sense). And a bittersweet realistic ending as well.",asoiaf
869,"You thought Dany was a hero, but she's actually a villain! Surprise!

Why yes, D&amp;D, I am surprised. I'm surprised at how completely and fundamentally you have misunderstood what made Game of Thrones a mega-hit in the first place.

It's okay for your characters to be complicated. In fact, it's a good thing! That's what we fell in love with! 

This is a big part of what makes the books (and the first four seasons of the show) so special. We aren't meant to understand most characters to have a clearly defined hero or villain role. Like in real life, people in this story are seldom entirely good or evil. This lended tremendously to the sense of realism the story once possessed.

Jaime has committed atrocities in the past that many would consider unforgivable. But now, in the present, he strives to do the right thing. Is redemption possible for even the worst of us?

Dany has a strong sense of Justice, but is often blinded by her own conviction and driven to extremes.

Tyrion presents himself as a hero persuasively, but his actions tell a different story.

This extends even to more minor characters. The hound was a good man embittered by a cruel world. Tywin was a good ruler, but a bad man. Stannis is objectively the rightful heir, but he is willing to commit evil to obtain the throne. Does this invalidate his moral authority?

An even better example is a character many of you have probably forgotten about because he was so minor: Steelshanks. Steelshanks is a good man working for evil people. 

Yes, some characters are clearly entirely evil or good. But these are few and far between, and there's almost always a good reason for it narratively. 

In the show, nearly every character is a clearly defined hero or villain

Heros: 
Jon
Tyrion
Sam
Arya
Sansa
Theon
Davos
Etc

Villains:
Cersei
Jaime
Night King
Euron
Dany


Yes, you could argue that ""but because of action x I see character y as a hero/villain even though most people don't"" if you try hard enough to fool yourself. But the narrative clearly intends you to view every character as a clearly defined hero or villain.

The only character I can think of that isn't a clearly defined hero or villain is Bran, and that's because he is just spaghetti.

I guess remaking Lord of the Rings for season 8 seemed like a safe bet. But we've already seen Lord of the Rings. We wanted Game of Thrones.

This is yet another reason you shit the bed D&amp;D. You killed the soul of the story.

Thank you Los Angeles.",asoiaf
870,"I was thinking what would happen if Cersei pushed to the edge by Jaime abandoning her and Tommen siding with Margaery, confessed that Jaime was the father of her children and that the king is a bastard with no claim as a way to spite them, how would the Faith and the lords of Westeros react?",asoiaf
871,"This is something that's been on my mind for a while now since I recently started reading the books. I just finished CoK last week and with SoS on the horizon I've been thinking about the way both father and son's demises play out. Apologies if this is something that gets discussed often.

So who makes the stupider critical errors? Ned or Robb?

I think Ned's two clearest mistakes are 1) letting Cersei know his intentions beforehand and 2) trusting Littlefinger in the first place. Ned was naive in his honor but there was no way he shouldn't have even considered the possibility that Cersei may have an ace up her sleeve. And to LF's credit...he *does* tell him not to trust him.

Then again, Ned had just recently arrived in KL and wasn't fully acclimated to the kind of people he was dealing with. He was a Stark of Winterfell, and as much as I love them all the people he was frequently dealing with were all rather straightforward in their intentions and personalities.

On the other hand, Robb knows full well what kind of man Walder Frey was from his mother. And he knows full well that he directly destroyed Frey's trust. In the show he's even brazen enough to bring his new wife into the man's home.

But - Frey was a house of the Trident who had been relatively loyal to Catelyn's family for her whole life. In the books he takes two of Frey's grandkids as wards and (I don't remember if its expressly stated in the show) he's even fighting alongside the army of the Twins. And also, it naturally must be said, but Robb is still pretty much a kid. For all intents and purposes he had no reason not to trust WF.

So what do you guys think? Bonus for if you have any opinions on where Jon's betrayal falls as well.",asoiaf
872,"&gt;in the books he is a legendary figure, akin to Lann the Clever and Brandon the Builder, and no more likely to have survived to the present day than they have


Now considering we know Bran ends up king in the end, presumably rebuilding from the ashes using his magical ability's, one could make the connection between him and Brandon the Builder.

Tyrion, presumably, ends up the last child of Tywin, presumably obtaining Casterly Rock despite all odds, much like Lann the Clever.

So what if circular history is completely true? Will we see Jon give himself to an Other women, perhaps as a part of a peace pact, and rule beyond the wall?",asoiaf
873,"\*I originally posted this to a different sub, but after finding r/asoiaf and reading the quality of analysis here, I'd love to hear your opinions. Also, this analysis applies primarily to Daenerys from the show, not the books.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I've finished the show, one of the topics I have been pondering is the change in Daenerys's mental state and the concept of ""madness"" in the world of GoT. I've seen a lot of posts here debating her motivations, whether or not she was actually ""mad"", and how much agency she had when she committed her worst crimes. I'd like to discuss it a bit and see what others have to say. Also, nothing in this write-up is meant to diagnose or treat mental illnesses in real life, and I recognize that GRRM isn't an expert on mental illness either; these are fictional characters with (semi)-fictional problems.

For some background, I work in behavioral health and love history, and there are quite a few examples in history of monarchs who struggled with mental illness. Over time, mental illness has been described in  many different ways and definitions have changed. In Daenerys's universe, we have the concept of ""madness."" According to Barristan Selmy, Jaeharys II stated that ""Madness and greatness are two sides of  the same coin"" and that every time a Targaryen is born, the coin is flipped.

The best example of this madness we have in the show are the actions of Aerys II, whose paranoia and  increasingly bizarre behavior completely destabilizes the kingdoms and leads to Robert's Rebellion. Aerys slowly becomes more and more suspicious of those around him, including his own son, and eventually  murders members of the Stark family. He evens holds his son's family as  hostages and prevents them from getting to safety, and meets his end after ranting about dragonfire and threatening to burn everyone and everything.

&amp;#x200B;

So what happened?  When analyzing mental illness, it's important to get a thorough history of when it started and in what context. We can very roughly look at it in terms of more organic mental illnesses (like  schizophrenia/bipolar) or more contextual (conduct disorder in a child who was abused). These are by no means exclusive and heavily overlap in real life.

Aerys came from a family with a purported history of mental illness, had a relatively uneventful  childhood, and began to decline in early adulthood after acts of defiance from unruly subjects. He didn't have a history of extreme  behavioral issues as a child, like the character Joffrey did. All of this evidence points towards a psychotic spectrum disorder, most likely schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is: genetic/heritable, typically has onset in early adulthood, and manifests with delusions, hallucinations, and  disorganized behavior or speech. Aerys checks these boxes, and the kingdom suffered for it.

Aerys's children seem to be variable in terms of their mental health, much like the coin analogy would predict. Rhaegar did not show any evidence of psychosis. Viserys had clear behavioral problems, but in a very different way from his father. He had a completely fractured childhood (homelessness, fear, etc) and was more prone to rage and frustration when he didn't get his way instead of bizarre delusions. This points more towards a looming  personality disorder than psychosis, but we didn't see enough of him to  be sure. That brings us to Daenerys.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite having the same difficult childhood as her brother, Daenerys does not share his impulsiveness or insecurity. For the earlier part of the series, she is cool, calculating, and idealistic. As she gains power, we  see more violent actions on her part (like the crucifixions) but nothing that would be completely out of character for a ruler in this universe. She is driven and wants to help those that she rules. However, in the final season we see a distinct shift. Daenerys slowly becomes more and more paranoid that those around her will attempt to usurp her, which in some cases was warranted. This paranoia begins to spread to her closest advisors, which tragically creates a self-fulfilling prophecy in which one actually does turn on her.

However, the moment that Daenerys starts to manifest the latent mental illness her father suffered from is when Missandei is executed. This event causes significant psychiatric trauma; after all, Missandei was one of the few people Daenerys didn't suspect of treachery. Days later, Tyrion visits her quarters to find her disheveled and disorganized; she appears to be sleep-deprived, isn't tending to personal hygiene, and her plans have become more focused on destruction. This leads to her seemingly  sudden decision to destroy King's Landing and compromise all of the ""liberating"" she had done overseas. Her delusions of paranoia, bizarre behavior, young age, and family history all point to an episode of psychosis.

Interestingly, the next time we see Daenerys, her demeanor has completely changed. She gives a rousing speech to her remaining Unsullied and Dothraki supporters,  appearing energetic and chipper. When Jon visits her before the Iron Throne, she explains her grand plans to liberate the world and be the ultimate decider of what is good and evil, all with a smile on her face. This distinct shift appears to be an episode of mania; her behavior is  no longer disorganized, she is not disheveled, but now has energy, a very bright appearance, and speaks with grandiosity and purpose. While the quick change may appear jarring, it is consistent with a sudden mood episode. The connection between Daenerys's suspected mania and  psychosis is difficult to ascertain; if they are one in the same, she would fit a bipolar disorder with psychotic features picture; if they are distinct, which seems more likely, schizoaffective, bipolar type.  Both are related via genetics to schizophrenia, and both can be devastating to someone with power.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that the Targaryen familial illness has been explored, the last topic I'd like to address is the use of mental illness as a plot device. Since the finale, I have seen quite a good bit of frustration directed at the suddenness of her descent and lack of justification for the degree of paranoia she experienced. Rather than weak story-telling, I would argue that the paradigm of psychosis in media is actually quite backwards. There doesn't need to be a reason, a rationale, a logical flow of events that leads someone to ""madness."" The true tragedy of psychosis is in its unpredictability. While there are plenty of other conditions that are, by definition, brought on by outside forces (like PTSD, which numerous characters in this series exhibit symptoms of), psychosis lurks beneath the surface through a combination of genetics, exposures, and random chance. It doesn't feel as satisfying to see a character act in a way that we find irrational and inconsistent from their arc, but it may actually be closer to the illness humanity has suffered from for millenia.

In conclusion, from what I have seen, the Targaryen ""madness"" does seem consistent with our modern definitions of mental illness, at least within Daenerys's immediate family. Her father Aerys had paranoid delusions and disorganized behavior suggestive of schizophrenia, whereas her brother Viserys displayed evidence of a looming personality disorder, like antisocial or borderline. Daenerys herself seems to have suffered from a psychotic episode followed by lingering mania, which is seen in schizoaffective disorder, and has the appropriate family history and age of onset. Mental illness, and in particular psychosis, is often poorly portrayed in media, and GoT may have shown something that was more true to life than what its audience expected or wanted.

874,"Currently re-reading the series for the first time since reading the books back in 2011/2012. 
Two things I really enjoy this time around:

1: When i read the books the first time, the sensation of driving the plots forward, getting captured in all the developments and intrigues, had me jumping from page to page drinking the story the same manner that Robert Baratheon drinks his wine. 

- This time around, I know where the books are going, and I'm not ""rushing"" towards the finish line in the same manner i did first time around. I'm happy to spend time thouroughly enjoying all the great dialogues of some of my favourite characters like Tyrion, Varys and Littlefinger. I'm able to spot the R+L=J foreshadowing when Ned allows his mind to wander in his POV's. 

- Even minor incidents in the books gets my head wandering off, and makes me think about why George wrote the chapters like he did. Is Mya Stone, the young girl leading Catelyn up the Eyrie,  supposed to be one of Roberts bastards? Sure seems like it. Did I miss that the first time around? You bet. Is it possible that Wallen and Stiv was part of the group that went missing with Benjen Stark, and might Osha know anything about this? It's plausible. Re-reading the books really makes you appreciate the threads that George has carefully weaved.

2: If you have, like me, watched the TV-series after reading the books, your mind might be a bit fuzzy as to how things went down precisely. Re-reading the books certainly gives a couple of moments where you realize that the story ""you have been holding true"", is not the same as the one you read the first time. It's cool to notice these things while your'e reading.

I'm sure a lot of you have had similar experiences. I just wanted to give a plug for the re-read, as I'm sure theres people like me, who ha haven't revisited the greatness of the books.",asoiaf
875,"I can understand that Quentyn's death will have big implications on Dorne's loyalty towards Dany/Aegon, and it might impact whether lords of Westeros perceive Dany as a mad queen through false rumors. Also, the Frog Prince's actions set the dragons free. The importance of Quentyn's death to the general plot is undeniable.

However, is it necessary for ADWD to dedicate so many pages to his journey to Meereen? As entertaining (debatable) as it may be, and subversion of the frog prince trope, the entire travelogue did very little to push the overall plot forward, minus the conclusion with his death. 

If George just wrote Quentyn's journey offscreen, and introduce his party in that Dany POV chapter where he shows up to propose and get laughed at, and then have a Barristan chapter reflecting his death by dragon fire, would it really be too much different?

All the pages saved from the Quentyn chapters could have fit a few more chapters of the battle of Ice and battle of Fire that got pushed to TWOW.

Aside from Quentyn, I also think it's overkill to give almost every Greyjoy a POV. At this point the Greyjoys matches the Starks for number of POV characters, but with less than half the plot importance of the Starks. As entertaining as the Kingsmoot and Greyjoy adventures have been, and incredibly well-written, their stories should have been told offscreen as the Tyrells had been in ACOK/ASOS.",asoiaf
876,"&gt;He had soldiered in the Disputed Lands across the narrow sea, riding with the Second Sons for a time before forming his own company.

**Tyrion V, ASOS**

The group has quite a few Dornish included along with members from all over Essos.

They're hired by Tywin to go ravage the Riverlands, but of course, they end up betraying him and allow Roose to assume command of Harrenhall. 

It's said that sellswords often switch sides, but they switch to the side they think will win. Did they really think Robb Stark was going to gain Independence for the Riverlands and the North? Maybe. But, maybe they also have a long standing blood debt with the Lannisters.

They almost immediately had words with Lannister men upon their arrival.

&gt;The Brave Companions were housed in the Widow's Tower, so Arya need not serve them. She was glad of that; on the very night they arrived, fighting broke out between the sellswords and some Lannister men. Ser Harys Swyft's squire was stabbed to death and two of the Bloody Mummers were wounded.

**Arya VII, ACOK**

Amory Lorch is the one who killed Princess Ellia's little girl. Sort of like how the Golden Company was formed to get a Blackfyre on the throne, the BC could have been formed to avenge the Martell family.

As soon as they do betray the Lannisters, they feed Amory to a bear. He's a highborn hostage and could fetch a big ransom. Typically, a sellsword company would care more about a ransom than killing someone. But, they would have rather just killed him because of what he did to Oberyn's niece. 

Also, Qyburn was initially apart of the BC and now is in the service of Cersei. It's presumed that the skull sent to Doran was just a dwarf's skull. Plus, when people see Robert Strong, Cersei could be outted as a liar if they put together that he's actually the Mountain.

&gt; If Gregor Clegane is alive, soon or late the truth will out. The man was eight feet tall, there is not another like him in all of Westeros. If any such appears again, Cersei Lannister will be exposed as a liar before all the Seven Kingdoms. She would be an utter fool to risk that. What could she hope to gain?""

**The Watcher ADWD**

Also, Doran has a mole in KL that feeds him info,

&gt;Prince Doran took a jagged breath. ""Dorne still has friends at court. Friends who tell us things we were not meant to know. This invitation Cersei sent us is a ruse. Trystane is never meant to reach King's Landing.""

That person could be Qyburn, who seemingly has control over Robert Strong, is close to Cersei and was a member of his brother's sellsword co. With the whole viper and the grass deal Doran and Oberyn had, he could still have connections to the BC.

Does anyone think that was the company that Oberyn formed? Or will we ever see the company he formed?",asoiaf
877,"I think there has been a lot of debate already on who the best fighter were as depicted in the books. Here's my opinion based solely on what was shown in the show

1) Arya Stark - Ability wise towards the end almost unbeatable, most impressive fight resume - killed the NK, entire Frey family, could hang with Brienne in a 1 on 1 spar, and has tools of deception and stealth that most others don't have.

2) Arthur Dayne - Sword of the Morning, I don't think I need to elaborate much on this one. Even though he only had 1 real scene in the show he almost beat half a dozen fighters on his own and the way Selmy and Jamie spoke of him his reputation alone cements his place.

3) and 4) Tie - Oberyn Martel &amp; Sir Gregor Clegane - I put this as a tie because they essentially killed each other in this fight. I would have put Oberyn higher if not for his ""confess, who gave you the order"" antics that led to his death.

5) Khal Drogo - Never cut his hair and never lost a battle. Him ripping out Mago’s tongue in Season 1 was legendary. Unfortunately he never got to go up against Westerosis but he would have been a formidable foe

6) Brienne of Tarth - Defeated the Hound in single combat I think that alone would qualify her for the list. But her fighting skills are on display throughout as she defeats a two handed Jamie Lannister, fights a bear, destroys Bolton men, and makes a mockery of famous knights who vied to be in Renly's Kingsguard

7) Sandor Clegane, the Hound - I think he would be much higher if he had beaten Brienne. I also think he relies a little too much on his strength, I think someone with superior movement like Oberyn and Bronn would beat him. Still very formidable  

8) Jon Snow - Personally my favorite fighter because we saw his evolution over seasons, how he learned and developed his fighting skills based off real life combat situations. The valyrian steel reveal and defeat of the white walker in Hardhome is my favorite scene of the whole series

9) Bronn - Cunning, ruthless, and very quick. Legendary fights in earlier seasons when he was still with Tyrion. Versatility a huge benefit

10) Robert Baratheon - We never got to see him in action in the show but his superhuman strength and fighting skills were highly spoken of by Ned. Gods he was strong then

Grey Worm
Tormund
Jamie Lannister (his skills were never much displayed in the show and then he lost his hand), 
Jorah 
Robb Stark (we never saw him in combat but he was a great commander)

878,"We can all agree that the Sansa/Arya storyline in season seven was pointless and petty, but when Arya scolds Sansa for her letter to Robb she makes a fair point that contradicts her later feelings. When Sansa claims writing the letter was “the only way to save father” according to Cersei, Arya tells her:

“And you were stupid enough to believe her.”

Fast forward to S8E1, suddenly she hails her as the “smartest person she’s ever met.” Really? Why, because she FINALLY realized Littlefinger’s actions were all for himself? Or because she wasn’t fully committed to Dany? Or because she summoned the Knights of the Vale, not in time to spare hundreds of wildling/Northern soldiers lives(and almost Jon’s)? Neither of these take genius intellect. Arya had spent time with men like Tywin and Jaqen, but because the writing demanded that Sansa appear snarky and witty Arya says that she’s the smartest.",asoiaf

If Tywin had been part of Joffrey's assassination, I doubt there is any possibility he would have allowed Littlefinger to have Sansa. To Olenna, Sansa is not a threat, even a potential future ally (I killed Joffrey for you and saw to your escape, no need to thank me). So I can easily believe she would have made that choice. Even if she is reluctant of giving the last (known) heir of the North to the most conniving person in Westeros.

For Tywin, Sansa can only be opposition to the Boltons that he installed, then utterly debase the Boltons' claim to Winterfell once Arya is discovered to be Jeyne Pool.",asoiaf
885,"‘Hyle: The War of the Ninepenny Kings?

Meribald: So they called it, though I never saw a king, nor earned a penny. It was war, though. That it was.’

I can’t help but feel that most fans do not appreciate most of the Lords and Kings are not really as good as you think. Everything the nobles do always goes back to the smallfolk; if you think the Starks has it bad think of all of the regular commoners who lived in the North when Robb Stark declared war, not even to depose a tyrant, not really, he declared the war for revenge. It was *his* father who died nobody else in the North would care, except, they were told to care by their lords, and packed off to war. They went unpaid, uncompensated and most died. What really leads anyone to believe that the actual people of the North even want independence? The Lords want it, because it is beneficial for them, they don’t really care that it will make life harder for the people under them, and they don’t care that the people of the Riverlands were raped and killed, by their own as well. Shoutout to Edmure Tully, who protected his people at risk to himself, in a war he didn’t start. He was treated like an asshole by everyone around, even though he is probably the most moral Lord we’ve seen to date and a clever commander. Even Ned marched against Aerys, although this is more acceptable; the man was going to do something drastic. I don’t think that Lords should never declare war or something, I just feel that they shouldn’t do it for personal reasons. Robb wasn’t really that interested in deposing Joffrey, if you recall the chapter in which the ‘King in the North’ debacle began he technically never said he was against Joffrey as king, he wanted his father’s remains at the time and the basic revenge package. 

As far as Stannis is concerned he was actually trying to depose a tyrant, he went North to save the realm, although it actually put him in a worse position and many people support him (The Stag’s Men). Renly is the worst of them, he just wanted to be King, nothing more nothing less.

Just to clarify, I do like many of these characters, and I understand their problem; it is the same problem as most  Lords in real life: they think that they are more important than the people they’re supposed to rule. Sorry for the long post, I just get sick of romanticising the Kingdom of the North; it is only better for nobles, there are literally no advantages to normal people, it just means food and other things they have grown accustomed to throughout a mutually beneficial relationship with the south costs more.",asoiaf

Sam: ""Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others, but you know are right in the long run. ""

Olly: ""You believe that?""

Sam: ""With all my heart... Try not to worry, Olly. I've been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.""

There's something absolutely wonderful about this exchange!

As soon as Sam says that first line, Olly looks like something clicked in his head. He asks for confirmation and then it totally is solidified in his mind that he needs to stop Jon.

921,"Having done a rewatch of the series I am even more baffled at Tyrion than before. He is not only a treasonous character from Season 7 finale onwards but also incredibly stupid. His ""soft corner"" for Cersei is complete madness. In season 7 finale he apologizes for what happened to her daughter and he also then says that he intends to save his house rather than destroying it. He kind of forgot that this woman legit tried to have him killed twice and he was privy to that. Having a more fresh perspective of his time in KL and all the things Cersei did to him, I simply could not stand that scene between him and her in Season 7 finale.

From Cersei's perspective nothing wrong though since she was playing the game and killing him could get really ugly in that moment.

Then in Season 8 he says ""you are not a monster"" like for real bro? She was a monster while being a mother to 3 children why would she suddenly change with a pregnancy? 

He was treated like shit in King's Landing and his achievements were constantly downplayed. He was insulted, berated and humiliated for being a dwarf all the time by his own family.

Dany was the only person of power who gave him oppurtunity and allowed him to prosper free of prejudice. She gave him respect and recognition, something he desired all his life. Yet he choose to betray her long before she became an evil person. No one should have been happier to see Cersei die than him and he even said that multiple times but yet all his actions clearly show a soft corner for her which is just madness.

Then in the penultimate episode having failed to negotiate with Cersei on 2 occasions, he thinks she would really abandon KL without a fight and no one will have to die. And somehow it's totally cool for her to go scot free for all her crimes because Jaime loves her.

In the end he is simply a treasonous and incredibly stupid character, a downfall from what was one of the greatest characters in all of fiction.

1. **Viking** (TV Series: Both have very likeable characters, lots of action, some nudity and betrayal. These are more or less the only similarities. It’s historically based and I love the era, even if it isn’t at all accurate. The battle scenes usually have more to them, they’re not just slashy slashy ALL the time and Ragnar is such a loveable character, more so than any of the GoT cast even Eddard and Tyrion.)
2. **Kingdom** (Anime: Very similar to GoT, in the kingdom of Qin, a prince  destined to become a king arises, who is hell bent on conquering the seven warring states of china. It is set in ancient China before unification. Kingdom has a fair amount of politics, but it is more focused in battle strategy and war.)
3. **Grancrest Senki** (Anime: Do you like stories of noble, romantic conquest? Epic-style armies resting their lives down because of good guy heroes proclaiming his will for the people? Some light political intrigue as a buffer for the plight that is to come? All of these titles should be serviceable in the above mentioned.)
4. **Arslan Senki** ( Anime: Both involving wars lords and action also with comedy in it. Seems to be a very similar premise, where a charismatic, but weak individual gathers up others, stronger or more knowledgeable people to help accomplish their vision and goals that may go against the grain of the current prevailing forces.)
5. **Drifters** (Anime: Both have war and battles. Although GoT is Fictional but Drifters have historical figures uniting against a common enemy. If you like these things, go watch.)
6.  **Overlord** (Anime: Very much like GoT, In both anime protagonists try to build up a new Kingdom in hopes of conquering existing kingdoms. Both have magic, war and resurrection in common.)

928,"[SPOILERS FOR BOOKS] So this just occurred to me after finishing the Storm of Swords, the scene in which Sam and gilly were trapped in a house by wights and undead Small Paul attacked Giny and the baby and Samwell tried to stab him with dragonglass but it has no effect, paul doesn't even flinch. Later after making his way to castle black, samwell tells everyone about this and Maester Aemon, Melisandre and others conclude that obsidian is only effective against Others whereas normal steel and fire are sufficient for wights. So in the shows the character conquest for mining dragonglass is utterly pointless as during the battle of Winterfell, not one character fights with a white walker. Only arya uses an obsidian dagger against NK but we know that the Night's watch had like 10-15 obsidian daggers so that were sufficient for getting the job done.

Spending almost all my time since 2011 practically worshiping this series, and I will most likely continue until the end of my days, I find myself thinking a lot about what has happened from ""Winter is Coming"" to ""The Iron Throne"". And I fit somewhere in between not liking the ending character arcs to thinking it's satisfactory. Here is my main character breakdown of what was right and/or what was wrong:

&amp;#x200B;

Jon - Has always been my favorite (Go House Stark!!... Or Targaryen?) and he has been the most noble of them all regardless of all the trials put before him. There is just something not full about his character. I feel like if he were to kill Dany then he should have killed himself, or even said ""dracarys"" for treason and breaking an oath. But it contradicts all other oaths that he has made like protecting the realm. Regardless, I feel like he should have killed himself. (I know, I'm just trying not to be bias)

&amp;#x200B;

Dany - My second love of my life. Well, she did what she has always wanted to do and just completely destroy the crap out of King's Landing. But doing this has made it to where her army was doing things she was completely against, like raping the villagers. Then she became a Tyrant even before the Kings landing battle but saying she’s going to kill all tyrants? Unsullied probably should have killed her at that point for being another tyrant and that may have been justifiable.

&amp;#x200B;

Sansa – Don’t really have many words about Sansa. She is like Dany in a lot of sense, but Sansa is Dany late in the series while Dany matured early. But I feel like Sansa is more careful than Dany and she tries to play by ear to feel the crowd. I feel that Sansa should be alive, but I feel like more things should have challenged her. Dany trying to kill her for example, or in prison for treason temporarily.

&amp;#x200B;

Arya – Should she have killed the Night King? We want that battle between Night King and Jon, and I feel that battle should have happened, but ultimately, I feel Arya should have killed him. She is the hidden weapon that the Starks needed for survival. Teamwork for the win! She is cocky and I don’t like that and I feel like she should have acted more like Brienne of Tarth when it came to her sexuality. She isn’t a lady after all and that was supposed to be an important thing to her, but if she did do it then she should have stayed with Gendry. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ned Stark – I’m disappointed that he did not rise in the crypt…

&amp;#x200B;

Bran – I don’t think he should have been King, maybe an advisor or such cause of his ability but it just makes him completely OP. It wouldn’t matter who sits on the throne because if they have Bran then they just win cause of his sight, but if he were to stay in the North, it would keep everyone from invading cause he would know. The North would have been safe for at least 60 years, though I can say it’ll be safe while even though he is on the Throne.

&amp;#x200B;

Clegane – I would have liked to see that his fight with his brother was not the end to his story. They could have added more by setting sail with Arya as a shipmate or whatever. Or brought him back to his house he was building to finish it, and start farming. Farmer Clegane, sounds right.

&amp;#x200B;

Varys – I understand killing him but it should have been done differently. I would have liked to see how a dragon eats rather than burn things. And I feel like Varys and Littlefinger should have changed places, though not die in season 7 and kept working in the favor of the Starks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Greyjoys – Both of them were poorly thought out. Though I’m happy for Theon, Yara was the weak link. Where was she in Kings Landing’s fight? Still holding a retreat for an army that’s not coming anymore? 

&amp;#x200B;

Cersei – Season 1-7 she was the most evil person in Westeros, why was her character lacking so much? She didn’t even do anything besides order someone else to cut someone’s head off and lied about the baby daddy. Was there even a baby? That would have been an interesting twist. And what’s the timeframe between all of these events from season 7 to season 8? A little math suggests that a few months should have past and it looked like she wasn’t showing at all from when it was mentioned she was pregnant in season 7.

&amp;#x200B;

Jaime – Not much to change or talk about, its Jaime. And I don’t think his character was hurt any in season 8.

&amp;#x200B;

Tyrion – Tyrion was such a careful person in all the other seasons and he just gave up. He didn’t try to influence very much he just did as he was told and watched the aftermath. I think he should have had a larger role. He defended Kings Landing during the Blackwater he should have worked on both defending and invasion. What they did right was him talking to Jon to convince him to kill Dany, what they did wrong was how closed of a person he was. I can see why they turned that way, Season 7 kind of suggested that that was the way he was going but he should have developed different.

&amp;#x200B;

Robin – My, you have grown up so much. But you’re still disgusting despite all the character adjustments. Blaming your mom.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what was missing? It was the Games that was missing. The head games, the trying to use their minds to defeat each other. The only persons that seemed to have it together was Varys and Sansa, and all the others are masters at it. Cersei should have played it out saying that as long as she kept her titles (minus being Queen) there didn’t need to be a war and the Throne could have been Dany’s , new generations do not need to be punished for past crimes, Dany would be advised to accept. While at a gathering in a neutral territory, to celebrate on the same day, Varys should have taken the idea from the Frays and created a new Red Wedding while working with Cersei. Tyrion should have known something like this would happen and meanwhile try to play his own game to counter but fails, secretly happy about it. This would have upsetted everyone in the North and the Unsullied and Jon should have then became commander of the army rather than King. Drogon, being a smart dragon, should still show grief but I think in a more destructive way like burning Kings Landing and Jon, being Targaryen, could have retamed or settled the grieving Drogon. Then the secret of him being the true heir and being a Targaryen could have came out. Though still not accepting his throne, he nominates a King, kinda leaning towards Gendry (don’t hate me). That would be a better game. This is my opinion and I hope you guys liked this last paragraph too.",gameofthrones

945,"I recently started watching the series “Attack On Titan” on Netflix and from the first episode on I was thinking: That’s how you handle humans fighting a completely overpowered villain!
You actually see the titans be incredibly strong and nearly undefeatable, especially the really big guys and have them kill a fifth of their population. You make the walls both a good line of defense but also kind of a trap if the titans were to break through. With strategic points and many layers of wall you can somehow contain the intruders, retreat and have a little more time to think of a good strategy and attach again. This is a real battle that takes a lot of time, thinking and courage. 
You see the average townfolk being victims of the war like getting killed, suffering from food shortages (for a longer period of time) and from the constant fear of an attack. GOT kind of showed that, although it could have been done better. But that plays in to the whole argument of there being not enough time in the whole last season, so that’s not my biggest point here.

I’m just saying, D &amp; D could have learned a lot from “Attack On Titan” when it comes to making the threat of a nearly omnipotent power both realistic and defeatable.",gameofthrones

I remember the first time I saw this thinking that this guy was just an ass who hated Jon Snow.  Now I realize that he was actually a very honorable man and he made Jon Snow into the man he was in the end.  

He was a tough man, but he needed to be.  He had the job of taking criminal low lives and high borns and turning them into men of the knights watch.  The knights watch doesn’t have many soldiers so the few that they have need to be good.  He’s basically the drill Sargent who gets in your face and calls you a walking pile of pig shit because he wants to make a man out of you.  The speech he gave at castle black before the wildlings attacked and the way he charged straight into battle with his men makes you realize that the nights watch truly meant everything to him.  Just as it did to Qhorin Halfhand, another great character. 

I remember watching Dolorous Edd getting stabbed in the back while picking up Sam Tarly’s fat ass off the floor and thinking “I guess Jon sticking up for Tarly in season one during his training might not have been the best thing to do after all”.  

He even taught Jon Snow a lesson when he stabbed him.  Before being executed Thorne told Snow “I had a choice Lord Commander, betray you or betray the nights watch” he went on to say “if I had to do it all over knowing where I’d end up, I pray I would make the right choice again”. A lesson that came in handy when Jon was put to the similar choice in the end.   Betray Daenerys or betray the people of Westeros, knowing that killing her would mean almost certain death by Drogon. 

Just my thoughts...",gameofthrones

952,"Hi there :) 
This is a short comment on how the writers of Game of Thrones intened to continue the character arc of the Unsullied ... enjoy :) (warning again: I'm being very flat-jokey)

__________________________________________________________


So … by the end of Game of Thrones, Grey Worm and a number of other Unsullied set sail for the island of Naath to protect it’s people from further slavery, as he has promised to Missandei.
Unfortunately – this idea is rather naaith.
 
(You think this is a bad one? I just started XD)


Now, of course the Unsullied could succeed in sending one or two slaver ships back to their cities with ¾ of the men on board slain… but to send an army outnumbering them by 10 soliders each and take it back would probably take the slavers of Essos naa leth than a week. 
Not only that, but as revenge for being so naathty,, the slavers could simply take half of the island’s population, or even murder them along with the army. 


Of course, it’s not like naathing  can be done to fullfill the promise … but it would take a while. In my mind, the best option for the Unsullied would be to return to Mereen/Dario and try to fulfill Daenery’s vision of a more just Essos… if enough Dothraki returned with them, they would have a start of an army, and could proceed with trying to win more people with influence for their cause … it’s a very difficult task in the free cities that will require a lot of luck, but it’s much more benaathicial to everyone (potentially) involved, and Grey Worm would help building a world Missandei would have liked.


Plus, whoever he meets as a new love interest – naathing compares to her.

Thanks for reading :)",gameofthrones
953,"Not sure I've seen this specific line discussed. S5E2 Ser Barristan, ""But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved, and each time it made him feel powerful and right until the very end.""

&amp;#x200B;

The people who keep saying Dany would never have slaughtered Kings Landing need to re-watch the show. The signs are  there the whole time..there just disguised as her being the hero. The quote above says it all. Every time she gives someone the justice she thinks they deserve, she feels more powerful and right. She has gone through so much during her journey, and it all goes to hell at the very end. She loses her most trusted advisers, Jorah and Missandei. One to the the ultimate evil against men, the other by a brutal beheading from her enemies. Dany is betrayed by her other adviser in Varys, because the man she is in love with and who can no longer love her back is ultimately the true heir.. a total screw you to her entire life meaning. And finally, Westeros does not share any of the love she thought she would receive. Alll she really does have is fear to rule with, and a goal to break the wheel. While the goal may be commendable, she thinks that what she's doing to break it is right, because her past has taught her so. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do think the show botched the visualization of how Dany slaughtered Kingslanding in S8E5. It was epic for sure but the show should have made it a point for the audience to see more of the Lannister army and Golden company littered throughout ALL of the city. Instead of it looking like shes just killing the innocent for the sake of revenge, it should have looked like they were casualties of war.

957,"I'm still trying to process what we got in Season 8. I have the same complaints that most people do about Season 8 in that it was *incredibly* rushed and the writers seemed to miss several beats necessary to make characters' actions believable (though I'd been complaining about that since Season 7, to be truthful).

But what I'm really wrestling with is the note the series ended on.

Daenerys's sinister turn took the show in a pretty dark direction. To be honest, I wasn't surprised that neither Jon nor Dany ended up on the throne given *Game of Thrones's* history of giving us something your usual fantasy wouldn't. *But* I was very surprised at how we arrived at our ending (I thought they'd abdicate).

My issue is that Dany's turn is dark. Jon's assassination of her is dark. But then, suddenly... it's pretty happy, considering? Bran is king. Tyrion becomes Hand. Sansa is Queen in the North. Jon doesn't get pegged with a job he never wanted and goes to the place his heart has always called him (if Ghost, his familiar, being sent up there early wasn't an obvious hint, I don't know what is).

Was anyone else thrown off by this? Especially since Tyrion was acting like it was a sour outcome (D&amp;D seemed to appoint Tyrion meta-commentator since all his speeches seemed constructed purely to fill in the gaps in the writing).

But let's rewind for a minute.

Bran is king. Bran, the guy possessed by an omniscient spirit of a race once violently opposed to humans, the very race that created the White Walkers to wipe out humanity. Bran, the guy who only revealed that he could see the future all along *after* he'd been nominated as king. Bran, the one who encouraged Sam to plant the seed that caused the discord between Jon and Dany that presumably fueled her descent. Bran, who flash fried Hodor's mind. Bran, the Three-Eyed Crow (""All crows are liars,"" says Old Nan).

But no one says anything about it! Not one person says, ""We need to talk about Bran.""

Wouldn't *acknowledging* the inherent shadiness of Bran-as-child-god-king be--tonally, at least--more in step with the tragedy of the Targaryens? Wouldn't making us feel uneasy about his rule from a place of ""this is dark"" be better than making us feel uneasy because ""we're leaving you with a ton of unanswered questions about Bran but tell you you're supposed to feel happy about this"" feels hollow and instructive?

Don't get me wrong--there were aspects of the season I could appreciate in spite of my criticisms, and I don't dislike Bran. If anything, I like him and am upset at how underutilized he was. But the tonal shift of the last episode midway through was so dramatic for me I can't help but wonder if it would've been better if Bran had been depicted as a darker figure, and whether George had those plans for him (if he ever finished writing the books). I remember his original outline saying that Bran and Jon became bitter rivals and Bran begins to use magic for magic's sake, which makes me think George had planned him to become corrupted by his powers.

I guess I thought I'd just see if anyone was as thrown off by the shift of the finale as much as I was, and whether you think going even darker could've been a solution.",gameofthrones

959,"This may have been done before, but before episode 6 of the last season I had never thought about it.

Jon Snow vs Greyworm

I probably would have always picked Jon until their little encounter with Greyworm assassinating the remainder of Cersei’s soldiers.  Jon almost looked afraid of Greyworm.

Thoughts on who is the better fighter?",gameofthrones
960,"First of all, how did you expect them to kill the night king? He had to die somehow before the real war (on episode 5).
To me it was surprising because I expected like always that Jon will come out from nowhere and save the day like he always do. I was so happy when he didn't.
Arya deserved it, and the whole episode being dark was on purpose, to desperate the watchers and show them how the soldiers felt during the long night against the white walkers. Also the track ""The Night King"" by Ramin was freaking amazing and the visuals were outstanding.
You can tell that the writing was trash and the battle decisions they made were dumb, like sending the whole Dothraki first to the giant army of the dead so they'll join them, but what else could they do? The army of the dead are like a gang of bees, going together to the same target like a tsunami, nothing could've stopped them.

And for episode 5 of Daenerys going mad, it really made sense to me. She lost EVERYTHING.
Jon couldn't keep 1 secret that Ned kept for a decade+
Sansa and Arya hated her.
The whole north hates her.
She lost 1/2 of her army in the long night.
She lost jorah.
She lost Missanderi (whatever you spell her name)
She lost 2 dragons.
Jon said he can't be with her as a husband.
Westros wanted Jon as king.

She had all the reasons to go mad, after she easily managed to destroy the whole army of Lannister and Greyjoy with a single dragon.

Really pissed me off that she got killed on episode 6.

1) Did Ned know his sister married Rhaegar? I don’t believe Ned knew Lyanna was pregnant when he found her. Their marriage was a secret only a few people knew. I’m wondering if Ned knew Jon as a true Targaryen or as a bastard?

What was the point of Rickon at all ? He was introduced as a little kid. Had little to no dialogue as far as I remember, dissappeared for almost all seasons, then appeared again only to be killed by Ramsay in a way that served no purpose.

967,"I’ve been thinking quite a bit about the finale and wanted to gather my thoughts. Correct me if I have inaccurate basis for these please.

We all watched Jon and Danerys fall in love. We all saw what seemed to be the unraveling of D’s sanity. We all saw Jon Snow stab her. We all know Jon Snow and his vows he holds with honor. 

In the beginning of the season we saw Jon and Dany by the waterfall. Dany said they could stay 1000 years and nobody would know. She also mentioned how her dragons hated the cold and lack of food. 

Jon is loyal to two things his family and his queen. Danerys is loyal to her goal breaking the wheel. Assuming Jon never stabbed Dany he would have let his family down and in essence betrayed them had he married Dany. Had Dany married Jon took the throne she would have been strengthening the wheel not breaking it. 

How do these two characters madly in love both meet there goals and stay true to there moral compass. Easily pull off the power move of the century. 

Let’s rewind in order to exist for 1000 years in hot universe one has to die first and come back to life. Jon died and his body was protected until he was brought back to life. In theory wouldn’t Danerys have to suffer the same fate in order to stay with Jon 1000 years.

Danerys trust one person besides herself she trusts Jon Snow. Danerys isn’t dumb or silly or foolish. She is a calculated Khalessi. The knight king wanted to kill Bran to kill the memories of man. What if Khaleesi killed Kings Landing and the Red Keep and the iron throne to do the same. 

Danerys was isolated when she died. Jon told her he would always be his queen as she preached about them breaking the wheel. Greyworm and the Dothraki would have insisted on post death customs. Jon sat with his love and protected her while Drogon destroyed the highest ideaology of the wheel the Iron Throne then gently carried her to exactly where she wanted to be with her wheel broken and with Jon Snow in Valyria for 1000 years and no one will find them .

Wheel broken only person who would want to seek Jon or Danerys out on his way to certain death on Naah.",gameofthrones

970,"This is my alternate ending for the White Walker plot. Most changes are to episode 3 with one small change to episode 2. Not all of these ideas are mine, some are inspired by other theories and rewrites that I have read. I did this for fun, I am not trying to do a better job than D&amp;D. So here goes:

Episode 2 stays mostly the same. The only difference is that at the end Sam tells Jon something he discovered about the Night King. The audience doesn't hear what it is. The only thing we do hear is Sam saying 'Don't tell Bran'

Episode 3 remains the same untill the last half hour. The only characters who's stories are different are Jon, Bran, Arya, Theon and Beric. The dragon battle between Jon, Dany and the Night King remains the same. Arya being chased through the castle remains mostly the same, except it is only the Hound that saves her, without Beric. They don't run into Melissandre and instead go to save the helpless people in the crypts. Arya clears out the wights in the crypt with ease, The Hound is impressed with her skill but is also mad that she didn’t leave any for him. At one point, Sansa kills a Wight with her dagger, Arya sees this and has a proud sister moment.

During the battle, Bran looks into the past to figure out how to beat the Night King. He sees a Stark ancestor standing up to the dead with a dragon glass sword (Implied to be Azor Ahai). He also goes back to the time of the Mad King and tries to convince him to prepare for the threat of the White Walkers. This goes horribly wrong, the Mad King begins to repeat 'Burn them all' and becomes obsessed with burning people. Bran returns to the present, exhausted.

Jorahs and Lyannas deaths remain the same, as does most of the main battle. The living are being overwhelmed by the sheer number of Wights. Jon is fighting his way through the battle. His choice to not save Sam is more emphasised, to show Jons story of choosing duty over love. Jon ducks behind a rock to avoid the blue flames of Viserion. He is joined by Beric, who tells him to get to the godswood. Before Jon can say a word, Beric runs at Viserion giving Jon time to get past. Beric dies.

Brans bodyguards are getting overwhelmed by the wights. Bran, now desperate, wargs back to when the Night King was created. Theons sacrifice plays out the same. Theon goes down, his eyes wide, grabbing at the dragon glass spear in his stomach.

In the past vision, Bran is standing in a field when he is grabbed by the Children of the Forest and tied to a weirwood tree. A dragon glass dagger is stabbed into his heart and his eyes turn blue. Bran didn't listen to the previous Three Eyed Raven’s warning of getting too enamoured with the past and paid the price. Bran opens his eyes to see the Night King standing over him. There is nothing of Bran left in the Night King, not really. The Night King is only here to ensure his creation because he has learned his lesson; to never tamper with the past. A voice calls out Brans name.

Jon runs through the godswood, strangely The White Walkers allow him to pass. Jon repeats 'Bran!' looking at the Night King. Jon knows of Brans fate. Jon pleads with the monster that used to be his brother to stop. The Night King ignores Jon, not even turning around. Jon means nothing to him. The Night King draws his blade and raises it, to stop Bran from going back into the past again to change his fate.

Jon lunges at the Night King. The Night King lazily parries the blow and knocks Jon to the ground with ease. Jon gets back up and attacks the Night King again, desperate to keep him away from Bran. Despite being outmatched, Jon keeps fighting, even managing to disarm the Night King. However, the Night King is too much for Jon in the end, grabbing Jon by the throat and lifting him into the air. As the Night King chokes the life out of Jon, the camera shows various beloved characters being overwhelmed by Wights, facing their doom.

Theon thrusts what's left of his dragon glass spear into the Night Kings back, piecing his heart. The White Walkers burst into shards of ice, the Wights crumble. The Night King lets go of Jon and falls against the weirwood tree. The blue glow leaves the Night Kings eyes. The Night King looks up at Jon and Theon without speaking a word, his real eyes, Brans eyes say a silent thank you. The Night King bursts into shards of ice.

Theon collapses, Jon catches him. Bran forgives Theon, telling him that he is a good man. Theon dies in Jons arms, redeemed not just as a Greyjoy but as a Stark.

Melissandre walks up to Jon, telling him that while the Great Other has been defeated, the long night is not yet over. She turns and walks away. Jon asks her where she is going, she tells him that she has played her part, but he has yet to play his. Melissandre takes off her neckless. Time catches up to her as she walks into the sunset one last time.

973,"So Daenerys's Vision in Season 2 Episode 10 of the HBO adaptation. I am sure many of you have noticed that it is the ruined King's Landing, but I have seen many people wondering why it seemed King's Landing did not end up a snow-covered ruin that they appeared to be showing.

Now I have, since seeing the finale, come up with two hypotheses:

1.) ***Ashy Throne Room***

This is just as it sounds: the thing we thought was snow was all along ash. This seems likely, I mean it looked more like ash than snow but that could just be because of lighting or set issues in the shot. This would mean that it was *literally* showing Dany what was going to happen at the end of her life. Dany saw the wreckage of King's Landing after her arrival. She was shown what her last act ever would be: the destruction of King's Landing.

2.) ***Winter Triumphs***

* *The Outcome.* Now this one is less direct. It revolves around how in the end, the Stark's gained all the power (only for now in The Kingdoms, but yes, but they did). A Stark rules at The Wall, a Stark rules The North, and a Stark rules The Six Kingdoms. King's Landing, a husk of its past self, ruled by winter. Dany's destructive power demonstration set the stage for her downfall and the Stark rise.
* *The Death.* Now there is one thing I think holds true of this vision no matter what way you look at it; it is a death vision. Daenerys is witnessing where her life will end and where she will next meet her lover and her child. She was unable to sit in the throne just as she was unable to ever take her seat there in the very end. This being known, the snow could be simply be representative of the fact that Jon Snow was the man who rang in her death. He brought the end before she could ever reach her final goal.

This is all opinion and stuff I have come up with on my own. I had no intention of basing this off anything else out there, and it is simply meant as some food for thought.

974,"What’s so badass to me is that you don’t need dragons, armies, assassin abilities, good fighting skills, etc to get very far or win the game of thrones. Don’t get me wrong all these things are cool too but what intrigues me the most is the power of the mind. My favorite Pokémon type has always been and always will be Psychic lol. I have always resonated with characters that are more brain than brawn (probably because I’m a nerd 😂) and Sansa and LF definitely showcase this the best. Bran does too but Bran just has hacks and he’s fairly boring. To me what’s so awesome is that this entire Lannister Stark conflict, the main plot of the whole series, the whole war of the 5 kings, nearly everything was caused by 1 person. Only 1 mind. All LF was, was a damn lord of a extremely minor holding on the Fingers, and he causes the whole damn thing and in the end he nearly had half of Westeros (as far as land goes) under control. And what’s so cool was that the only reason he really loses was to himself. He lost to his student so to speak.

What’s so epic is that dragons, armies, etc don’t matter when you play the game of thrones. The only real power is knowledge. As LF says, knowledge is power. True power, real power comes from the mind. LF was legit playing everyone and was playing the game of thrones the best until his student betters him. He was the player and everyone else was the pawns until Sansa. Now Sansa is the player of the “game”. To me my favorite part of Game of Thrones is the Game of Thrones. Is it just purely by coincidence that Sansa got exactly what she wanted (The North’s Independence) since the beginning of Season 8 by the end and is arguably the biggest winner of the “game”? Sansa knew how to play the game from her teachers and she played it well. You win the Game of Thrones by playing the Game of Thrones and Sansa is the most experienced player in the end. What I really love about Sansa is she is like the “Good LF” so to speak and what’s really awesome is that she showcases all of her teachers (LF, Cersei, Margaery, Olenna as well as herself) when she plays the game. I also think Sansa’s arc is awesome, going from a bratty naive girl to a smart, hardened and learned individual. She goes from not appreciating her family and her home to loving her home and her family more than ever, willing to do anything to protect her home and her family. 

I also love Littlefinger’s accent. Just like Sansa’s beauty is like the cherry on the sundae , Littlefinger’s accent is like the cherry on the sundae. He also has some amazing quotes. The “Chaos is a Ladder” speech scene is one of my favorite scenes of the entire series. I also really love the “Conspiracy” Theme that plays several times when he is on screen. Although it’s not technically his theme because it is played in other parts of the show that doesn’t include him, some people call it his theme (myself included) because it is most associated with him and because for the most part it plays when it involves him. It has a very ominous tone and I love it. Littlefinger is a very ominous and mysterious character and it’s what makes him so awesome and intriguing. Also Fun fact about Littlefinger was that he made his personal sigil a mockingbird. It’s cool because he knew the right things to say to the right ears at the right time which is analogous to how a mockingbird mimics and imitates other birds songs.",gameofthrones

978,"I know the last season gets a lot of hate, and deservedly so (writing was subpar, rushed the heel turn with so few episodes, and the fact GoT died when it became more about spectacle than nuance), but Tyrion’s/Dinklage’s acting was incredible. His final goodbyes with Varys and Jaime were nothing short than heartbreaking. 

Varys “Goodbye old friend”
Tyrion, looks up at him, grabs his arm, has no words. (And the music too! Incredible)

Me, crying uncontrollably

Tyrion standing over Jaime sitting “you’re the only one who didn’t treat me like a monster. You were all I had” Jaime with tears in his eyes looking up at Tyrion  and then the best hug ever between them. 

Me, absolutely bawling

That’s 9 years of friendship/family saying goodbye to each other one last time. And it was absolutely heartbreaking. Bravo Peter Dinklage and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau for amazing work!

979,"Today I watched Roose Bolton getting killed by his son. Ramsay then let his men send letters to the other houses that Roose was poisoned by his enemies. After Ramsay was killed in the BotB I think no person that is still alive knows that in fact he wasn't poisoned  but killed by his own son. I then thought that there have to be other very important cases where we as the viewers know what happened but that are forgotten in the show world because there is no one still alive who was there which makes it quite interesting or sad, depends on the case. The one thing that came to my mind was Joffrey being poisoned by Olenna Tyrell. There were probably some people within House Tyrell who know but it got erased in S7 and the only one Olenna told it was Jamie (who then told it Cersei) but they aren't alive anymore. I don't think the Lannisters would spread this because Cersei wanted everyone to believe that Tyrion killed him. Also, you could add Cleganebowl as Arya probably knew it was gonna happen but doesn't know how it ended.

981,"In regards to Season 8 Episode 5 The Bells, everyone wants to talk about Daenarys and her role in the decimation of King's Landing. I want to talk about Drogon and his role up until then. He went from beloved child, very quickly to protector, and vanquisher of evil doers..and then he burned a child to death in Season 4 Episode 10's The Children..and subsequently disappeared (appearing briefly over the ruins of Valyria, mid-season, to a wide eyed Tyrion, and brokenhearted Jorah) until Season 5 Episode 9's appropriately named Dance of Dragons. There we see our future Mad Queen mount our favorite dragon, for the first time. 

Why did he disappear? He was gone before Rhaegal and Viserion were chained in the tombs beneath Mereen, so that wasn't a factor. I have an explanation..guilt. He felt bad. He knew what he had done was wrong. Think about it. He had only killed murderers, tormentors, in defense of his mother. He had never harmed a child. 

Now..fast forward to the events of The Bells..what was asked of him. If this dragon was capable of enough guilt at killing one little girl..imagine the torment at citywide annihilation. I believe that was first conveyed at his initial sighting of Jon coming to the ruins of the Red Keep. Drogon had always conveyed dominance towards Jon. Not this time. That is also why I believe that he allowed Jon to live, following the death of his mother. He knew the act was justified. The Iron Throne truly was what killed her..and her child knew that better than anyone.

TL;DR Drogon felt guilty about burning KL, and, while devastated at the loss, allowed Jon to kill Daenarys, because he knew she had it coming.",gameofthrones
982,"A lot of the post that have the [NO SPOILERS] bracket on them actually have spoilers in them, I don’t know of any examples, even if I did I wouldn’t point them out bc that would spoil stuff. But I know a lot of the artwork that people make and then post on here say no spoilers but it’s artwork of characters, either two or more characters together or just a certain character that someone drew. Most of the post that say no spoilers that actually have spoilers (that I can think of right now) are the artwork post. A lot them aren’t spoilers but only for people that have seen most/all of the show. There’s so many that show things/ people that happen later on in the show and would spoil things for people that are just now starting out the show. I mean when I started watching it, around season 3-4 I found out about this sub and started looking at it occasionally. And I started watching the show about 2 weeks before the 8th season started. I caught up to the actual show super fast. I started watching the live episodes on episode 3, so if I started 2 weeks before (which was actually closer to a week before), but my point is that when I started looking at this sub there were a lot of post that said no spoilers they aren’t hidden/ blurred out like the ones that say spoilers, that actually spoiled things for me. It’s like the rule was you only had to put spoilers if it was a major spoiler or if it was obviously a spoiler. Many of them spoiled things for me, like I said before a lot of the artwork were the main things that spoiled things for me. I saw some guy the other day post that he was just starting the series and it made me think about how it he were to look through the sub, there’s a high chance that things would get spoiled even if he didn’t look at any of the [SPOILERS] post, like I did. I did end up looking at some of them just from my own curiosity but if they spoiled something for me, I was okay with it because I knew I was doing it to myself but the ones that said no spoilers and then ended up having a spoiler were the ones that really upset me. Basically if your post says/shows anything that happens in the show it should say [SPOILERS], because a lot of what people doing consider spoilers are spoilers. Does anyone else agree with what I mean? 

TDRL; a lot of the post (mostly artwork) that have the [NO SPOILERS] brackets should have the [SPOILERS] brackets because they end up containing info/pictures of things that happen in the show.

983,"IM NOT HERE TO START ANYTHING, I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE DIDNT LIKE IT. 

I don’t get what made the ending so bad? Everything made sense to me. Dany loses her best friend, has the ability to burn down everything in revenge, and then does it? Like yeah i wish she didn’t, but who could help a person who felt angry and had to make a hard decision to hold back from that? She was grieving, and i’d imagine if you lost someone close to you, you’d be angry too and hurt everything. especially if you had a freaking dragon bro.  It’s in her blood, and she had power go to her head and make her become the villain. 

also why are people upset that Bran became king? like yeah it was sorta stupid when he said “why do you think i came all this way” okay yeah whatever. i heard the H3 Podcast say how “what’s the point of revealing Jon as a Targaryen and him going to the north?” They turned it into a democracy, if that’s the right word, having everyone vote for a king. I feel like the point was to show, “screw whatever house/name you’re from, screw your wealth, your power, all of that. Let’s just choose a wise king that we all agree on rather than let our foolish children be the next one to rule and mess things up” just as Tyrion pointed out. If Jon was king, the Unsullied, Ironborn, and anyone else loyal to Dany would fight against Jon. Creating another war. Jon wanted the killing to stop. Everyone wanted the war to stop, Ser Davos said it himself. He couldn’t be king. They had to find a compromise to bring peace. 

I also hear, “this made everything pointless” well no... Tywin, Cersei, Littlefinger, and everyone else we hate are dead. And the good guys sit at the council, there are no white walkers, and no war. 

I wanted Arya to kill Cersei, but she saw the building collapse who wouldn’t run? The Hound stayed cause he doesn’t care. I wanted Dany to be queen and Jon as king and live happily ever after. but that wouldn’t solve Jamie locked up and Sansa not kneeling. I wanted to see the happy ending. But just because it’s not happy that makes it bad? is society so used to seeing happy endings that when the ending is not happy, people just hate it because it’s different and not what they’re used to? I thought it was fine. It made sense for the most part. I don’t understand why fans are upset, and i want to understand :)",gameofthrones
984,"I wasn’t sure how I would feel about the ending, but I’d figured I’d be happy with it, as I have with every other season, despite losing favorite characters.

From my perspective, I’m having a hard time seeing how Dany got from a place of mercy and being the “breaker of chains” to becoming delusional about the truth of who she had become. It just seemed like such a far jump from the depth and sincerity she had to the blinded-by-power tyrant she had become. 

Although I like the idea of Bran becoming an elected King, and the North remaining free, what about Jon? He is the only one who always did what was right, much like Ned Stark, yet GOT continues to send the message that doing what’s right only leads to punishment. 

I also don’t see how the Unsullied became blind killers as well — especially of innocent women and children. Someone else, loyal to Dany, and other than Jon, could have stood up to her and tried to show her that what she was doing was wrong.  Remind her of things she had said I the past, and of what her father had done.

Anyway, I guess I may be alone here, but it’s just not sitting right with me — especially Jon.",gameofthrones

From that point, she continually battled between doing good things and terrible things in Slavers Bay, Asatapor,  Yunkai and Meereen, also including the Dothraki capital. We just didn't pay much attention to the terrible things because:

A) They were terrible and cruel things done to terrible and cruel people. Who cares, right? The Dexter phenomenon.

B) They were done to red shirts, or characters we cared nothing about, had little to no attachment to or were antagonists or barriers in the way of Dany's goals. We all wanted to see her go to Westeros and take the throne. 

C) We liked Dany, faults and all. We wanted her to succeed. We paid little attention to the terrible things she was doing because of our bias for her and instead often cheered as she smiled while roasting people alive and demanding to hear their suffering and deathly screams and so on ... Hmmm, I think that says a lot about our own morality too, quite frankly.

And I think it's no coincidence that the people who generally did not like Dany, or at least not very much, seemed to have been far more accepting  of her actions in Season 8 Episode 5. Some of these people had even been calling her arc for many years in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

It's only when she comes to Westeros and begins interacting with characters and people we do care about that we start to really question her sanity and specifically by this I mean the general audience at large. 

Then consider that by this time, it's season 7, the show is literally almost over, thus giving the surface impression of a rapid arc that was not developed properly. In actuality, it had been building since season 1, but primarily season 2. 

It's really only on revisiting the series or on reflection of Dany's entire arc that we can begin to appreciate how fleshed out of a hero and villain she really is from the very beginning and as a consequence, begin to have a lot more appreciation for Season 8 Episode 5 and at least the first half of Season 8 Episode 6.",gameofthrones

However, I fear that if they do not take proactive measures, there is no way any even-slightly-provocative questions will be answered or even asked.

This is D&amp;D we’re talking about. These guys do not handle critisicim well and you can be sure they will do all they can to avoid it. As far as I know they haven’t done a single interview since they started getting shit for Season 8. When the Jaimie-Cersei rape controversy came about they refused to aknowledge the uproar until they were surprised a year later at a Q&amp;A by a female fan, and forced to give a cringeworthy awkward response that completely contradicted what others had said about the scene (they acted like they made it a rape on purpose, when the director and actors have made it clear it was an editing/filming error and the scene was supposed to be portrayed as consensual).

These guys are going to screen questions. I don’t know how Comic Con works. I don’t know if they’ve done it in the past. But they will do it this year. Trust me. So if you get screened before you ask your question, make sure you have a fake overly positive question that appeals to their ego ready to go so they’re more likely to pick you, and then when they do, give em the real thing.",gameofthrones

1001," **This is gonna be a long one so please bare with me.**

**Most people wonder why Dany burned everything on site instead of only the Redkeep. And to be fair that's probably the first thought that came to everyone's mind when she looked at the Redkeep with all that hate, most people thought the Redkeep is gone, instead she burned everything.**

**A lot of people see it as a plot hole or that it hasn't been built up to enough but I have to respectfully disagree, and here's why.**

**Dany always felt like Westeros was her home and its people are her people. But she NEVER felt at home in Westeros except for when she first landed on Dragonstone. Every experience she had since landing has not made it easier for her. Those who declared for her didn't agree with her and then fell very quickly. Even after saving Winterfel and the world she felt like she was admired the least, or at least still looked at as a stranger. But worst of all, she lost more trusted and loved advisors and friends in Westeros than she had in her entire life across the narrow sea. And that's both in the past and the present. The scene between Grey Worm and Messandei where they felt like strangers and they will never be treated as one of them, Dany might not have said it exactly - as being loved is different than being seen as a foreigner - but she's been feeling the same way for a while. Starting with Randall Tarly then Sansa Stark and then basically in every gathering that happened in Winterfel.**

**The one person left to her from Westeros was Jon and then the news about his birth tainted it and him refusing to keep it from his family and then the secret getting out ruined it furthermore. But what truly devastated her was his repeated rejection. He was the last thing left to her from all of Westeros especially with Tyrion failing her repeatedly. But even then destroying Kingslanding wasn't as probable to happen if it weren't for Messandei's murder, because to her it was the last straw that filled her heart with hate towards all of Westeros. What happened next only sealed The fate of the Kingslanders even more. With the secret out and Varys betraying her and conspiring to kill her and being told by Tyrion and then Jon rejecting her again and that's a very important point. When she tried sleeping with him again even after telling him that she doesn't feel loved in Westeros, it was as if she was saying I would settle for your love instead of theirs. But he rejected her again, and that I think was as bad to her as losing Messandei. He's the first she truly loved since Drogo and she has never experienced rejection before, which can't be disregarded not only because it's happening to a strong woman and a queen but also because it's piling on the both open and hidden rejection of all of Westeros sealing its fate.**

**Some might say that all of this was too subtle, but you forget that the show always liked a little bit of surprise in big events so it was actually the right amount of subtlety.**

**And for all of that it can be said - or that's at least my humble opinion - that if either G.R.R Martin or David Benioff and D.B. Wiess have opted for a happy ending I imagine the best one was that after a few confrontaions and situations between Dany and varios westerosy Lords followed by conversations with Tyrion, Varys, Grey Worm, Messandie and Jon snow that Dany would've accepted that she belonged with the people she freed and lived more amongst. And after she and Jon conquered Kingslanding together and putting him on the Iron Throne as Agon Targaryen starting a new historic era in which targaryens ruled all the known world on both sides of the Narrow Sea. but for that to be even slightly possible at least one of Jora Mormont or Messandie had to survive.**

**The only things that disappointed me in the final season are three small issues.**

**First: Not seeing an introduction from Jon between Dany and Ghost. I know it might seem like nothing but it was something I was actually waiting for and I don't think I was alone in this. How he would react to her? would his treatment to her give him a small clue that she's related to him? how he fares when getting close to the dragon? I get they wanted the focus in graphics on more significant events but the way I see it is when you are finishing something that big and postponed for more than a year in airing then you should go all out in everything big or small.**

**Second: we should've seen at least two or three scenes between Dany and Arya other than nothing at all. I know they are two characters that had nothing connecting them throughout the show or the series, but any conversation between those two would've been something to witness, especially if one of those was a daring confrontation after the burning of Kingslanding.**

**Third: ( and a lot more disappointing ) Dany's death scene. It was handled a little poorly. The conversation was short, Jon should have argued more that that. And I don't know why but Dany not saying anything before dying didn't sit well with me. It's the biggest death in the whole series it was the kind of death that deserved a few words exchanged before she drew her last breath.**

**But in general I sincerely do not agree with all the disappointment of many viewers of the events of the last two episodes and the last season in general.**",gameofthrones
1002,"A beloved, morally sound and reasonable character turning into a genocidal maniac was never going to work out well however much time you give it, when has that ever happened before in well received fiction or even in real life? The plan sucks as simple as that. 

Danny should have killed some major character(s) like execute Sansa(or try to) for treason and the fans would have changed sides and bought into her being an evil person. Just like everyone started hating Stannis overnight, that was pulled off far better because it was believable evil. Disappointing but believable. 

They literally made her the worst human that ever lived in Westeros, it's completely bonkers and the ratings speak for themselves. All other problems in Season 8 would have been forgiven by the fans just like they didn't penalize season 7 for some of its ludicrousness.

1013,"I am curious about this, considering people like Brienne. Yes, Brienne is from the stormlands and she was taught she was an ugly thing by her septa (and in the book she looks like a man and isn’t just tall and buff) but at the same time her father taught her swordplay as “you shouldn’t tussle with boys but I’ll be sure you’re doing it right”. Meanwhile, the north is more liberal towards women in combat: in the book all the mormont girls are warriors, with Dacey Mormont being Robb Stark’s bodyguard. And because the north is cold and unforgiving, many women are ruling over lands, like Lady Hornwood. If Brienne was born in the north, yeah she’d be made fun of for looking like a man but be applauded for being a warrior. 

This also goes hand in hand with the books since it deconstructs the tomboy doesn’t want to have tea parties and wear makeup trope: yeah it sucked for Arya to be a lady but at the same time she had three square meals and a roof over her head whereas now she’s a 9 year old girl losing her sanity, murdering people, and running for her life. She even thinks that if she had to go back to lady lessons she would take it. And as a lady the only things she was good at were math and horseback riding, which she eclipsed Sansa in. 

So sorry about that but my question is:

How would Arya’s upbringing changed if Catelyn wasn’t a Tully but rather perhaps (I’m just randomly giving house names) a Bolton or a Manderly? Would Catelyn have still been a lady, considering we have people like Lady Dustin? Would she have been more accepting of Arya but still taught her a compromise? 

I am curious because in the books, Ned doesn’t think Arya liking swords is anything more than a kiddy phase, like karate: you saw a commercial about it and three months later you’re bored. Granted, Lyanna was an athletic, beautiful tomboy who loved all kinds of martial prowesses. So would Ned become like Catelyn and try to make Arya something she isn’t? Or would he take more of an interest in Sansa who has no interest in doing stupid things like learning how to start a campfire or shoot a bow? 

Would Sansa have been the Arya Horseface in this scenario and hated living in the North a heck of a lot more and not just in a teen sense? After all, how does being good at knitting compare to knocking a boy’s teeth out? Yeah she’s a beauty but still, she’s no Arya. 

Thoughts?",gameofthrones

Epilogue

Jon opened his eyes. 

It was morning; the cold had woken him, the cold and his dreams. He hated dreaming, his dreams were always the same. He dreamt of fire, of ash, of lost love. He felt cold even though the fire was still crackling in his chimney. As he rose slowly from the bed; he felt something moving next to his bed on the cold floor. Ghost. The snowy white giant direwolf opened one of his red eyes and closed it again as he saw Jon moving from the bed to the privy.

‘It’s no use looking at me that way, Tormund is coming soon and ye better help me this time. We can’t lose to him again’ said Jon.

Ever since he had been exiled back North, to the real North, Tormund and him had an annual hunting competition. The hunt’s champion would be whoever could catch the biggest animal and bring it back to the Free Folk for a feast. The people called it: ‘the Hunt of the Dragonrider and the Giantsbane’. Tormund had won every year since Jon’s exile began seven years ago. This would be the seventh. Two years ago, Jon thought he would win, when Ghost helped him catch the biggest Stag he had ever seen. Tormund caught a grey bear twelve feet tall. Jon lost.

‘Seven years… has it been that long already? Perhaps time should be measured by events and not by years’ Jon thought… He smiled sadly as he remembered moments gone by. He thought of his sisters Sansa and Arya. He thought of Bran, the cripple boy who became King. Mostly he thought of her, he always thought of her. Daenerys.

Jon finished relieving himself, and put on his clothes and wolf-coat. He heard a knock on the door.

‘That will be the Giantsbane’ said Jon to Ghost, as he opened the door.

The giant ginger smiled at the sight of a half awoken Jon. 

‘Are ye ready to lose again little Crow?’ said Tormund.

‘This is the seventh year of the hunt. Seven is a lucky number, like the gods. Mayhaps the gods will smile on me this time’ said Jon.

‘You’re in the North, the old gods rule here my little Crow. Let’s get started Dragonrider, I am already hungry’ said Tormund smiling at his old friend.

Jon picked up his Valyrian sword, Longclaw, his bow and arrows, a leather pouch with dry meat for him and Ghost to share, and some water.  Jon waited at the door as his direwolf slowly got off the floor and came to him. Once outside Tormund smiled and wished his friend good luck.

‘I will see you at sunset Dragonrider’ said Tormund amusedly. 

‘Same to you Tormund of Tarth’ said Jon smiling back at his friend

‘Aaaahhhh good memories’ said Tormund smiling to himself as he walked away from them.

The village was deserted, everybody still asleep as the sun slowly emerged from its daily slumber. Jon and Ghost started walking west towards the nearby forest. Jon had decided to walk around the edge of the forest, on the north side, to spot any animal tracks before deciding to venture into the forest to chase whatever animal might be there. It was a beautiful day Jon thought. The sky was cloudless. Only the vanishing red light from the rising sun disturbed the blueness of the sky. If he looked south he could see the Wall in the horizon. After all these years, the sight of it still took Jon’s breath away. There she was: bright, crying as the first rays of dawn hit her glasslike surface in the summer sun. Eternal.

After an hour or so of walking, they reached the edge of the forest.

‘All right Ghost; let’s see what we can find. Use that nose of yours’ said Jon. The giant direwolf stared at Jon with its big ruby eyes before it started trotting at a slow pace while sniffing the ground in front of him for any animal scents.

Jon was walking briskly behind his direwolf, with his bow and arrow at the ready. The forest to their left looked dark and uninviting, with no signs of animal tracks. They followed the edge of the forest, but ahead of them three hundred yards away, a massive boulder blocked the path. They would either have to go south into the forest or they would have to walk around it on the north side. As they approached the massive rock, Ghost stopped.

‘What is it Ghost? Did you catch a scent?’ Jon quietly asked his wolf.

Ghost lowered its massive body, its left ear pointing backwards, the hair on its back bristled as the wolf started walking slowly towards the rock. Jon followed, bow and arrow ready. They slowly followed the circumference of the rock as they moved northwards around it and away from the forest.  

Jon was about twenty yards away from the edge of the boulder; he would be able to peak on the other side. Ghost started snarling its teeth as Jon reached the edge of the boulder with his bow ready.

‘I’ll shoot it and you hold it down. Then I’ll come running behind you to end it with Longclaw” he whispered to his direwolf.

Jon quickly moved to the other side of the boulder ready to strike…and he froze.

There in front of him, on the other side of the boulder at the edge of the forest resting on the ground was something he hadn’t seen in seven years, and something he thought he would never see again in his life.

A Dragon.

The beast rested on the ground, its black scales as dark as night, massive in its length. It’s long neck bent over its right wing, as if distracted by something on the other side. From where he stood Jon could only see the Dragon’s left profile. Its left wing was half raised, while its long tail rested on the ground by the trees.

Jon could not see the dragon’s face, but he knew who it was. Here at the end of the world, rested the dragon that burnt the Gold Road, the one who brought fire to the Long Night, the dragon that fought its brother in the clouds above Winterfell, the one that had rescued Jon beyond the Wall, the bane of Kings Landing, the one who melted the Iron Throne; and took its dead Mother away in the darkness across the Narrow Sea. The only living dragon left in the world.

Drogon.

Jon stood there watching the magnificent beast, as Ghost remained slightly behind him by the boulder. He lowered his bow and arrow, as he took half a step towards Drogon. His black leather boot was loud in the flat rocky path, and the dragon turned its massive neck around until he found the source of the noise. Jon. 

Drogon stared at Jon, with its mouth and nostrils slightly opened. The dragon’s head was no more than fifty yards away.

Jon stared back at the dragon silently, unsure of what to do. From the corner of his eye, he thought he saw something moving behind the dragon’s left wing. He slowly turned his gaze from the dragon’s eyes to its wing. There, stepping from behind the wing appeared a vision of his past, the reason his heart felt empty and his guilt never-ending. 

Daenerys Targaryen.

Jon’s bow and arrow made a loud noise on the rock as they fell from his hand. He stood there stony and silent, as the statues of the old Kings of Winter in the crypts of Winterfell. He thought it must be a dream, a cruel one. 

‘Dany?’ he muttered silently.

Daenerys smiled softly as she pet Drogon’s wing and started walking towards Jon. She looked as radiant as ever, as if time had stopped by. Her long silver blonde hair moved freely down to her waist. She had a small braid dangling from her forehead to her neck. Her indigo eyes shone as bright as the ice of the Wall in the morning sun. She wore the same white and grey sheep coat that she used to wear when visiting the North.

She stopped three steps away from Jon, as she stared at him with soft eyes and smiled sadly at him. Jon felt those three steps were a greater chasm than crossing the Narrow Sea. He felt his knees buckle under the weight of his aching heart.

‘Da..Dany…how? Jon asked sheepishly

‘The Lord of Light’, she said simply. ‘Drogon took me East. The followers of R’Hllor brought me back, just like you. Now we both have scars in our hearts’.

‘Dany…I’m sorry…I…’ Jon said. He could not say anything else. The words escaped him as they left his mouth. Jon’s eyes reflected the pain and sorrow in his heart, as the tears started forming and gently streaming down his face.

Daenerys took the final steps between them and stood there looking at his old lover’s eyes, as she softly touched his face and wiped the tears away. Jon saw that she was smiling at him as her own tears streamed down her fair cheeks. For the first time in seven years he felt hope, the hope that only love can bring to a man’s heart. 

Jon gently grabbed her hands and stared into her eyes, terrified that this moment would disappear and he would only have a vague memory of it. Terrified it would disappear, like a dream that is forgotten when the body is suddenly awoken.

‘Where have you been all this time?’ Jon said softly.

‘Volantis. That is where I was given the kiss of life. I stayed there for some time, and then went back to the Great Grass Sea’ said Daenerys.

‘Dany…I’m sorry’ said Jon. He wanted to say so much more to her, but the words betrayed him.

‘I know you are. I had many enemies in my first life, but I did not think I would die at the hands of the noblest man I knew. The man I loved’ she said with some pain in her voice.

‘At first, I wanted to come back with Fire and Blood once again. However, having life again changed me…with time, I understood your choice’ she said.

‘I should have tried to convince you some other way…I…’ Jon said. 

Daenerys gently squeezed his hands. ‘You were right, and so was Varys. I lost my way on my path to the Iron Throne. I became what I always struggled to keep at bay. I became my father’s daughter’ Daenerys said regretfully.

‘Life was given back to me, and I had…other things to mind…so I went back to the Dothraki Sea, away from the world’ she said with a smile on her face.

Even with his eyes full of tears as he stared at Daenerys, Jon caught a slight movement from the corner of his eyes. He saw as Drogon’s gargantuan head turned around to its right, as something appeared from behind its right wing. It was the most beautiful sight that Jon had ever seen in his life. 

A little girl.

The little girl could not have been older than six years old, Jon thought. She started walking slowly towards Daenerys and Jon. She had fair skin and her eyes were a brighter shade of indigo than Daenerys. She had two silver hair braids on each side of her face down to her neck. ‘Targaryen hair’ Jon thought. 

As she approached them, he noticed that her hair in the middle was not silver, but black and wavy. His heart started racing, as if it was trying to tell him something about this most beautiful of creatures.

The little girl wore a sheep coat, half black and half red with a grey silver band across the middle. This is what Jon thought Daenerys must have looked like when she was that age, except for the patch of black hair. Jon had no doubt this girl was Daenerys Targaryen’s daughter. He noticed that she was holding a wooden figurine, a toy of some sort. It was a wooden dragon, painted sky blue except for its dark green tail. She stopped about five yards from them.

Daenerys let go of Jon’s hands and approached her daughter. She grabbed her hand and brought her closer to Jon, no more than one foot away.

‘This is your father my love. He was a King, and his name is Aegon Targaryen, the sixth of his name” Daenerys said looking at his daughter.

Daenerys looked happily at Jon and said: ‘this is your daughter. Her name is Lyanna Targaryen’

Jon’s legs gave out and he fell on his knees in front of his daughter. Ghost approached Jon as it saw him falling on his knees.

Jon looked at Lyanna with all the love a man can have for his child, and with all the pain that his heart had carried for seven long years.

‘How?...Dany, how?... Jon’s words were barely audible.

‘Only death can pay for life. My life allowed her to live’ Daenerys said sweetly as a tear slowly fell down her face.

Jon hugged and kissed his daughter with tears in his eyes and joy in his heart. He held her with more love than he had ever given to anyone, more than Arya, more than Daenerys, more than Ghost. He did not know how long that moment lasted, in that instant he felt immortal. 

At last he let go of Lyanna.

‘Lyanna… that’s a beautiful name’ said Jon smiling at his daughter.

‘Mother named me after my grandmother. She said she had great beauty and was very brave’ the girl said with conviction.

‘She was just like you’ said Jon approvingly

Ghost got closer to the little girl, who seemed a bit scared of the giant direwolf. Ghost then smelled the patch of black hair and started licking her ear. Lyanna giggled as she started petting the wolf’s only ear.

‘What’s his name?’ Lyanna asked curiously

‘His name is Ghost. I’ve had him since he was a pup. I think he likes you’ Jon said. Jon gently grabbed Lyanna’s wooden dragon and started examining it.

‘I like your toy dragon, does he have a name?’ he asked 

‘He protects the smaller dragons, so I named him Jorax after Mother’s bravest Knight’ said Lyanna as Daenerys smiled at her daughter and Jon.

A sad smile crossed Jon’s mouth, as he remembered House Mormont. ‘Your mother is right, he was brave, gallant and honorable. What every Knight should be. He saved our lives’ Jon said.

Jon then pulled some of the dry meat from his leather pouch and offered it to Lyanna so she could feed Ghost.

Lyanna started feeding Ghost and playfully petting the direwolf. Drogon sneered and turned its head away from the little girl and her new friend.

Jon stood once again and saw that Daenerys was beaming at him. The dawn had given way to the sun, the sky was blue and cloudless, and the Wall shined as bright as ever in the horizon. Jon thought this was the most perfect moment of his life. He grabbed Dany’s face and kissed her. He did not know how long he kissed her.

‘Mother, father, they’ve found us. They did follow us’ said Lyanna with excitement.

Jon’s soldier instincts made him turn around quickly looking for an enemy. It was then when Drogon got up from his rest, raised his head to the sky and roared louder than Jon had ever heard or remembered.

Jon’s hand went for Longclaw as he scanned the surrounding area. Before he could unsheathe his sword, Daenerys hand calmly grabbed him by the wrist. She quietly pointed up, to the morning sky.

Jon raised his head and saw what Lyanna had seen. Approaching the clearing were they stood, Jon saw one more magnificent sight in this most humbling of days.

Dragons.

He counted six dragons led by a sky blue one with a dark green tail. They were all of various sizes, all smaller than Drogon. The dragons started landing in the clearing next to Drogon.

‘They made it mother, they’re here’ said Lyanna with the innocence and wonder than only a child has.

Daenerys smiled at her daughter and looking at Jon said ‘they are here, just like us. Home’

Everything goes the same (except Rhegal is not inexplicably sniped from impossible angles out of the blue) until the battle at King’s Landing. The battle begins much the same way, except to make it feel a bit more tense and not one sided this is when Rhegal gets taken down. 

While Danny takes out the ballistas Jamie manages to make his way into the keep with Cersei. Prior to this she was seen whispering with Qyburn about some plan. After Jamie arrives they cut back to the battle. 

Danny’s army storms the city and easily defeats Cersei’s forces. However, this time instead of inexplicably leveling the whole city when the bells ring Dany flies over to the keep to kill Cersei herself. At the same time Arya and the hound arrive at the keep to find the Mountain guarding the door to Cersei’s chamber. The Hound battles him allowing Arya to get past. She walks in just as Danny arrives. They give each other a quick “what are you doing here?!” glance before turning their attention to Cersei who is sitting with her back to them. As Danny begins ranting Cersei remains silent with her back to them. Arya gets the feeling something is off and quickly rushes over to Cersei and turns her around. Both Arya and Danny a frozen in shock when they realize the women is not Cersei, but the Shame Nun, who Cersei had practically turned into her own personal Reek. As the realization of what had just happened sets in a rumbling is heard getting louder, and louder until it erupts into a bang as green flames engulf the entire city. 

The camera cuts to Cersei and a horrified Jamie on a boat making their way out to sea. Jamie, horrified at what he had just seen draws his sword and appears to be about to kill Cersei, but can’t bring himself to do it. 

The camera cuts back to an injured Dany kneeling in the rubble next to whatever is left of the iron throne.

Most of us loved ""Jenny of Oldstones,"" whether the Pod version or the F+TM version.

Obviously, things didn't go that direction.

My question is: was the song's melody only used twice: the first time when Pod sang it, and then during the credits with Florence singing it?

I ask because it seems like, regardless of my own interpretation of it being wrong, it still should hold some king of significance/meaning for the story and--if it does--it might resurface again. But on all my listens of the soundtrack and rewatches, I don't recall ever hearing it again. I thought I had it in the throne room scene in episode six, but alas--I think it might've just been ""Truth."" This seems like a missed opportunity if they dropped it after episode two.

1028,"Hello Samwell, the last of the Tarly’s,  
Acolyte of Citedial.

I read you’re latest volumes, in the series of Ice and Fire. It was interesting. It’s amusing to see history distorting itself. No one means to lie... but the truth is never what gets told.

I felt compelled to write this. Just one record of the truth. Partially for my sanity, and partially to see if anyone ever finds it. Ever reads it. Ever believes.

While your volume seven and eight and rife with inaccuracies, I wish to focus on one for now; he one you call the Mad Queen. The beautiful Daenerys Targaryen.

Was she mad?  
It may be justifiable to call her that.  
But she wasn’t rash. Or impulsive. Or cruel.  
Not by intention. Although some may justifiably perceive that way.  

She simply saw a horrible truth, and did what she thought was right. But let’s start at the beginning.

...

Daenerys was a young girl. And knew little of ways of war. But no one knew when it came to Obsidian.

It’s almost like it’s named to be insidious.

Dragon glass was how she knew it. And what could be frightening about dragon glass to the Dragon Queen? All she could notice was beautiful it was. The way it grabbed the light. The way that if you stared at it long enough, it seemed to melting.

“Glass can’t move” she mused to herself, as she sat within her cave, deep below earth. She was home, finally. And she powerful, finally. And she was ready to do what she needed to do, finally. What was there to fear? Really.

And so that dainty young girl ran delicate fingers across the glass; just to feel that it solid.

She was annoyed when she pricked herself. When a shard of glass found her way between her nail and skin. A thin piece had lodged itself deep inside her.

It didn’t bleed, but it hurt. It was an irritating pain. Pulsing. She tried to forget it, she tried to get on with duties, but the pain that wouldn’t go away.

I’m sure you are familiar with Greyscale. The stone illness that slowly consumes a man, and turns him into little more than an animated rock. Well dragon glass has a similar effect, it turns you into the animated, walking, sometimes even living dead. You stop growing, you stop consuming resources, and eventually you start to die.

It’s a rare illness. But even rarer is the blood of the dragon. Fire made flesh can fight the cold grasp of death. And that’s what happened. The illness ravaged her, but couldn't consume her fully. She stopped growing, but never decayed. She died, but still lived. And something the living will never know, is how much things change when you’re dead.

Her perspective grew, and the world around her shrank.
Time began to dilate; she could watch a single snowflake drop for hours.
And she began to hear the spirits.
The voices of the dead. All of the dead. Including the self-crowned king of the dead, known only now as the The Night King.

He whispered to her. He gently guided her to cruel unyielding truths. Everything she ever worked for was in vain. Every dream, was a pipe dream. The truth started soft but grew. It rang in her mind like deafened bell, reverberating off her skull, being driven by the glass in her finger.

Everyone was a slave.  
Everyone would always be a slave.  
Your life was decided by when and where you were born,  
More than decision you could ever make,  
And nothing,  
Nothing she could do would change that.  

She listened.  
To the land.  
To people.  
She felt all the suffering of the living.  
The hunger, the grief.  
Everyone was trapped.  

At least while they were living.

...

And you see dear Sam, this is why The Queen of Ice and Fire did what she did. She wished to free people, to truly free them. And it worked. They still hail her the breaker of chains. Families live in peace and freedom.

I don’t expect you to understand Sam. You are of the living, you could never quite grasp it. But please keep this letter. It’s important the living world at least have one true recollection of her. Even if it’s not read for a thousand thousand years.

Body of the Bran the Eternal",gameofthrones
1029,"I really liked Daenerys at first, justifying her acts of cruelty as anger issues and turning a blind eye to her ""the end justifies the means"" mentality. To make an omelet you need to break a few eggs. But I could no longer do it when she continued burning down Kings Landing. I could not understand how the character I had loved could be capable of sustained cruelty. Momentary cruelty yes, but this was too much, I thought. But then I tried to really understand the character and put myself on her dragons, so to speak. Here is my best try:

The shame of her being the daughter of a madman and being exiled away from her home is too painful for her to feel. She, understandably, could not accept the shame that she was inherently broken. This makes her vulnerable to creating an ideal false self: a queen destined to free the people and stop the wheel of power that crushes all the poor people underneath as it rolls. She has a grand, noble purpose and the god-like power of destiny on her side. She believed that false self so much so that she walked into a fire. Who does that? She was lucky, but she only found out because she's goddamn mental. Can you imagine Jon Sno walking into a fire? He'd be peeing himself. And then Daenerys decides to ride a dragon. Again, who does that? Hasn't she heard you can raise a wolf puppy but when they grow up they gonna maul you? What do you think it's like for fucking dragons? She's always been mental, but she has also always been lucky. She reminds the people of her greatness and virtue, but she's really reminding Herself. She is a Targaryen after all, and that comes with connotations of insanity. That shame needs to be pushed down whenever it flares up.

Betrayal makes that shame flare up because why would anyone betray the breaker of chains, the legendary mother of dragons destined to sit on the iron throne? Only if they don't believe her story, which means they must have a reason for not believing her story, which means she starts to doubt herself too. If others don't believe her story, should she? That brings her back to that unbearable feeling that she is inherently broken. The shame must be pushed back down. The false self becomes her identity, and she must protect that persona because only empty despair and pain lay on the other side. Who is she if she is not the mother of dragons sitting upon the iron throne? When we invest ourselves in a false self, we do so at the expense of developing our true selves. When the false self finally crumbles, only an empty scaffolding remains.

Daenerys fell when the 3-eyed raven spilled the beans about Jon Sno being a Targaryen, which we assume is true. This was the moment Tyrion Lannister and Varys realize there is another option for the throne. Up to now, there was only one option, so why waste time scrutinizing it? But now they must compare, and that saying about the mental state of a Targerian being a coin toss at birth comes into play. Being betrayed by Varys means he saw through her false self and into the inherently broken Daenerys she is so desperately scared of feeling. If he saw through her, she might also catch a painful glimpse. It's hard to deny a truth everyone around you accepts. She had to prevent that, so she displaces her shame onto Varys. Varys now personifies her true self and he must disappear never to be seen again, not even his corpse. But others had seen Varys, especially Tyrion. Despite giving Tyrion his last chance, she no longer trusts him, but she denies that she has once again been betrayed; Tyrion has probably just lost his edge. However, by freeing his brother, Tyrion gives the mercy that Daenerys couldn't. That means she is the callous one in comparison. It also means he fears her because he did not try to convince her to free him. That is too close to what people thought of Daenerys' father. What is a mad king if not a callous person people fear? Tyrion has also seen through Daenerys' false self, but he cannot accept this because it goes against his own pride of being intelligent. It also means more war. He denies this until it becomes too hard to deny. Daenerys and Tyrion no longer trust each other, but neither can accept that truth.

Tyrion told her the city bells will ring when it surrenders. Daenerys now has a choice: believe Tyrion, which means Tyrion was right to free his brother and fear her as a callous woman; or label Tyrion a betrayer, in which case this means the bell-ringing is a ruse and she must attack, justifying such an atrocity by claiming Cersei used her people as a shield. Believing Tyrion means feeling once more that unbearable pain that she is defective, a pain she all too recently felt due to Varys' betrayal. Not believing Tyrion means accepting he betrayed her, which then also brings those unbearable feelings. She had to make a choice when bells tolled for her, but there was no way out; that unbearable shame was coming and she had to defend herself from herself. She chose to mistrust Tyrion so the resulting anger and hatred could keep her false self together. Think about it, anger is often one of the first stages of grief people go through because it helps us keep it together as some sort of psychic glue when the truth is too hard to bear. We can't break down into desperation when we are angry and full of hatred. Daenerys wants to break the wheel once and for all and justifies her wrath to herself by claiming Cersei used her people as a shield. She believes that end justifies the means of burning the city to the ground and the anger and hatred launch her to action. But when she starts and hears the children screaming and fleeing it's harder to deny that she is mad. The shame keeps pushing through stronger and stronger, the cracks in her false self keep spreading and she gets angrier and more full of hatred to keep her false self together. She is not thinking about the people because she is too focused on the battle going on inside her head. 

Eventually, there is nobody left to kill and nothing left to destroy. The vicious circle stops and she can calm down. She cannot look at the damage she has caused because that is like looking into her true self. It is too painful and there is nothing left to hate and be angry at. But at least it's in the past; now the true reign of peace can start. War is war, she used them as a shield, they left me no choice, it had to be done, etc. She chooses to narrowly focus on the symbol of her false self: the iron throne. So narrowly that she seems to not notice the destroyed building where it stands.

Jon Sno was the only person to truly love her without idolizing her. When Jon Sno kills her, she suddenly realizes who she thought believed her false self enough to love her now sees her true self clearly. When he stabs her, her false self crumbles. She may be able to trick herself into believing that her mind is not broken, but she can't deny a body broken by a dagger. What is left behind is the scaffolding of her true self. Her expression as she dies is one of empty desperation, a person who died without ever truly living. Jon Sno sees this emptiness. He is not sure if he did the right thing because he only met the true Daenerys once the dagger went in, and all he saw was that empty fragile scaffolding. So little was there that it was hard to tell when she was gone, almost needing the blood coming out of her mouth and nose to confirm she was no longer there. She became a stranger.

Drogon sees her mother dead, but he is no closer to meeting her real self than when she was alive. Now there is no hope of ever doing so. It was not Jon Sno who killed her, it was the delusion of grandeur; the idealized false self Daenerys desperately created to escape the pain of feeling she was inherently broken. The throne had to go not because the dragon was somehow wise about the history of men fighting senseless wars for momentary power upon that throne, but because it represented Daenerys' false self, with her true self symbolized by her broken body. Or maybe the dragon was like ""If she can't have it, nobody can"". I can't really get into the mind of a dragon to be totally honest.

Daenerys never sat on the iron throne because deep inside she knew she was not who she said she was. Not really. She touched the symbol of what she thought she was, but she could not get in touch with what she really was: broken.",gameofthrones
1030,"Note: Right after I posted this I noticed some errors, and after I edited them I did something that uncovered the spoilers bars.  I changed it back within seconds, but if anyone somehow saw anything they shouldn’t have (I think that’s why I have the bot comment) then I sincerely apologize. 


1. Question: &gt;!Who’s the warden of the Westerlands now?? We’ve got Bronne in the Reach (which I have mixed feelings about but good enough), the most wholesome Baratheon in history at Storms End, the lovable idiot brother of Cat in the Riverlands, #1 sister Yara in the Iron islands, a random back-up Martell cousin in Dorne, the spoiled kid in the vale (surprised the show never wrote its way to a replacement), the Queen in the North (Hell yeah), and Bran in King’s landing...so is anyone doing anything anymore in the Westerlands or are all the minor lords still celebrating the end of the Lannisters?  I like to think they gave it to Tyrion, and he just kept the Lannister name and symbol but just turned the image around for the better.  He could definitely father children, and I honestly think it would be cool to have a house in the future known for such a large number of them being dwarves (and yes, children of parents with achondroplasia have close to a 50/50 chance,1/4 if one parent, of being born with it as well), showing their lineage to such an awesome guy and the  savior to their house.  Also as a great generations-lasting middle finger to Tywin and Cersei.  Either that or I considered Podrick with house Payne but he seems happy enough in the kingsguard.!&lt;

2.  Comment:  &gt;!Despite so many people being disappointed with the ending (and I have my issues with it) I”m overall pretty happy with it.  Mainly the lord-elected system for king.  I like the house lines lasting within the lordships, but I also think it’s a good idea to have a central government keeping among the different kingdoms (except for the north, the Starks are cool) but one that doesn’t inherit it, so there won’t be any disputes over birth right.  I’m obviously not vouching for that kind of monarchical/aristocratic/etc in real life *beats chest in American* but it works for that world, or at least at that worlds place in time...also house sigils and thrones are really cool (that’s what kept drawing me back to this show in the first place).  And yes...Bran has zero personality left which makes him hard to follow him as a character anymore, but kind of like what Tyrion said, that’s kind of a good thing, also someone who knows all of the 100% truthful history and bits of the present?? Sounds like quite the problem solver.  Also he’s a Stark, and, like I said, Starks are pretty awesome.  I will say I am disappointed with Jon’s (I’m not calling him Aegon...) ending, it is a little touching and poetic for him to be back at the wall...but I just feel like he belongs doing so much more.  I love that Sansa is Queen in the North, but maybe Bran could change the law and Jon could be like a part-time/on and off nights watch guy? Maybe do some traveling with Arya? I also love that they have her sailing west, and I hope there’s some future content maybe about whatever she finds (we all know she has to find something...) and like an update on Westeros as well (don’t shoot, I haven’t read the books, and I’m sure they’re great but I don’t really plan to).!&lt;

3.  Minor/not very plot-important Question: &gt;!Where the hell is Meera Reed? She just kind of dipped after dropping Bran off at Winterfell.  She’d probably die (not enough main character plot armor) and I’m glad she didn’t, but I’m surprised she and her father’s house didn’t (well maybe some did that weren’t shown) help defend Winterfell against the white walkers.!&lt;

4. Another minor question: &gt;!What are they going to do with Dragonstone?  It would kind of such to let such an awesome castle go to waste.  To be honest with King’s Landing so heavily destroyed I thought that would be come the new seat of power.  I guess they could just give it to some trusted lord in the crownlands, I just can’t think of anyone.!&lt;

5. MAJOR/very important Comment: &gt;!Hot pie should have been made head chef/cook of the red keep, or given a minor lordship, or a little gold... something!  He was an ass in the beginning but then ended up being an awesome guy who makes large, medieval-versioned animal crackers for his friends when he sees them off.  And he played a huge role in”Winterhell’s” fate, he told Arya that Jon defeated the Boltons...without that she might’ve never made it up there in time for the Great War...and who would’ve been there to kill the damn night king?!  The realms of men might just owe Hot Pie as much as they do Arya, or I maybe someone else would’ve told her soon after, but still, he was a loyal friend with valuable culinary skills.  Not a lot of those around in Westeros.!&lt;

Alright I thought I was going to have more questions but I answered most of them myself in the meantime.  And most of this is just for discussion and hearing other fan theories, I’m sure most of it is just unwritten so there are no answers for it.  But the &gt;!Westerlands!&lt; thing is really killing me, once I latch onto a story I get kind of finicky.",gameofthrones
1031,"Hi guys,

I just finished the show and i'm currently reading a song of ice and fire to fill up my summer. I'm interested in reading a book from GRRM that acts kinda like a 'prequel' to the song of ice and fire, is there any?",gameofthrones
1032,"Which “Game of Thrones” character is the most relatable to your life story, and demeanor?

&amp;#x200B;

I think GRRM is a great writer since he wrote such true, and complex characters that resonate with people. I’d love to know how it applies to you as a person since I feel that GRRM was really writing about our ‘modern society’ but just based it in fantasy and medieval times.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, I used to think I was “John Snow” and “Jamie Lannister” but as I learned and read more… I was really “Jamie Lannister”(with some “Jon Snow” thrown in there). I was a guy that was shunned early in life (5-7th grade) since I moved to a real trash, white trash, racist, evil school, and I became friends with “Whoever would have me” and I ended up with degenerates, or was considered a ‘bad kid’ due to the crowd I ran with. This went on  into middle school, even though everyone hated my group of friends (Stoners, bad kids, degenerates, etc..) I didn’t care since they were “loyal” to me (or so I thought). So I got a bad ‘reputation’ when I didn’t even do drugs, I just rolled with them.

&amp;#x200B;

Then high school, I became a popular guy, talented at sports, etc… but people would claim or see me as a ‘good guy’ but, I was always seen as ‘scum” for being friends with those people from before. I’ve had people throughout my life give tales of me, my ways, my ‘honor’ etc… and those that knew me would be shocked since they saw how “noble” and good I was (sort of like Jamie Lannister). Though I did something wrong, I always tried to do what was “right” while keeping my loyalties. As I grew older into college and beyond, I’ve dealt with that. People talking bad of me, thinking I was arrogant or cocky (Some of that was in there), but I ultimately good, so when things did go awry, people would and have stood up for me and my character like Brienne and Tyrion did for Jamie. So I relate to him the most.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m a bit Jon Snow, but mainly the part about “Getting along” with everyone. I can befriend anyone. Regardless of race, religion, creed, country… I make it a point to be friendly, and help if I can, and keep my word. That’s how I'd like them.

&amp;#x200B;

So which characters do you think you are? Which characters encompass your personality or do you see yourself as, and why? ( I think it’s just an interesting and fun question, and I’d love to know. As my friends and I always have these fun talks about this when it comes to this story.)",gameofthrones

Hi everyone,

I need to rant a bit! All names and some details changed for anonymity's sake.

**Previously;**

I previously posted here about my relationship with my aunt Dana - short version: I found out that my gf Dana is my aunt and I am actually the owner of the company Dana has been wanting her whole life. My sisters Samantha and Anna have been bitching against Dana from the start (Samantha even wanted to not feed Dana's pets) and my brother Bo is always stoned and thinks that he is a raven. I signed over my claim to parts of the company to Dana and then everyone was pissed and on top of that we had to deal with the creditors (strange ones, blue-eyes, white skins, seems to multiply almost like zombies).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/be0781/spoilers\_need\_relationship\_advice\_everyone\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/be0781/spoilers_need_relationship_advice_everyone_is/)

**Update on the situation:**

So, the creditors arrived and attacked the firewalls of our company. We were not the best tacticians, I have to admit, we basically sent out the entire cavalry to get killed. I am not really sure what the plan was or who even came up with said plan. Someone screwed up. Wasn't me, and I don't think that it was James or Tyrs - they are all good tacticians and have seen battle, like I have. Someone screwed up, but I am really not sure who. Only that it wasn't me, cos that plan was stupid.

Anyways, we defeated our main creditor by luring him to Bo, who was sitting around, stoned as always \*yes, that part did not make sense to me as well, I just rolled with it, as did everyone else, but for some reason our main creditor wanted my stoned brother\* and then Anna worked out some anger management issues and subverted the expectation everyone had that either Dana or I would take down our biggest creditor. Yay. It really felt anticlimatic. It felt like Dana and I had been built up to be that next big thing, but then squirrel-Anna could take our main creditor down. Yay. I mean, I even had a stare-down duel with him once and Dana had some beautiful exotic pets who could breathe fire and everyone was like really, really exited ... anyway...

Anticlimatic, right? Anyway, we still had to deal with the competitor sitting at the helm of Dana's father's old company. Let's call her Cerna. So, we had James and Tyrs, her brothers, although they have not been really helpful. James apparently has been fucking her, but he has also been fucking my sister's bodyguard Brienna, so who really knows these days and Tyrs is still dealing from a head wound and insists that ""she is not a monster, she is a mother."" All evidence to the contrary. Tyrs is not as smart as he once was. Apparently he suffers from ""adaption problem"", whatever that means.

BTW, I am not shaming Tyrs! I also had some health problems - I suffered from a speech impediment and could only say ""my Queen"" and ""I don't want it."" with hilarious results. Not.

Anyways, Dana was pissed that I could challenge her claim to being CO, and Tyrs and Vars and Samantha and Bo and ... everyone actually, were really not helping. Samantha was antagonizing her, but that's her default modus now. Vars and Tyrs kept insisting that ""I would be a good CO of the company"".... and then Dana found out and had her pet barbecue Vars. Don't blame her! She was already going through a lot at that time: the second of her three pets had been shot down by our competitor (the pet had eye vision problems and could not see a very large fleet below him, I always told them that they should take him to the optician!), her best friend had been killed by Cerna, and Vars speaking against her after she had been listening to everything he said - well - I mean - I don't know. I still had speech impediment problems then, and she was ""maaah queeen."" I hope that you understand.

Ok, then, finally the big battle. Dana easily defeats everyone with her remaining last pet, which kinda had me wondering why she did not do this in the beginning ... anyways, she then started killing everyone, because she heard bells? (don't ask me, I am still not quite sure what happened) and Cerna and James died together as they kissed each other under the only part in the cellar of the castle that was destroyed. I mean, I know that james has not the brightest, but really if they had just moved two feet ---Then Dana was the CO of the Company and I killed her. I mean, I had to - it was in the script! And her pet melted the symbol of our company and then took off with her. I am actually not entirely sure what happened, I am still behind on the plot development. I only hope that no one is disappointed. I can't emphasize this enough.

After Dana's death, there was a discussion who would take over the company. Nobody thought of me , even though I had the best claim, and Grewm, one of Dana's managers, was raising a fuss about me having murdered her. He still commands an army (kinda strange, the number of men in that army kept fluctuating, but we all thought it best just to roll with it and not make a fuss, because it seemed awfully convenient).

Then, Samantha and Bo arrived; a council was convened and all said that Bo had the best story line and that he should be CO of the company. Everyone agreed, I was sentenced to Exile (What The Fuck?) in the non-company lands (North) to appease Grewm. My sister Samantha declared that she would have one part of the company and become independent. (Later, some other managers from The Maritime and Desert Section asked me if that had been an option,cos if so, they would like to change their votes and also become independent. At this point, I must admit I was pretty pissed and told them to f\*ck off and took the first ship out. I saw Grewm leaving on another ship, so I am not even sure what the exile thing was about .... The entire thing is fucked up and Bo can deal with it.)

**Now:**

When I came to the North, the first thing that happened was that my pet Ghost, my good old doggo, bit me, when he saw me, and my old friend Torsten - upon learning that James had died - relocated back to HQ and Bo, muttering something about ""fat chance"" and ""try my luck"". No idea why. But he seemed in an awful hurry and was whistling the entire time.

**Finally:**

I am not sure why I post here, but I would just like to get it of my chest - the company is now in the hands of my stoned brother Bo, Ghost is ignoring me (seemed to be pissed at me), my sister is apparently on a one-woman rampage in her own company, everybody seems to have won and I have frost bite on my butt.

I think I just need a hug - it just feels like my entire life has been building towards some glorious goal (hell, I was even raised from the dead) and now I am sitting here alone with only a pissed off pet to keep me company.

1037,"I've had a hard time understanding all the posts crushing GOT for season 7 and particularly 8.  I binge watched GOT after the last season ended and I didn't hate the ending at all.   

Maybe the difference is that I didn't have to wait 9 years for the finish.  Or maybe it's because I didn't read the books and many who did had real problems.  

Bran - good choice for king; he's literally seen it all and will be a benevolent monarch; he is the exact opposite of Jofffrey or King Robert plus there is now a Stark running the north in Winterfell, the 6 kingdoms and beyond the wall. Looks like they are set up for Stark-peace for a long while.

Dany - nothing about her turn to the dark side was surprising; many times throughout the series her first impulse was to burn it all down. In the end when she was alone she was true to her nature.  She flew too close to the sun and got burned - ironic. 

Jon Snow - coin flipped opposite of Dany.  He consistently did the right thing in his eyes including shiving Dany. Retiring beyond the wall was a good ending for him and what he deserved. 

Tyrion - he faded out as the seasons went by; probably most disappointed in his character arc over time.  He lost his joi de vivre and got boring - too many lectures. 

Davos - was actually surprised he made it to the end; to me was the most likable character and I was glad to see he survived. 

Arya - I liked that she developed a will to live past just revenge killing. It was a surprise ending for her and welcome.",gameofthrones

1050,"The scenario:

Suddenly the Night King appears in a random location of your choosing on modern day Earth, he has his dragon but whether or not he has his White Walkers or wights or spiders is up to you. This scenario theorises how the Night King would fair in the real world, would he succeed and wipe us out, or would he be completely annihilated?

&amp;#x200B;

Let's set some rules for this fight.

1. Game of Thrones and A Song of Ice And Fire do not exist in this timeline, and nothing is written to replace it, the world would be entirely unprepared for the concept of the Night King and White Walkers with the only undead in media being generic zombies.
2. Other than that one difference this timeline is **exactly** the same as this timeline, there are no real life fairy tales or mythological creatures or magic.
3. The Night King appears suddenly out of no where, he has no myths or legends about him, he simply appears overnight in a random location of your choosing with the goal of the extinction of humanity.
4. The Night King and Wights have the same abilities and stats as they do in the show and books, it doesn't matter if that power or stat is impossible or unlikely in the real world, they still have it.
5. The Night King still has a zombie dragon, however whether or not he still has his entire army of the dead is up to you.
6. The Night King can still only be killed by obsidian or Valyrian steel, no exceptions.
7. Season 8 will mostly be ignored for this scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we've got the rules set let's first look at what the Night King has going for him;

* A couple of more thousand years worth of dead bodies.
* Wights with guns.
* Wights don't die from bullets as easily as humans do.
* A modern day military would be stricken with confidence that shooting something would work, and considering he would be in the real world this means the militaries of the world would be ignorant of and even at first at least scoff at the idea of the Night King being a supernatural non-natural threat... what's a good word for a threat that is fictional but then is suddenly not fictional?
* The Night King would be unhindered by CGI budgets, he would have a properly sized army that would indeed have animals in it, whether or not he has the giant spiders however is another thing up to you.
* Regular bullets, just like swords, simply shatter on contact with a White Walker.
* As said in rules the rules about Valyrian steel, dragon glass and fire still apply, however as Valyrian steel is a completely fictitious metal humanity in this scenario doesn't have access to it, and obsidian is a material that is not only surprisingly fragile in real life, but also isn't really a material one would think would do anything against the army of the dead, as such it is highly unlikely it would be utilised by the military, and of course fire doesn't affect the actual White Walkers.
* While the Night King cannot turn machinery into wights, as the wights have been seen using weapons and even chains to pull up a dead dragon from a frozen lake it is not hard to assume the wights could hijack these vehicles and use them.
* The armies, politicians and governments of today are fickle, cowardly and petty, and even though it is without question that many would join to fight the army of the dead, it is also likely we'd have multiple Cersei's.

&amp;#x200B;

But here's the things we have going for us, and is going against him;

* While the militaries of the world would indeed be unprepared and perhaps too confident and cocky at the start it is still the highly adaptive, resourceful, strategic and powerful military of today, the militaries will not have an intelligence decrease in this scenario.
* We have better technology and therefore better and more plentiful resources, we have huge maze like cities and better higher more sturdy walls.
* The Westeros armies only had men on horsebacks and a pair of dragons, we have armadas of bomber planes, ballistic missiles, tanks and other armoured vehicles to bulldozer over wights, flamethrowers, napalm, and of course potential experimental weaponry we'd develop in reaction to the armies of the dead, while we may not have dragons, we have something arguably even more powerful.
* The Night King also cannot kill and resurrect machinery, but if like said above he hijacks it, we could still potentially make use of self-destruction to stop that happening.
* And like said previously it isn't impossible that the Night King would try to hijack our war vehicles, but whether or not the Night King would be able to multitask controlling a large amount of wights using technology far more complicated than a horse is up for debate, there's also the question of if the Night King could even figure out how to drive these very complicated vehicles that take years of training to drive.
* Every single army in the world can join in on this, whereas in GoT only a handful of Westeros armies with two of Daenarys' armies were able to join the fight.
* We can mass burn our dead.
* No matter where the Night King is, if all the armies of the world come together to stop this apocalyptic threat he would be flanked and rammed up the ass by different armies.

1055,"Sorry if that passage was already given, but I stumbled on that passage while rereading the books.

A Storm of Sword, Arya Chapter, Page 593:

The Brotherhood Without banner is on top of High Heart and Thoros, Lem and Beric are sitting with the Dwarf Witch and she says this:

""I dreamt a wolf howling in the rain, but no one heard his grief,"" the dwarf woman was saying. ""I dreamt such a clangor I thought my head might burst, drums and horns and pipes and screams, but the saddest sound was the little bells. I dreamt of a maid at a *feast with purple serpents in her hair, venom dripping from their fangs. And later I dreamt that maid again, slaying a savage giant in a castle built of snow"" She turned her head sharply and smiled through the gloom, right at Arya. ""You cannot hide from me, child. Come closer, now""*

And after that the dwarf women panic saying that Arya smell of death.

Now my theory is that the first part, the battle with the sad little bells, could be the burning of Kings Landing (it make sense in my head anyway) and the Maid would be Arya. The venom from her purple hair is used to kill Frey during is feast and the Savage Giant could be the Night King, the castle of snow Being Winterfell.

Now that I'm writing this I feel it's a bit of a stretch but I felt like sharing.

1059,"So I loved this show, I am so sad its over. I am so angry with how flat on it's face it fell at the end. In retrospect they should have merged season 7 with the first portion of 8 then stretched the last bit of 8 into its own full season. But that is not the road they went down. So the question remains, can you save game of thrones by just rewriting the last 6 episodes? I think its possible, and not only possible I want to do it with only 4.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 I felt episode 8.1 did a great job setting up the season, 8.2 was the high mark of the season so we are going to leave that untouched. If you could tack the good bits of 8.1 to the beginning of 8.2 and leave all the good of 8.2 that would be ideal and give you another episode to play with, but we aren't going that route.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\- First the Battle will play out in much the same way it did. Poor tactics and all. I can get past all that stupidity. Maybe make it look like more than 13 people make it out of this. (Ideally i think you have the Living do surprisingly well against the dead until the WW join the fight. Cause wouldn't that be cool WW actually fighting? It would also make Arya's jump off screen make more sense, less witnesses and all that jazz). But this post is going to be long enough without breaking down the whole damn battle.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Subverted Expectation's (hopefully properly) follow so be warned:

&amp;#x200B;

\- The NK kills Theon and begins his slow march towards Bran. We see the cool montage as our heroes make their last stands. Most of them play out the same way except more living folks (IE dothraki and Unsullied) to use later in the season so suddenly having what seems like a fully restocked army at KL isn't as jarring.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Splice these next scenes into the montage as you see fit. Once again im hitting the main points of what im changing for the sake of keeping this shortish.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Jon is huddled down behind the rock  hiding from Viserion, when he sees Arya. He nods to her and to the door leading to the God's Wood. She Nods back and Jon begins to pump himself up to stand and face his likely doom.

&amp;#x200B;

\-As Jon gets the dragon's attention we see Arya dart off towards the door, however she goes down one of the side doors instead of the main door. (maybe an ominous drumbeat here or something). As Arya enters the alcove she skids to a halt and the camera zooms out and we see a part of a white walker come into frame.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Viserion gets Ready to kill Jon but just as he is getting ready to something slams into the dragon. Then many more. The sound of caws can be heard as more and more black shapes slam into the dragon its body falling apart under the onslaught. Jon turns to see it is a huge flock of ravens (with milk white eyes if you are quick to spot it)

&amp;#x200B;

\- The shot cuts back to the NK who is almost to Bran, A single loud ravens caw breaks to music that had been welling. The NK turns his head back to see Jon standing in the Doorway Longclaw in hand. The NK Signals for his retinue of WW to part allowing him to take on Jon himself.

&amp;#x200B;

\-They Charge one another and an epic sword fight begins. Jon fights skillfully landing many blows that the NK seems to shrug off. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Eventually Jon is exhausted and the NK slaps Longclaw away throwing Jon to the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The Night King proceeds to beat Jon to the verge of unconsciousness and draws an ice dagger.

&amp;#x200B;

\-As he pulls the dagger, he is stopped from delivering a killing blow by some invisible force. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-The camera begins focus in on the weirdwood above his shoulder and zooms in. We see brann his hand touching the weirdwood, warg eyes, a frehsly carved symbol dripping with blood red sap a white walker symbol.

&amp;#x200B;

\- All of the WW are frozen in place. The NK with great effort begins to surge forward. Its clear the force he is battling is strong but he is a creature of sheer will. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-He becomes singularly focused on Bran. The camera will flash between him and brann, focusing only on their faces as he approaches.

\- As he approaches Bran's eyes go from milk white to blue. When the NK is almost to Bran the camera moves to Bran's face his eyes a deep dark pupiless blue .

&amp;#x200B;

\- Suddenly We here a sword cutting through flesh, we see bran gasp, his eyes quickly returning to their natural color but devoid of life. The camera pans down to a Valerian steel dagger plunged through his chest, as the camera pans back up it zooms out we Arya  over Bran's shoulder eyes locked on the NK, her eyes are losing the worg as the camera reaches them, shes starts to shudder as she realizes what has happened. We hear ice begin to crack. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Que disintegrating dead montage.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Add a scene  around when Danny is cradling jorah, of arya cradling brann, and jon holding arya.

&amp;#x200B;

Behind the episode. 

&amp;#x200B;

   My logic behind this is simple. It gives Brann something to do. It lets Arya fill her roll without having to be a literal flying plot device. I toyed around with having Arya take the face of the white walker, and stabbing the NK but it didnt feel right, and then you would have to address how the power of the faceless men applies to WW's.  Jon gets to fight the NK and is inadvertently responsible for ending the long night.

&amp;#x200B;

   I read the whole Jon Distracting the Dragon theory a while back, and I really liked It. I feel this scene shows the relationship between Jon and Arya. Jon knows he cannot reach the NK with the dragon in his way. He understands on some level what Arya has become. Arya on the other hand is driven, in this moment she is noone, she will accept her brother's sacrifice so she can get the job done. I made her run to the side because she is an assassin she is not going to charge in at the NK. She stumbles upon a white walker that she deals with off screen to give time for a fight betwen Jon and NK. 

&amp;#x200B;

Brandon's whole TER arc culminating in becoming king is dumb, pointless fantasy dribble. The fact that the Stark children for the most part get happy endings is once again dumb. Bran using his powers' and sacrificing himself ( a throw back to how he wanted to be an honourable knight) because of it is a rewarding end to the character. Using Arya as a weapon, allows for some more development of Arya. She will be a bit traumatized which i will delve into in my next post.

&amp;#x200B;

I really liked writing this out, and wanted to thank you for making it this far. I know the grammar is bad, and the spelling I am sure is even worse. Maybe next time i will just make a Youtube video instead lol.

1062,"The thing I think people fail to take into account for why seasons 7 and 8 had to accelerate in pace is that there’s less characters in the story by that point, and most of them have come together into the same place(s) and are sharing scenes, when in previous seasons, there were more characters scattered around in their own isolated scenes.

So what this means is that each character needed their own screentime before, so we would spend each episode jumping around from character storyline to character storyline, with each storyline progressing only a bit per episode. But with seasons 7/8, there’s more group scenes which develop all the characters’ storylines at the same time, which means we move along with all the characters more efficiently. We’re not getting any less scenes with each character, we’re just getting all the characters at the same time, so it takes less screentime to stay updated with them all. We don’t have to do 4 different scenes to keep up with Jon, Arya, Bran and Sansa, because we have all 4 in the same scene now. Season 8 may have the fewest episodes, but I think if you measured it out, it actually probably has the most screentime for Jon, Dany, Arya, Sansa, and MAYBE Bran, of any season.

For example, if Dany going mad had happened in like season 5 or 6... it wouldn’t have been given any more scenes... it would be the same number of scenes and same amount of screentime for Dany... it just would have been more broken up across more episodes, and thus it would give us more weeks in between scenes to experience it... whereas in season 8, there’s no need to jump around so much, so we can pack those scenes into one episode. Same amount of time with Dany, but we’re not spending time in between each of her scenes to check in with Maergery and Littlefinger and Theon and Arya in Braavos and Jon at Hardhome, etc... because most of them are dead and Jon and Arya are a part of Dany’s storyline now, so we check in with them all concurrently.

Personally, I kind of prefer it that way in many ways. Sure, you lose a bit of the intimacy with each individual character since they are usually in groups instead of on their own, but we get more of an ensemble feel with seasons 7 and 8, because all the characters are actually interacting with each other, and we’re focusing more on the larger story that plays between all of them. And it may feel like you’re getting less because it’s going by faster, but each episode feels more like a full movie, covering a more complete piece of storytelling than the previous seasons’ episodes did. I remember in seasons 1-6, each episode would often feel like it was just a tiny bite from each storyline, and it would often feel a bit too broken up. I would love an episode like Blackwater, where it stayed focused on one storyline (or two or three storylines converging) and more storytelling got completed in an episode to make it feel more complete as a piece. It feels faster, but it’s no less time spent with the characters. It’s just being shown more efficiently.",gameofthrones

1067," I feel like Daenerys is one of the worst characters in GoT.

I've started rewatching the series from the start and after 3 seasons shes just kinda got on my nerves. Every scene I see with her face in it she is doing that typical generic fantasy glare just off the camera at someone who is a bad person that she doesnt like all with really epig fantasy music telling me that she is really mighty and heroic and stuff.

And she snarks and sneers at everything everyone says and doesnt take shit from no one and is so cool and objective and awesome and it honestly feels cheap as shit and splits the show into two parts: one where everyone is human, (sort of) has gimmicks, qualities and flaws, and then theres across the pond where Daenerys is so awesomely awesome, I feel like there is an oversaturation of fantasy tropes with her that spoils the gritty, almost realistic boredom of a medieval society with conflicting politics and ideology and tension.

Daenerys just goes from one city to the other - one minor setback, and then comes out on top with some super extreme payoff that relies on the incompetency of everyone else (who is a bad guy). She just hops from city to city freeing slaves (basically single handedly) because she is really moral and stuff and she is supposed to gain the viewers approval.

We occasionally see Barristan or Jorah bicker about something random (because they dont actually seem to do anything important, its all Daenerys pretty much) or we just see Jorahs sad face when she does something epig and unorthodox or something.

It was fun to watch that fat merchant guy roast her over her shite diplomacy because she was still a rookie at the queen gig but since then she has been so epicly epic and all the people she doesnt like have been so stupidly stupid that its just not fun to watch at all. Id rather she just took that Yunkai guys offer and sailed off to Westeros to actually get shit started instead of this endless starvation of fun and stagnation of intrigue.",gameofthrones
1068,"We know that Dany's lack of fertility is made to be a pretty big point in seasons 1-7 and everyone just kinda forgot about the major possibility that Jon would get Dany pregnant. So where did this go? Well, D&amp;D is known for their subtle story telling, such as the cock jokes in season 8 meaning that Tyrion hasn't used his cock in this season and lost all intellect, subtle. Well with that we know that Dany isn't going to be declared pregnant, but will be shown in a indirect way.

Dany's child, never shown, plays an important role in the final episode of Game of Thrones. Starks are connected to warging and Targs are connected to dragons, so what would a Stargaryen be connected to? Warging into dragons. Just after Dany's death, we see Drogon approach Jon and it seems that he is about to get roasted, but last second he turns away and melts the iron throne. I believe this is caused by Dany and Jon's child warging into Drogon and deciding that they didn't want their daddy burnt so instead to destroy the thing that killed Dany, the throne. Now I know what you're thinking, a fetus couldn't possibly understand the metaphor for power that caused their moms death. And you'd be right, they instead think that the thing with swords sticking out of it stabbed their mom.

After burning the iron throne, the child still in the womb wants to be born. So without a second to say goodbye to their dad, they fly away and the baby is delivered. What comes next is up to you, but I think that D&amp;D have a good chance of making a fantastic sequel. Thanks for reading my shitpost.",gameofthrones

1078,"We all know how much damage Grey Wind did alone. He's one fucking direwolf.

Imagine if they had hundreds of them in their ranks. Or maybe they had certain military units who were direwolf trainers who led them into battle.

It's pretty clear that direwolfs are well over intelligent enough to know who is the enemy and who is the master. 

The Starks could have easily domesticated mass amounts of direwolfs. If they did this, it would probably have similar levels of lethality to the Targaryen dragons. 

Sure, direwolfs can't burn down cities. But mass units of direwolfs could decimate enemy military ranks before the main armies even engaged.

Some people think that direwolfs are nearly extinct. While this is true south of the wall, I've learned from the wiki that they exist in great number beyond the wall. 

It would be no trouble for Northerners to venture beyond the wall and acquire direwolfs over time until they had bread generations of direwolfs obedient to the Stark men and the other lords of the North.

This would have been especially helpful to the Northerners because their kingdom has a very low population, which probably contributes to the reason why Robb Stark could only amass 20000 men.

Direwolfs would be the key to their power.  Especially since wargs come from the first men blood in the North aswell.

1082,"I think it’s so badass that Sansa channels a lot from all her teachers in this scene. 
I think Sansa begins to play Littlefingers game when Dany mentions Jon. She wants to know Dany’s motives so she assumes the worst (the worst being Dany is power hungry and her only goal is power). Sansa says “men do stupid things for women” as a test to prove these assumptions and it works. 

Dany responds with “My whole life I have known one goal: the iron throne”(which I think that statement in and of itself is a red flag to Sansa because she has known other people with the same motivations). Dany says her sole purpose was the iron throne and that her sole reason for being there was her love for Jon, trying to manipulate Sansa to think she’s being honest. Jorah (being a northerner) knows the North is currently on Sansa’s side and that Dany needs to make peace with Sansa in order to have a peaceful relationship with the North. Dany thinks in order to make peace with the North(Sansa) she has to exploit the North(Sansa). Dany knows they both love Jon, so she uses Jon as a way to manipulate Sansa to make peace with Sansa. Sansa sees through Dany, that Dany is trying to manipulate her which confirms Sansa’s suspicions.

 Dany is speaking some truth that she does love Jon and that is part of the reason why she’s there but it is not the sole reason but Dany is acting like it is to trick Sansa. That yes Dany is there because she loves Jon but she’s there because she knows how big of a threat the NK is to her rule and her 7 kingdoms (he did kill her dragon) and she wants to gain the North on her side by bending the North to her will, either by manipulation or by force.  It’s why she’s trying to manipulate Sansa, to get Sansa to bend to her will but Sansa doesn’t fall for it. Sansa sees that Dany is using Jon as way to manipulate her. Dany shows to Sansa that she isn’t there to ally with the North, she’s there to control it. This is when Sansa sees Danys motives. Sansa realizes that Dany isn’t actually there to improve their relationship or make real allies with the North, she’s there to manipulate Sansa and get the North under her wing. Dany is there to make peace with the North(Sansa), but by control, not by actually making peace. 

Sansa knows it and after she learns Dany’s true motives, she wants to ask for the North’s independence as a final check to see if Dany actually wants a good alliance with the North and give the North what they want (or at least offer a compromise) or if Dany is all about power and control. So before Sansa asks she warms up to Dany first. Sansa wants to be on Dany’s good side before she drops the bomb. She does what Margaery does and chuckles and warms up to Dany by admitting a fault that she should’ve said thank you when Dany arrived to draw Dany in, and all the meanwhile Dany thinks she has Sansa within her grasps and the moment that Dany thinks she has Sansa on her side, Sansa drops the bomb about the North’s independence like Olenna or Cersei would and Dany loses control and her true colors just bleed out as clear as day. 

When this occurs Sansa really gets Dany’s motivations out in the open for her to see. Dany realizes that Sansa has caught her and that’s why she pulls her hand away. It effectively shows that Dany is just another tyrant who won’t accept less power for peace. Dany’s pissed that Sansa exposed her. That Dany could really care less about what the North wants and she’s all about what she wants. If Dany did care about the actual North then she wouldn’t have given such a volatile response when Sansa mentions the North’s independence and she wouldn’t have tried manipulating Sansa. Dany is just all about Dany. Her only goal is power. All Dany wants is power. That Dany is just more of the same. Such an awesome scene between two powerful characters trying to up each other in the game but unfortunately Dany doesn’t have the experience like Sansa and she doesn’t know how the game is played. Sansa makes Dany look like a fool. Sansa knows Dany for who she is now and Dany is only further away from where she was before.",gameofthrones

1084,"I’m a little late to the party but I just began watching GOT and just finished the last episode today. I agree with everyone that the writing was rushed and that they just coped out at the very end. However what pissed me off the most was how after they killed Daenerys that was just it. The whole show they talked about how her and Khal Drogo were going to meet in death. Even when she went to that house in the beginning (I can’t remember the name) and she saw him and the baby in the tent he said that he wasn’t going to go forward without her. 

Had they done a five minute fucking scene of her finding him in death with her baby in the tent before they went on I would have felt better about her ultimate demise. They alluded so much to this and the fact that her “great” ending was being killed and the dragon mourning her and carrying her off killed me. The great Mother of Dragons died...and that was it. Like really?!? That’s all you’re going to show?? I don’t feel like they properly ended her. They could have brought the thing full circle with her and him at the end. Out of all the things that disappointed me at the terrible ending of this great show this is what got me the most.

1090,"I’ve made a few comments recently pointing out some of the many mistakes the show runners made during the series including the Kingslayer flashback from Bran’s vision in which several things appear to be wrong with this scene and relating to it. From memory they include...

- Jaimie has his short hair like he does during the present instead of long hair (which doesn’t technically have to be a mistake; it’s possible he just had short hair back then in show canon, but let’s be real, they should have put a wig on him)

- When Jaimie reflects on this moment in the tub with Brienne in Season 3 he claims there were half a million people in the city at the time yet in Season 7 it’s stated multiple times there are now a million; an insanely large increase 

- *Jaimie is wearing the golden Kingsguard armor we see him and the rest of the Kingsguard wear at the start of the series instead of the silver Targaryen Kingsguard armor we see that they wore at the time during the Tower of Joy flashbacks*

I want to focus on the last of these because after just reading the second Jaimie chapter in ASOS it appears that this might have actually been an intentional decision to (kind of) reference the books. In the books the Kingsguard during both Aerys, Robert and Jorffery’s reign wear white armor and when Jaimie reflects about when he kills the mad king he notes that he was not wearing his Kingsguard armor when he entered the throne room, but instead his golden armor, and is annoyed that no one ever points that out, however he was still wearing his KG cloak and reflects that he should have taken it off.

It doesn’t quite translate to the show however because instead of the golden armor being a personal armor of Jaimie it is instead the same armor that becomes the standard for all of the KG during Robert’s reign so instead of looking like an intentional choice in the show it just looks like they put him in a uniform that didn’t exist yet. It’s still kind of sloppy, but not quite as sloppy as I originally thought. I get what they might have been going for (if they were in fact actually trying to reference this part of the books and it wasn’t a full-on continuity mistake) but without context or the same armor uniforms from book to show, it still ends up making little sense and a non-reader who picked up on this would have every reason to believe it made zero sense.

Maybe Jaimie’s personal armor became the new standard for everyone during Robert’s reign? A way to symbolize the alliance of Lannister and Baratheon? But Jaimie wasn’t even Lord Commander then and he was being pardoned...I feel like you don’t make your protectors dress like a guy you just had to pardon. Maybe Robert just preferred the way it looked to the less flashy armor of Areys’s reign. We know Robert liked to spend cash on frivolous stuff like that. I fear I might be thinking it through more than the showrunners did...",gameofthrones
1091,"So I have yet to watch a single episode of Game of Thrones which is pretty crazy consider that I love a good story, dragons, and boobs.

1092,"I'm genuinely interested on any thoughts you guys have on this theory I've been wrestling with lately—regarding Arya's fate intertwined with the whole faceless men storyline.The show left so many crucial plot points unresolved or open-ended... ~~one of the~~ **~~countless~~** ~~issues with season 8~~... So I've been racking my brain &amp; diving into countless fan theories in an attempt to create the pieces needed to fill these huge gaps in the grand puzzle that is the plot of Game of Thrones.

**Soooooo without further ado, for the sake of creative debate, here's the theory:**

Let's say that Arya was relentlessly recruited by the faceless men because they knew with their collective hive-minds that she'd be the one to eventually kill the Night King and end the long night.

They went to great lengths to manipulate her slowly, first through Syrio Forel, then obviously through Jaqen H'ghar⁠—who in this case *is* Syrio Forel, who escaped Meryn Trant off-screen, and then changed faces to escape the Red Keep and eventually work his way back to crossing paths with Arya again on the way to Harrenhal.(Obviously keeping to the show's storyline with Jaqen H'ghar, not the like in the books where he MAY have been known as the Alchemist in Old Town &amp; all that.)

So... Okay. Right. This ALMOST makes sense, because it explains why they just allowed her to leave the house of Black &amp; White without sending more assassins after her and all that jazz.

HOWEVER, that “collective hive-mind” thing all the true faceless men have is supposedly subservient to the Many Faced God/God of Death. They gave up their dreams, desires, identities, &amp; ultimately their *souls* to become no one... only an instrument for their God.That being said, isn’t the Night King &amp; his army supposed to be the EMBODIMENT of death? So therefore wouldn’t the faceless men see the Night King almost as a Jesus Christ-like figure???? Why would they be on a mission to manipulate a girl since childhood into killing the most powerful “living” manifestation of their God? *“There is only one god, and his name is Death.”*

 Also Jaqen made a point to instill in Arya how important it is to *""not steal from the Many Faced God""* or else *""a debt would have to be paid""*.  So wouldn't destroying the Night King &amp; the army of the dead be like the ultimate form of stealing from the God of Death? Or did she need to do this so Dany could then take on the ""role"" or ""mission"" of the Night King and become the  one who ""repays"" the God of Death by taking the lives of the hundreds of thousands in King's Landing???

As you can see I'm ending up with more questions than answers, but I must admit it's fun to ponder and try to connect the dots from the show's perspective, in order to try and scratch that psychological itch I have to answer the questions D&amp;D never bothered to touch base on.

1098," I'm completely unspoiled on the details. I know that there is loud dissatisfaction. I disliked the direction they were taking things in seasons 6 and 7, as I began to sense Hollywood Values seeping into the storytelling and character designs. My questions (please no spoilers):

\-is the outcry a result of an ambiguous ending?

\-does season 8 re-contextualize any of the characters in a deleterious way?

\-does season 8 continue channeling the 201X American political ideology that crept into 6 and 7?

\-does it turn into a postmodern deconstruction of the franchise?

\-did they fail to elegantly wrap up all of the storylines in the final few episodes?

Reason for question:

I do not want my positive feelings for the franchise damaged and I would be satisfied with head canon branching from season 7, thus I'm willing to steer clear of season 8. 6 and 7 damaged characters I enjoyed in the books and took things in what I felt were silly and clumsy directions.

No one proposes capturing a wight and bringing it back as proof, an obvious suicide mission. Instead, Jon asks Daenerys to fly north with her dragons to the Wall, to see the threat for herself. If Jon is lying, she can return her focus to King's Landing with only a few days lost. If he is right, she will get the opportunity to measure the threat with her own eyes. Daenerys’s advisors argue over whether this is a good idea.

As they consider this option, Daenerys repositions her troops from Dragonstone to strengthen their position against Cersei. While sailing in transit, her navy is again caught off-guard in a devastating ambush. Euron Greyjoy kills Viserion with a scorpion, destroys dozens of ships, and captures Missandei. Yara Greyjoy barely escapes and flees back to the Iron Islands. Daenerys retreats with the rest of her forces.

Enraged, Daenerys shuts down any talk of traveling north and turns her full focus to King’s Landing. She issues Cersei an ultimatum: release Missandei and relinquish the throne or see the Red Keep burn to the ground. Tyrion pleads with her to reconsider, and Daenerys threatens to depose him as Hand of the Queen if he does not get on board. Varys, concerned, quietly helps Jon Snow flee back to the north while Daenerys is distracted. Daenerys has decided she cannot help the northerners until Cersei is gone, and Varys fears Daenerys will keep Jon Snow captive until Jon bends the knee, preventing him from leading the fight against the dead. ""Gather what troops you can, find your strongest defensive position, and guard the north,"" Varys advises Jon. ""Every house in Westeros depends on you now, though none of them will help you.""

Jon flees north. Daenerys, furious to find that Jon has left without her knowledge, begins mistrusting Varys, although he and Tyrion manage to convince her to allow the continued mining and shipment of dragonglass northward. In the meantime, Daenerys meets Cersei at the walls of King's Landing. As in season 8, Cersei executes Missandei in front of Daenerys. Daenerys's makes up her mind: it is time for war.

The night before the attack on King's Landing, Tyrion manages to contact Jaime, who is in Kings Landing with Cersei. Tyrion begs him to convince Cersei to surrender and ring the bells of King's Landing as soon as they see the fight is lost. The attack on King's Landing proceeds similar to the events of Season 8 Episode 5, with a few differences. First, Daenerys manages to protect her two surviving dragons from the scorpions (which she now knows to be a threat) through a tactical maneuver. She realizes the Lannisters expect an attack from outside the walls of the city and have aimed the scorpions outward. To surprise them, she flies over the scorpions above the clouds, safely out of view, and descends from the sky at the *center* of the city. Sending one dragon to the walls and another to the bay, she attacks the scorpions from behind, destroying them before they can be turned around.

As in Season 8, she burns a hole clear through King's Landing's walls, allowing the Dothraki and Unsullied to charge in. After pitched street battles, the bells are rung. Daenerys, still enraged, chooses to fly straight to the Red Keep and burns it down, crushing and burning the hundreds of human shields hiding there along with Jaime and Cersei. Along the way, Daenerys also torches hundreds of surrendered, unarmed Lannister soldiers on the streets. She doesn't attack civilians indiscriminately as in Season 8, but the devastation is terrible nonetheless.

Once in charge of King's Landing, Daenerys begins to purge the city of Lannister loyalists, executing dozens who served Cersei whose pledges of surrender and allegiance she does not trust.

In the meantime, the dead have reached the Wall. Jon leads a defense of Castle Black, where northern troops have assembled hundreds of barrels of hot oil to stop the dead. The Night King sends tens of thousands of dead to climb up the wall, rows and rows of them, one after another. They overwhelm the living, tossing live soldiers off the top of the wall, forcing Jon and the northerners to retreat. Once the dead reach the top, they pause in a moment of unnerving stillness. Slowly, silently, they lean over the top of the wall and fall downwards, landing in Castle Black by the hundreds with sickening crunches. The falling corpses crescendo into a thunder and then suddenly stop, followed by another moment of perfect silence. The Night King lifts his hands and the dead rise again within Castle Black. They methodically open the gate of the Wall from the inside. A hundred thousand wights march through the gate and head southward towards Winterfell.

Jon knows that King's Landing is at war and is uncertain what has happened there. He concludes the northerners cannot hope to save the north nor Winterfell, and so leads a full retreat of the living to the Twins, abandoning his home. The Riverlands, he decides, represents their best hope to stop the Night King. It offers a natural fortress, a moat, and a chokepoint through which the dead can hopefully be stalled until help arrives. He sends urgent ravens to King's Landing and Dragonstone pleading for help.

At the Twins, the living prepare for their battle with the dead. Jon destroys the bridge, which will force the dead to cross through water. Bran and Sam tell Jon he is Aegon Targaryen, and word of this revelation begins to spread. As Jon grapples with this news and thinks through his battle preparations, he asks Bran for guidance, hoping to get wisdom from the Three Eyed Raven.

In response, Bran tells him the story of how the Night King was born. ""The Children of the Forest faced an existential threat,"" Bran explains. ""And they defended themselves with an apocalyptic weapon. Soon, we, too, will face the same question. What are we prepared to sacrifice to win this war?"" Jon begs for clearer guidance, but Bran responds cryptically: ""I must go now. The Night King will come for me. Protect me, at all costs, until the very end.""

The dead arrive, and an epic battle ensues similar to Season 8 Episode 3. The northerners, the Knights of the Vale, and the freefolk valiantly hold the dead off with flaming trenches (courtesy of Melisandre of course), dragonglass arrows, and heavy ballista. But the dead pile on top of one another to cross the moats of water and fire and soon overwhelm the living. Brienne of Tarth, leading the vanguard, is buried under a wave of undead within moments and torn apart. Tormund and Gendry are also killed in the fighting. Beric Dondarrion and the Hound give their lives to save Arya. Arya, in turn, saves Jon, so that he can find Bran and lead the retreat. Arya chases after them, but the earth beneath her feet crumbles under the weight of the dead, sending her falling into the river. The dead being to enclose on the fleeing survivors when at the last moment jets of flame from Daenerys's dragons streak overhead, cleaving a safe path for those still alive to retreat. Arya and many others are left for dead.

The northerners flee to King's Landing as the dragons slow the advance of the army of the dead. Unsullied and Dothraki dig a series of flaming trenches along the route to King’s Landing to give the living time to prepare new defenses.

In King's Landing, Daenerys locks up Jon, Sansa, and the northern lords, demanding that they bend the knee to her. She has learned who Jon is and decides she must force them to bow now, before the dead arrive, while there still exists an existential threat to unify all of Westeros behind her banner.

Sansa begs Jon not to give in, reasoning that Daenerys will need the northerners to defeat the dead and will eventually relent. Jon agonizes over whether to bend the knee as Varys begins scheming to overthrow Daenerys in favor of Jon. Daenerys discovers this and burns Varys alive. Tyrion, disillusioned, throws away his Hand of the Queen medallion. Daenerys, with anger and sadness, considers whether to execute Tyrion as well. Fearing further loss of life and time as the dead march southward, Jon thinks back to Bran's words and decides to bend the knee on the condition that Daenerys spare Tyrion and cease her executions of Lannisters who have surrendered. She agrees, and the northerners bitterly follow Jon's lead.

While this is happening, we intersperse with shots of Bran wharging back in time. We see how King Aerys Targaryen first took the throne as a strong, wise king. These shots are interspersed with flashbacks of Daenerys’s journey to the iron throne, setting up a parallel between the rise – and, perhaps, fall – of both rulers, father and daughter.

Finally, the dead close in on King's Landing. The city is greatly weakened from Daenerys's attack, with no Red Keep and a gaping hole burned in its outer walls. Neither are there any ships left, as all have been burned by dragonfire. There will be no retreat.

A final epic battle with the dead ensues. The Dothraki are sent outside the city to flank the lines of the dead on horseback and whittle away at their numbers via dragonglass arrows. They are accompanied by a portion of the Unsullied forces who take up positions outside of the city to funnel the dead to strategic chokepoints. Jon and Daenerys plan to buy enough time for them to assassinate the Night King, who has adopted a defensive position behind his army, with the surviving two dragons. They scorch their way through the undead and reach the Night King, and for a moment it appears they are poised to kill him with dragonfire. But suddenly, one after the other, Drogon and Rhaegal are hit by ice spears flung by White Walkers. Jon and Daenerys fall with the dragons to their deaths.

The dead cleave their way through to King's Landing. They pour through the hole in the outer wall and make their way through the city towards the ashes of the Red Keep, slaughtering soldiers and civilians along the way. Grey Worm and the remaining survivors make their last stand at city center, when the Night King arrives. Raising his hands, he brings the recently slaughtered residents of Kings Landing back to life. They begin their inexorable march towards the last of the survivors.

Cut to shots of Tyrion, Sansa, Grey Worm, Jorah, Bronn, and other main characters' faces as they realize: this is the end.

We cut to Bran who is sitting in one of the few remaining rooms of the Red Keep, his eyes closed. The *Light of the Seven*musical theme, from season 6 episode 10, begins playing in the background. We cut back and forth between Bran’s visions of King Aerys and the frenzied last stand the living are now taking against the dead. In current day King's Landing, soldiers frantically shout ""Burn them! Burn them all!"" as they shoot flaming arrows and toss torches at buildings in a desperate attempt to stop the dead. Hodor-style, these shots merge with Bran's visions of King Aerys, who begins shuddering. Shouts of ""Burn them! Burn them all!"" ring in the background as we see Bran’s meddling transform a once stoic Aerys into the mad king. We montage through his crazed reign, watching him torch Ned Stark's father and brother alive, watching him laugh as his enemies writhe in wildfire, watching him command his pyromancer to burn down King’s Landing.

Cut to Tyrion, who is watching from behind the fighting as the dead push into the final lines of Unsullied. His face darkens with a new resolve and he begins running.

Cut back and forth between the Mad King yelling ""Burn them all!"" and Tyrion running into the dungeons and sewers beneath King's landing. Suddenly, a moment of clarity and stillness appears in Bran’s visions. A single moment snaps to life: the Mad King commanding his pyromancers to fill every corner of King's Landing’s sewers with jars of wildfire. ""Stock it under Flea Bottom, under the Sept of Baelor, under the streets, under the walls, under the Red Keep,"" he commands wildly. We see the pyromancers carefully placing endless jars of wildfire throughout the underground. Cut back to the dead, present-day, who are nearly atop Grey Worm's last line of soldiers. Sansa and the last line of unarmed survivors behind the Unsullied tremble in fear and close their eyes, preparing to die.

Final cut to Tyrion, who is now holding a torch underground. He has spilled out jars and jars of wildfire before him. Closing his eyes, he drops the torch.

We see a stunning, birds-eye shot of King's Landing filled with undead in concentric circles around a final circle of Unsullied defending the last of the living at city center. After a moment of silence, we see green fire explode through the streets of the city, tearing the entire capital apart in a roaring blaze of light. Everyone within the city walls is killed, including the Night King. The tens of thousands of dead still outside the city collapse as the Night King's magic dissipates.

As the dust settles and the wildfire slowly dies down, survivors eventually make their way to the ashes of King’s Landing. The Iron Throne is no more. Virtually all the great houses are gone. But survivors across Westeros who escaped the Night King's path trickle in to see what is left of their kingdom. Lords, soldiers, and other survivors from Dorne, the Vale, the Iron Islands, Highgarden, and elsewhere arrive. The surviving Dothraki and Unsullied who fought outside the city return as well. Daario Naharis arrives from Meereen with the Second Sons, having heard that Daenerys’s forces were under siege. He is devastated to learn of her death. An emissary from the Iron Bank, with the Golden Company in tow, arrives, planning to place the surviving lords of Westeros under Braavos's vassalage to force them to repay Cersei's debt. All parties begin to argue over who should rule Westeros. New battle lines are drawn.

As tensions reach a boiling point, a figure suddenly emerges from the falling ash in the distance. The lords look up and find, to their shock, a bloody but determined Daenerys marching towards them. Daario Naharis, the Dothraki, the Unsullied, and Yara Greyjoy immediately unite behind her command and present a unified front against the other lords. With steel in her voice, Daenerys commands them to bend the knee, and one after another they obey. She turns to the outnumbered emissary from the Iron Bank and tells him he will forgive all debts and cease to finance the wars of other nations forevermore, or she will flatten Braavos. Terrified, he agrees and flees with the Golden Company.

The survivors slowly begin to rebuild as a fierce Daenerys consolidates her power. Finally, she calls a council of the surviving lords and ladies of Westeros.

""When I came to Westeros, I swore that I would break the wheel in which powerful families crush those beneath them in their constant struggle for power,"" she says. ""I intend to keep that promise. You have all pledged to follow me as your queen. But who will you follow when I am gone? Who will your children follow? My descendants will not be bound to rule with my sense of justice, just as I am not bound by my father's madness. Together, are we not simply recreating the insanity of the wheel?""

""In all of my travels,"" she continues, ""I have come across only one city that has progressed beyond the savagery of the wheel, where the many are not preyed upon by the few. It is a city that has flourished, that has accumulated vast riches, without relying on slavery or serfdom for its keep. Its name is Qarth. The merchant council that ruled Qarth showed me only cruelty and deceit. But their job was not to show mercy to foreigners. Their duty was to serve the residents of their city. And they did so well.""

""As long as one house rules the Seven Kingdoms, the wheel persists,"" she says. ""And so, from today onwards, I abdicate and abolish the throne. There will be no more Kings or Queens in Westeros. Instead, the lords and ladies here today will rule together as a council. Each year a different lord will serve as lead council member and steward of the Seven Kingdoms. Daario, you will lead the council in its first year, and your task will be to establish by consensus a set of rules through which the council will govern itself.""

""The Unsullied,"" she continues, turning to their commander, ""will remain the protectors of the realm. They will hold loyalty not to any lord or house, but to the rules governing this council. They will ensure no house takes control over the others, and that the council never abrogates its duty to rule on behalf of all the people of Westeros. As free men, any of the Unsullied may choose to leave and pursue their own lives across Westeros. But you will also allow young men and women across the kingdom to join your forces if they prove strong of mind, body, and character.""

The lords and ladies sit in stunned silence. Finally Daario says, ""My queen, what of you? Will you not lead the council?""

Daenerys smiles. ""I have done my part here. I will leave this place and find another people, in another corner of the world, in need of liberation."" She leaves the chamber as the assembled nobles grapple with the news.

Daario chases after her to her chambers. ""My queen!"" He says. ""I don't understand. You have spent your entire life fighting for the iron throne. This kingdom needs you. How can you leave now?""

She shakes her head. ""I'm not the same woman I once was,"" she tells him. ""Give up, Daario. Enough. Stay here and bring a new dream to life.""

Daario shakes his head. ""What happened to you since Meereen?"" He asks. ""Who have you become?""

With a glimmer in her eye, turning back one last time as she opens the backdoor out of her chambers onto the ramparts outside, she responds: ""No one.""

The *Many Faced God* musical theme comes on as Daenerys closes the door behind her and leaves a stunned Daario behind. Smiling, she lifts a hand under her chin and pulls back her face to reveal: Arya Stark.

We see Arya walk to the docks of King's Landing and embark on a ship for a new adventure.

**TL,DR:**

Night King defeats the northerners and heads down to King's Landing.

Bran travels back in time to make the mad king go mad, so that he will fill King's Landing with jars of wildfire, so that Tyrion can use the wildfire to blow up all of King's Landing along with the army of the dead and kill the Night King.

Daenerys survives and creates a new council of lords and ladies to jointly rule Westeros, abdicating her claim to the throne - but in the last scene we learn this was actually Arya wearing Daenerys's face.

&amp;#x200B;

*In case clarification is needed: Arya survives her fall at the Twins but arrives at King’s Landing only after the dead are defeated. She finds Daenerys's body on the way, and takes Daenerys's face.*",gameofthrones

1116,"So, after Season's 8 disappointment, I decided to go on a journey and read the Books. I was super motivated, especially because I know that after Season 7 or something, the Series diverged from the Books, and since there are two new ones on the horizon, I would get tons of new content.

The issue is that, I started Book 1 a few days back and I can't keep my head off the TV Show. Let's be honest, it's kinda annoying reading about the presentation of  a character and already knowing much of their main plot.

Of course this is not avoidable right, I can't just forget the plot, but I would like at least to picture the characters in my own head, as I do with other books that I read, but I just picture the actors who played that role!!

If there's anyone that went through the same situation as me, can I do anything to make my experience more pleasant? I've thought about doodling myself or finding some software that builds a character based on description to have those images on my head instead of the TV Show ones...

Thanks in advance for any replies!

1117,"After the dissapointing end of the tv series I decided to finally pick up the books which I had already bought. And I gotta say the beginning was basically identically to the series (to its credit) so I was a bit unmotivated to keep going for the first book as I expected it to be the exact same as the show.
I just finished Bran's chapter that starts at page 237, in which Tyrion and the Nights Watch arrive at Winterfell.

The chapter doesnt really divert much as the show except for the ending, when Robb carries Bran to his bed and they share a moment in the darkness, exchaning few words but establishing them as real people. Real children, scared children. But even though they're both scared they have each other to rely on.

And this scene alone made me feel way more for Robb and Bran than I ever did during the entire show. I already dread the Red Wedding again. But now I wanna read more, be more invested and feel with these characters.",gameofthrones

figures are From [https://www.goldderby.com/odds/combined-odds/emmy-awards-nominations-2019/](https://www.goldderby.com/odds/combined-odds/emmy-awards-nominations-2019/)

Some points: 

Best Drama - Still odds on favourite to win, largely as a lot of shows have sat out this year. Trailed by Killing Eve, Better Call Saul, This is Us, Ozark, Succession, Homecoming, Pose, Bodyguard, and The Good Fight.

Best Actor Drama - Only Kit Harington (Jon) nominated. Odds are 10/1. Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul), Jason Bateman (Ozark) and our former King of The North Robb Stark aka Richard Madden (Bodyguard) are at the top of the pool

Best Actress - Only Emilia Clarke (Dany) nominated. Sandra Oh from Killing Eve is odds on favourite to win however she does have Jodie Comer from the same show in this category which may not help. 

Best Supporting Actor - Peter Dinklage (Tyrion) is a huge odds on favourite to win - almost all pundits expect that he is going to win this award. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime) is third favourite, expected to get nominated. He was nominated for season 7 but lost to Dinklage. Alfie Allen (Theon) was a previously unknown nomination so odds may increase but is still at more than 100/1, as is Pilou Asbaek (Euron) and Richard Dormer (Beric) (also both newly advised nominations in the last week or so)

Best Supporting Actress - Massively tight category not considered to have substantial competition outside of GoT. We are expected to have multiple nominations, up to four of six. Lena Headey (Cersei) and Maisie Williams (Arya) are tied with Julia Garner (Ozark) for best odds. Sophie Turner (Sansa) is also in the top 10 as is Gwendoline Christie (Brienne) who is a late nomination whose odds are going up. This is a category that does not favour young actresses historically which will hinder Maisie and Sophie as will as Garner from Ozark. Maisie has been nominated previously however Sophie has not been nominated in eight seasons. Lena has been nominated multiple times but has never won. I believe this is the first time Gwendoline has been put on the ballot/been in the race. The other major competitor is Rhea Seehorn from Better Call Saul who has the advantage of no other significant female competition from her show, but she has a history of being nominated and not winning. 

Best Guest Actress - Carice Van Houten (Melisandre) is the only nomination, she is in the top 5 (for episode 3, of course)

Best Guest Actor - No Nominations, I don't think anyone substantial made the criteria.",gameofthrones

1123,"I (along with plenty others) have been thinking a lot about Daenerys's fall into madness in GoT S8. Everyone knows how poorly it was handled, but part of me wonders if somewhere in this mess of a character arc there's a seed of something GRRM intended for her from the start that D&amp;D botched. It's recently come out that King Bran was an idea GRRM gave to D&amp;D ahead of time, along with ""Hodor = Hold the door"". If this is the case for Bran, could Dany's fall from grace be something else GRRM prompted for D&amp;D?

First of all we have to look at who Dany is. My knowledge of her right now is based only on what I've seen in the show and what I've read in the first book, so there may be some things I'm missing. But my impression is that Daenerys Targaryen is a girl who, after enduring prolonged abuse and objectification in unfamiliar countries amidst hostile people, developed a strong sense of justice for the innocent and a refusal to negotiate with those who subjugate and oppress the less fortunate.

No matter how you cut it, justice for the innocent isn't an ideology that allows for the massacre of one million people after an unconditional surrender. However, I think it's an ideology that may still allow for a fall from grace. In S5, we see how Dany's justice isn't quite as effective once she starts to experience the gray morals of a world she'd seen as black and white. 

Without getting too political, I think it can be said that those who have genuinely good intentions can still do harm to others. A black and white view of the world leads to generalizations, which in turn lead to misunderstandings and divisions, which in turn creates conflicts that could be avoided through a less binary view of morality and the world. With Danaerys set up to inherit a great amount of power and influence, this ideology could over time lead to tyranny despite her good intentions.

In the end, I think that Dany's fall from grace won't come from unchecked slaughter, but from her refusal to bend her view of justice in the face of a world more ambiguous than she believed it to be. I think in *The Winds of Winter* and *A Dream of Spring*, the story of Daenerys Targaryen will end as a cautionary tale of the good that justice can do in a cruel world while also warning against letting justice create tyrants.",gameofthrones

1127,"What if 15 to 20 years down road someone remakes the ASOIAF series as movies similar to the MCU.  First round of movies Jon, Dany, Tyrion and Ned each get a movie covering roughly the first book.  Catlyn could be a supporting character in either Ned’s or Tyrion’s movie.  

Then second round Arya and Rob each get movies while the series covers the second book while Sequels are made for the other main characters.  
Maybe far down the line Jaqen H’ghar gets a movie showing the back story to whatever sneaky shit he’s up to in the books.  They could fix the Dornish and High Garden plots and portray the battle of slavers bay accurately. 

LOTR series has been adapted many of times into cartoons, movies and video games so could ASOIAF.  Also it would probably make a boat load of cash.  Also there would be a lot more battles than the show.  And also we could a better ending because the book series (hopefully) will be finished by that point.",gameofthrones

1129,"Im someone who liked season 8, so im happy with how it really played out. I still had a showerthought about a different twist in season 8, it might have been said before though. 

We learn preferably already in season 6, but it’s fine only in season 8, that The Night King has really powerful warging abilities, just like Bran. They could have some warging battles maybe somewhere (I dont exaclty know how that would work though). 

Then, in the long night episode, everything is the same as it is now (maybe with some updated battle tactics) but when The night king reaches Bran, he touches him and wargs into Bran. Arya than kills the body of the night king, everyone is happy and Bran still looks like normal, he doesnt show much emotion anyway. 

Sometimes we would see Bran struggling in his mind to get him out, but the night king has full control over his body. Now the night king would use being inside Bran to a whole lot evil. In the end Bran wins his body back, but is already sentenced to death/rotting away in his cell for the actions the night king has done. Tragic but truthful.

1134,"Season 1 they poised Jamie as this killer swordsman and witty one liner comebacks. But after S1, since he was captured by Rob, Jamie never got the upper hand in shit talking. Jamie was always left speechless. 

Go back and see, whenever someone was talking shit Jamie would say his part, sharp tongue and all but then left wordless. Like at Joffrey‘s wedding when he was taking to Loras about how Cersei would kill the baby if Loras were to manage to impregnate her and how Loras will never marry her. But then Loras says “neither will you”. 

There’s plenty of these were Jamie is just left standing there looking stupid. Like when The queen of thorns Olenna Tyrell. She tells Jamie she killed Joffrey and she wanted Cersei to know it was her. He just stood there. Sure she already drank the poison but if it was me, after hearing that I would’ve chopped her fucking head off. She’s still alive, breathing. But nope, he just looks down, and walks away.

1136,"My favorite thing about Game of Thrones is and has always been the use of perspective. Perspective in this case meaning just who is in the limelight, what is their thought process. Even as it applies to characters of dubious morality.

I have two examples: the Dothraki and the Wildlings. In a more simplistic (not that that’s inherently bad) fantasy, they would be unquestioningly the bad guys, the faceless horde of savages that needs to be destroyed. Not in Thrones though, we spend a huge amount of time with both groups to learn about them and how they see the world. I, for one, didn’t even realize that the Wildlings were dangerous until they attacked that farm and the Dothraki were always were lovably quirky. In fact I would say the greatest trick ASOIAF ever played on the fans was distracting us from just how bad the Dothraki were in season 1 up until Mirri Maz Duur laid out what they did to her and her village.

I’m not going to talk about The Bells, but I’ve always seen Daenerys’ plotline as a villain origin story, but you could easily be forgiven for thinking she’s the hero because she freed slaves, she inspires people, she’s a noble and beautiful queen that takes hits and keeps on coming. Then you go back and think from the perspective of others. During seasons 3 and 4 The Dragon Queen flexed her children like crazy and threatened to obliterate anyone who opposed her. She declared war on several cities just for practice, she crucified hundreds of nobles, many of whom deserved it but still, and she destroyed the economy of Slaver’s Bay by not creating an actual alternative to the slave trade. That's not even the worst of it. Hell in the books apparently, some of the Smallfolk still preferred The Mad King because he wouldn't have tolerated Gregor Clegane running wild in the Riverlands like other ""more sensible"" kings.

So yeah, masterful writing on that count. Do you agree, disagree or favor something else?",gameofthrones
1137,"For those who have read Fire and Blood, there is a scene where Jaehaerys I’s wife Alysanne tries to fly her dragon, Silverwing, beyond the wall, but the dragon refuses. She notes that her dragon has never gone against her will before.

So my question is: if Silverwing was reluctant to fly beyond the wall (presumably because of the sensed threat of white walkers), why did Dany’s dragons fly there in the show?

I know the simple answer is that they didn’t have source material so the show writers did this to create a more dramatic story. I’m looking for any theories, no matter how crazy, as to why this is.",gameofthrones
1138,"So, Southern westeros is based on England/France/Old Germany..

Northern westeros is based on Scotland/ maybe a little Viking inspiration.

Western Essos is based on eastern / southern Europe I believe. 

Middle Essos is based on the middle East (near the bone mountains that divide the continent ).

Sothoros is definitely based on Africa.

Ulthos is based on.... Well , I don't know, but I would really like to know, because on maps it's covered in black just like the shadow lands.

So what is far eastern Essos past the bone mountains?

Well, we have the great empire of the dawn(Yi Ti) which is obviously based on ancient China and southeast Asia.

We have a nation of nomadic people who ride zebras and have pointed heads. These people rape and pillage and kill people. They remind me of the mongol horde, kinda like the dathraki but weirder.

There's a place that's like oceana, it's a thousand islands where a race of highly aggressive green people reside.

But most interesting of all, is the shadow lands, and asshai. I am beyond interested in this place. It would be so cool to see it and know more about it. Shadowbinders, necromancers, evil fockers, it sounds so amazing.

So, on this side of Essos , they had their own version of the long night. They said that a blood stone emporer killed his sister and triggered their own version of the long night that lasted a generation, just like westeros in the age of heroes. It is said that demons came from the Grey waste, a frozen desert north of The empire of the dawn. They constructed 5 forts to hold off demons that came from the waste(speculation).  They also have their own version of Azur Ahai, the hero who saved them all.

On top of that, there are many creepy things going on this side of the world that are inspired by HP Lovecraft. C'thulu and shit. It sounds so great.

I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A SPIN OFF ON THIS SIDE OF THE WORLD.

The maps don't even cover all of Essos. There's so much more to be seen. Maybe we could find out what's on Ulthos and Sothoros too.

I love the world Lore in this series.

I would also love a show centered in this universe, but on the more Asian styled side of the world. It would be great.

But once the Starks manage to kick some Bolton ass and retake Winterfell, House Glover is loyal again.  Continuing right along with those ""thousand years"" of loyalty!

GoT is a vicious world where alliances blow around like the wind.  Does anyone speak the words of loyalty ""for a thousand years"" with a straight face?  Is this public mythology?  Comic exaggeration?  Where is the credibility that anything *ever* lasted a thousand years, let alone house loyalty?

I listened to “Power is Power” originally then started rotating the album regularly. One thing that sticks out to me is the foreshadowing and spoilers thrown in lyrically, and I’m confused about the production process. 

For instance, with the aforementioned track, an original listen might allude to Jon Snow’s death. But after the end of the series, it’s a loose narration of the final episode. Thing is, the song came out around the time of episode 2. 

Based on home closely production was holding the plot and ending, and everyone was sworn to secrecy, how were so many artists involved with the lyrics and implications therein? And typically, with a project like this, how does it work?

Were lyrics written beforehand then disseminated to the artists who worked in the songs, and then were they forced to sign NDAs? So, in theory, did The Weeknd know the end of the series before we did? Did they have a hand in the writing?

Just very interesting given the concept all together and I’m interested in knowing more about it.",gameofthrones
1151,"  
Feeling entitled to make your own decisions creates a sense of empowerment. Empowerment is the process that creates power in the individuals over their own lives, society and in their communities. Empowerment includes raising the status of women through education and raising awareness etc.

  
Game of Thrones, a global phenomenon worldwide, out of its many lessons, gave a tenor on women empowerment in its elusive way. 

  
For those of you who have read my previous article, the following are the two events that had a significant impact on the survival of House Stark, showed us when difficulty reaches its extent women can go toe to toe with men. One Event was the red wedding and the other one was the battle for Winterfell.

  
Three main Houses, the Lanisters, the Freys, and the Boltans conspired to destroy a single house, only because it was becoming too powerful under a Lannister hegemony. They knew they can’t defeat them in a battle so they conspired to decimate it at a wedding.

  
The second event exhibits vengeance taken by Jon Snow for his Family from the Boltans, who betrayed the Starks. He not only avenged his family but also took back control in the north.

  
Arya, the youngest girl of the Stark family vanquished House Frey all at once by herself. She waited a long time to avenge her mother’s murder and when it came, she was enough for all of them.

  
For those of you who’ve watched the series, relive these events as they were the most conspicuous and quite breathtaking at the same time.  

  
The firstborn of Eddard Stark, the eldest of them all was horribly killed at his cousin’s wedding. He was killed along with his wife and mother. The couple just learned about they were expecting their first child, right before the event and were celebrating along, until tragedy ripped them apart.

  
After seeing her children being slaughtered, she gathered her strength and stood on her feet. For indeed the pain she was confronting now, was nothing as compared to the pain she felt at the time of her life when she was honored with her first ever child and braced it graciously for nine straight months. To see him in this vulnerable condition, among the ruthless murderers she could not bear, something happened. Against all her odds, she managed to walk to the Lord with an arrow struck on her back and one on her leg. Time stood still as the house witnessed with all their conscience, a mother pleading for the life of her child. She had nothing for the exchange of her son's life, except the honor the Starks had for generations.

  
She reminded them who she was, the wife of an honored man of the honored house to which they all had sworn allegiance. She even swore she'll forget the matter as if it never happened, just to let her legacy live, just let her son go. But the Lord said, why would he do that, what benefit will he get, if he spared her son’s life? For indeed he was promised gold by the lanisters. The Earth shattered after seeing what its inhabitants did to a Mother of five. The mother saw her firstborn stabbed to death in front of her, those eyes which glowed with full joys of spring when they first saw her own flesh and blood, were just left Hopeless. She accepted her fate and they slit her throat to death.

  
All the main lords of House Starks and those who pledged their loyalty to them, served them well indeed, till the end and died, except for the Boltans as they were the only ones who betrayed them. It took three houses to destroy one audacious house for indeed, they were far too be brave to be destroyed all for once. In order to destroy such a dauntless house, one must have to plant the seed of betrayal and that’s exactly what the Lanisters did and used the Boltans, as their bait, whom the Young Lord, Robb Stark trusted blindly, and that's how this great house was pulled apart from their roots.

  
Catelyn Stark, indeed played a strong role of a mother, reminding all of us again that God gave mothers a status not just like that, He had a reason, a purpose that is the reason why He chose them after Himself.

  
The Lanisters, the Freys, and the treacherous Boltans played their game indeed and thought they played it well but who knew, the very same house will turn their worst nightmares into reality, especially as the Boltans and the Freys had no idea, what was coming for them. For indeed when a wolf comes with vengeance, all the animals, not even the Lion is able to stand its ground.

  
The battle for Winterfell was the consequence of the death of Eddard Stark’s fourth son who was held captive by the Boltans and was murdered in front of them. The Battle was heavily outnumbered for the Starks, as they had lost their Majority before in red wedding, were breathing their last verge of existence when more armed forces joined them and defeated the Boltans.

  
Sansa, the elder of the two sisters made a pact with the knights of Vale, another ally of House Stark, just days before her Valiant Bastard Brother officially declared the war against the Boltans, despite having fewer men, as many of the noble the household who’ve pledged themselves for centuries forcibly abandoned their perpetual pledge as they’ve just witnessed the brutal massacre of the same honored house their ancestors pledged themselves and stood beside this audacious house, for centuries. The Knights of Vale, the only house that responded to Sansa‘s call and succored to House Stark.  As much as Jon played a major role in destroying the Boltans, Sansa played hers assuring the house extinction from its history.

  
Arya the assassin took the House Frey all by herself. She first murdered the two sons of their lord and carved them into a pie. Then she disguised herself as a slave and offered it to the Lord who ate them without knowing what was in it. She then killed him just like the way her mother was decimated, he was slit throat to death.

  
Master of disguise, she now came in as their lord, wearing his filthy face mask as she knew what this thing meant for her, and had to be done. She called a meeting, in which all the members of the house were invited. After boasting their morale for bravely murdering an unarmed house, she won their trust first and then called for a toast. For indeed this toast they all cheered for, was in fact, an announcement for their death. She melded the strongest poison she could possibly find, in their wine. While all the house cheered for the death of House Stark, she also cheered but for House Frey, for she knew there annihilation was just around the corner, seconds later the house breathed their last, as the poison was quite strong to be melded in a drink. It took three houses to destroy one but when a girl, a teenager took her family’s revenge, all that rage, that helplessness she endured all those years was indeed jolted down in her and she waited. For she knew her time will come and when it did she maneuvered it beautifully with her grace. She vanquished the house completely from its existence as if it was never there. It was truly a shame for them all. A girl vanquished the whole house and tore it down completely, whereas three families couldn’t even manage to eradicate a single house. For truly these families deserved honor for destroying a great house and an ‘honored shame’ is all they could get.  
Indeed, when the deep roots of honor and loyalty are planted, strength instinctively finds it's way within.

  
The history witnessed two Stark girls, after losing everything they had, wiped out two great houses from their roots, only with their honor and dignity. Reminding all of those who once thought this great house was destroyed, it stands here with all of its prestige and honor. The North Remembers House Stark. Indeed, when a Wolf is invoked to its core, it becomes more ferocious than the Lion.

  
No matter how contentious this series was, but the show conveyed some serious message on the importance of women.  
Apart from real-life examples we see in our lives, this series subtly showed the young generation the potential of a woman, its status and strength through a fiction.

  
Two girls orphaned in their teenage, ripped apart from their family, left alone over a barrel on the society, managed to vanquish two great houses, the Boltans, and the Freys is indeed a prodigy in itself.

  
Without women, the whole human species would cease to exist. She is a daughter, a sister, a friend, a colleague, enters in the life of a man as a wife and helps him to continue his lineage, becomes a mother and then a grandmother providing her wisdom to the family. So as far as the status of men is concerned, women should be given the same importance as they are no indifferent to them.

  
If you want something ask men but if you want things to be done ask a woman.

  
A woman is a blessing for Men. Respect them.

### Game of Thrones — a Real TV Phenomenon

The TV shows and series could create real euphoria among the population. Since the oldest times there were shows that captured our attention in a more special way than others could.

No matter if we are talking about Since Fiction series, comedy series or drama, each of them has its own fans. I am sure than many of us rushed home to watch the next episode of our favorite TV show.

Some of them have their own fan clubs and they become an inspiration for theme parties and gatherings. It is like an addiction somehow.

One of the most popular TV series these days it seems to be Game of Thrones. How it became so popular? Did HBO owners ever believed in its great success?

These are just two questions to which I will try to give an answer in the following rows of this article. If you are interested on this topic you should continue your reading session.

### How did Game of Thrones start?

Everything [started in 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_%28season_1%29) and it was an average show with an average number of viewers. It received good reviews from film critics but it was far from being what it is today.

We can say that it won its fans in time. The main budget used was far from being a big one.

At that time no one believed that it will soon become a TV phenomenon and that will win a [best drama Emmy](https://www.dw.com/en/emmy-awards-2018-game-of-thrones-takes-home-top-drama-prize/a-45533265) prize. As I already said it was seen as an average story.

### Game of Thrones evolution

You may wonder, however, how everything changed. It seems that people today are drawn to such types of movies. The stories that reveal a bit of our history raised people interest.

The head and sword films where men defeated their enemies by swards and territories were conquered through endless wars capture the viewer attention. The imaginary characters such as wizards, giant birds, dragons, witches are also a very important part of these fiction TV series.

People imagination is awakening thanks to these characters. The importance and the great influence women had regarding the men’s world and how manipulative they could become is another important aspect brought to life in these movies.

One thing that really attracts men viewers is also the beauty of these women and their femininity mixed with a high level of intelligence. These TV stories have the perfect blend between roughness, tenderness, beauty, blood and fiction.

You might say that these things were also used in the past but the technology used in movies so the special effects will appear closer to reality and the high budgets used to create the perfect atmosphere had a great role in winning the viewers attention.

This is what the directors of “Game of Thrones” did in time. All you have to do is watch the first episode of the TV series and you will notice the difference between what it used to be and what it is today.

### How audience helped in development

Another secret used by the creators of this TV show was to listen to its audience. Even if you might not have similar ideas with them the viewers are the ones who will keep the show alive.

This means that you should adapt to their desires and surprise them all the time. This is exactly what they did. This is not a story where the main character always survives.

What stroked me when I first watched it was that fact that you fall in love with a character and it suddenly dies. You first feel that you have no reason to watch it anymore but you fall in love with another character.

Quite soon, the new character dies as well. The element of surprise is always present. In fact I believe that this is the first show where anyone could die and could be brought back to life when you don’t expect it.

After this description you could believe that it is too much violence in it. I will not disagree with this, but it is blended with so many other things such as eroticism, adventure, since fiction and many other things as well that will keep you in front of your TV or laptop for hours.

The [HBO channel](https://www.hbo.com/) has many other shows produced by them, but this one overcame everyone expectations regarding audience. Due to this aspect, the imagination of the directors was exploited at very high levels in order to preserve the standards and even increase them.

The actors grew along with their characters (if they were not suddenly killed). Some of them were affected in their real lives due to the roles that they played in the movie.

They were hated or loved for real because such TV phenomenon could create real passions among its viewers and sometimes they could not make the difference between what it is real and what is not.

### Conclusion

Even if you might think that people might get tired with it, it seems that they are more than interested about it today than they were at the beginning. Besides that, people who might never watched it (if there are any), once they start doing it they become instant fans.

We know that many TV shows had certain popularity that faded in time, such as “Friends”, “Grey’s anatomy”, “Dr. House”, “Seinfeld” and I could go on forever. None of them reached this level.

When it is going to end? I believe that the Game of Thrones fans don’t even think about this aspect. They hope that the directors’ source of ideas will never stop.

The dragons would also have grown way larger (feeding them son's of harpies and other Meereenese enemies of dany) and have scales strong enough to withstand scorpion bolts and arrows. They would also most likely drop a few more dragon eggs as well.

She also could have conquered some smaller houses and eventually the North (which had cause to destroy the lannisters anyway), made them bend the knee, and then had them take King's Landing for her.",gameofthrones

1157,"•Sansa and Aryas presence in the ending seasons was irritating all around. Pretty much from Aryas return to Winterfell and on, their presence just didn’t seem to have sensical purpose. It just felt weird and their actions annoying/petty/vapid. I think there may have been some plot holes going on with that. Arya in particular annoyed me. I can’t tell if it was how her character was written or if it was the actress. 

•I found most uncomfortable the notion of Jon submitting to Dany. As it would make no sense because the Jon that Dany loved was a Jon that was fighting for the North. Not a Jon who would submit. So it makes most logical sense to me that Jon stabbed her. I think it was actually rewarding it ended that way. 

•I would have preferred Jon ruled the 7 kingdoms.

•The name Bran the Broken is just really cringey to me.  That felt so corny and vapid. I was like wtffffff.

• Bran for some reason really did have an annoying presense and I don’t know why. The way he bothered me did not seem intentional. I think that maybe there was an issue with his acting or just the writing of the character.

•I did not like that Breanne and Jamie had sex. It just seemed stupid and unnecessary. Not even an interesting addition to story. Just like “oh yeah don’t forget to make sure every storyline gets turned to something we can masturbate to”

• In the ending seasons in particular I felt this awkwardness with characters we knew who were brought together for the first time (or for the first time since season 1). There was no “getting to no eachother phase” and there just seemed a lack of chemistry in an awkward way. For example Jon/Arya/Sansa. 

•I did not like Missandie. Her character was so dull and uninteresting. She could be removed entirely with little to no impact on story. I was glad her character died because she seemed to be present as nothing more than the token brown person.

• Cersei needed to die harder.

I gave careers to those who were in my house, such as smith, cook, maester, etc. Got some cheap swords to depict the medieval era.

1160,Did anyone watch season 8 episode 1 on HBO cable/network TV?

I am having some trouble find said video so if anyone could point me in the right direction that would be appreciated.,gameofthrones
1161,"I do not know whether this theory was voiced earlier, but when I watched the entire series, I constantly found interesting moments. I have a theory, and it, unlike many others, has a solid foundation from the facts that were in the series. Sorry for my english, i'm doing my best. I will try to put together a theory like a puzzle.

&amp;#x200B;

What do we know about wargs? They know how to move to other bodies after death. This was shown in 3x09. There was a scene when the varg was killed by John Snow, and at the time of his death he moved into the raven's body and tried to scratch John’s eyes. Also wargs can see the future. We were shown this repeatedly throughout in the series. Remember when Ricon and Bran saw a father in a dream and he stood in a crypt? Or when we were shown a flying dragon over the King's Landing. Also Bran dreamed that Winterfell flooded the sea. It was not long before Greyjoy captured Winterfell. There were many such scenes. Enumerate them all does not make sense, most importantly the facts.

&amp;#x200B;

The Old Raven is the Targaryen bastard. He has white hair and wears night watch clothes. Most likely he was sent to the wall in the past, as was Aemon. We do not know the reason. But we have a connection between the Night King and the Old Raven — signs. We will see the first such sign when the Night Watch reaches the fist of the first people. The Night King dismembered horses and made from their pieces a strange symbol resembling a circle. Then we see this sign around the tree. The place where Night King was created. The place where Old Raven sits is in the center of the tree. And now look at the Targaryen's coat of arms... It looks suspiciously like this symbol.

&amp;#x200B;

And now the theory itself. 6 season 5 series. The theory begins here. Old Raven and Bran are in the past. At the moment when the old raven kills the Night King, he moves into Bran’s body, and Bran takes Hodor’s body and accidentally fits into the timeline, getting into the past and leaving the message “Hodor”. After this scene Bran remains a “vegetable” to the final. This explains the change in character. In the 7x04 there is a dialogue between Bran and Mira. Bran tells her that he is no longer Bran, but Mira answers that Bran died in that cave. And his phrase in the last episode of season 8, “why do you think I did all this way?”, acquires a new meaning.

&amp;#x200B;

The old Raven wanted to return his throne, the throne of his ancestors. He has been waiting for a powerful warg for centuries. He was well prepared and set up all the events in order to eventually take his throne by inheritance. He successfully implemented his plan and sat on the throne. Well, more precisely, he became the ruler of 6 kingdoms.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that the above theory has the right to life. And it seems to me that even George Martin himself did not see this option to complete his story. This theory fully explains all the events starting from season 1 and covers a whole thousand holes in the entire series. Starting from having a raven on the poster of the first season, ending with strange signs similar to the Targaryen's coat of arms and that's why the Night King hunted for this ""Raven."" Oh, and a blade that has passed its way from season 1 to the final. He very carefully gave to Arya this blade. He knew about this blade and what she will kill the Night King with this blade.

&amp;#x200B;

The most interesting is that you do not need to change anything for this ending. It is enough to add a minute flashback after Tirion offers Bran to become king. To show the past of the old raven and how he arranged all the events that led him to this moment. (Your joke about re-filming the final season starts here.)",gameofthrones
1162,"Remember one year ago, back in May 2018, [Emilia Clarke once hinted HBO firmed multiple ending scenes for game of thrones season 8](https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/game-of-thrones-season-8-multiple-endings/) ""to avoid leaks"", and it was a big deal back then? Many people were exited, thought we can possibly got to see all of them.  
  
Just another pointless and disappointing thing, because:  
  
1. The ending was leaked before it was aired anyway, if multiple endings were true, HBO and the actors just wasted their time and budget.  
  
2. Now the show is completely over, no indication of these kind of scenes could be released. No one even mentioned them, I guess everyone, include HBO, *kinda forgot* about it again?  
  
3. There are two possibilities to explain this, either Emilia Clarke make this fact up, which is hard to believe and unnecessary, or HBO did do multiple endings but somehow choose not to release them. I expect these ""ghost scenes"" will remain a mystery for a very long time.",gameofthrones
1163,"So like a lot of people I have taken to re-watching the show after the final, and during this I noticed something pretty incredible which I haven't seen anyone else talk about. During the course of the series plenty of people get beheaded, but out of all of them three stick out; Theons beheading of Ser Rodrick, Robs beheading of Rickard Carstark, and lastly Jon's beheading of Janos Slynt. I think that all three of these moments where purposefully connected to create a season wide piece of storytelling.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout these scenes there are multiple connections between them but easily one of the strongest in the fact that Jon, Rob, and Theon are the only three boys raised to adulthood by Ned Stark and so all three of them are imbued with his teachings and morals and these scene show them using these morals in there own ways. This also goes on to show how each scene with each of it's characters is almost a metaphor for the characters as they enact these morals, such as Rob being shown to be to much like his father by doing what he thinks is right over what would be strategically beneficial to his war which ultimately leads to it being a mistake which becomes part of his undoing similarly to his own fathers downfall. It's the same with Jon as he enacts justice over Janos Slynt for his betrayal of Ned Stark without even knowing it while still adhering to the morals through beheading him for disobeying an order or how Theon is forced to make a hard line choice between Stark and Greyjoy bringing back up his identity crisis while also displaying his warped version of these morals as he follows the demand of his peers instead of the Stark teachings what he thinks is right.

&amp;#x200B;

This bring to possibly my favorite connection between all three of them which is the music, GoT uses musical storytelling a lot and so where ever its present there's almost always a weight to it. In all three of the beheadings scenes have the same piece of music run through them; singling them out and connecting them. The piece of music used is Pay The Iron Price which is primarily Theons/The Greyjoy theme but used here for its meaning 'to pay the iron price' such as Ser Rodrick, Rickard Carstark, and Janos Slynt do yet again connecting the scenes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now its entirely possible that this could all just be some big coincidence and they just happen'd to use the same music because its a the meaning of the song fit and so did the music, and the three stark raised men just happen'd to all have a beheading scene but the links between them and the nods to each of them I can't help but feel like they where purposefully put connected as three examples for each of the characters and their moral relation to the man who raised them. And even if its not they are still three great and often forgotten scenes with a fantastic piece of music behind them but I do believe that they where meant to be connected together

&amp;#x200B;

\-LOVED filming the knighting scene and thought it was very important for her character / the show / women and talks about it extensively (approx half of the interview) - this is part of a series of interviews with Emmy Award contenders and i'd suspect it would be the episode she's submitting so this makes sense.

\-Was happy with her ending, final line etc explains why (I actually really like her explanation)

\-Talks about how much she loves her character and how much everyone else loves their characters and then later about doing work on stuff that ""isn't on the page"" re women's stories (it would be cool if the interviewer expanded more on this as it's really interesting)

\-Said it would have broken her heart if Brienne had died

\-Talks about comforting Conleth in the Last Watch

\-Is diplomatic about the ending (starts about 13:50) - she is well known for having ""predicted"" Bran prior to the scripts coming out so she said she liked it but says she knew it was unconventional and it wouldn't please everyone.  
\-Discusses working with Nikolaj Coster Waldau

Maybe Arya, with her magical Valerian steel blade, doesn't require it to be clean and looked after, perhaps because it's a magical metal or something that doesn't rust. But it's entirely unforgivable for Greyworm, a highly trained soldier, to have such low regard for his weapon.

1176,"Miguel Sapochnik (Hardhome, Bob, Long Night, The Bells director) recently did a 2 hour interview about the battles in the final season and I ton of stuff and I was wondering if anyone who listened to the whole interview could provide a summary.

I've heard summaries of portions of it but not the whole thing. Here's what I've heard:

* He was ""visually policed"" on Hardhome. D&amp;D prefer a more classical shooting style. An example of this was (in the Gift) shooting Cersei and Tommen through prison bars which D&amp;D said was too self-conscious and a cut with Maester Aemon after his death.
* He says action scenes today are ""too designed."" He wants to immerse the actors.
* A lot of Hardhome was VFX. And their set was nothing like what was described in the script. Part of his success came in working with the extras.
* After the success of Hardhome, he was given more freedom in the future.
* 17 minute non battle opening for the Long Night: wanted to hold off the battle as long as possible due to battle fatigue and it becoming a remix of every battle they've done.
* He wanted to kill everyone in the Long Night but he wasn't allowed to. They were saving stuff for the Bells, kinda.
* He wanted Jorah to die in the beginning of the Long Night. He wanted the horse charge to be ruthless so people would know all bets were off.
* It doesn't matter how many people you kill. It doesn't matter if you've tuned out. He tried to focus on the characters.
* The sequence was originally much bigger then they filmed and contained a ton of awesome stuff that people would've loved: The specific example he gives is 50 direwolves (he probably means Nymeria's wolfpack). He says that does not make a good story.
* Hodor wight was supposed to happen.
* He crafted a complete story for every character in the Long Night and there is like 20 extra minutes of footage. He gave the actors a story, even if a lot of that ended up off screen so it wouldn't just be choreography.
* There was initially a ""very long"" fight sequence with the Night King but when discussing why it was cut he said at the end of this long battle do I really care wether the Night King can do some ""fancy staff moves"" or engage Bran in character (the Theon, Bran, NK standoff).
* Speaking of Bran, apparently he was warging into animals around the battlefield to help them out.
* Mantra for the Long Night: ""the final battle between good and evil."" the bells: ""what have we become"". Those mantras informed the scenes.
* D&amp;D's mantra for shooting was ""it's gonna kill us but it's gonna be great."" They were ruthless in trying to get stuff they wanted but they still had physical and budget constraints. Supposedly, the went over budget but that's a rumor.

I know he also talked about the Bells and the finale but I didn't listen to that part. Anyone else got a TL;DR for the stuff I missed?

**Edit:** Here's the interview:  [https://soundcloud.com/user-445966404/game-of-thrones-director-miguel-sapochnik](https://soundcloud.com/user-445966404/game-of-thrones-director-miguel-sapochnik)",gameofthrones
1177,"Cersei’s I should say. Because I will admit, I hate that Jaime was there and simply didn’t leave her, and that Arya didn’t at least attempt to harm her, but now that I think about it, the more I think the prophecy was fulfilled. 

In the books, Cersei’s prophecy is that she will have three children and her husband will be the king and he shall have 17. Granted show maggy says 20 but it could’ve been rounding. Anyway, these three children will rule as kings and queens (makes more sense in the books) and she will outlive them. And she shall be queen until a younger and more beautiful queen comes to take all she holds dear and cast her down. And once her tears consume her, “the Valonqar shall wrap his hands around your pale white throat and choke the life from you.” 

Now, the reason I find it poetic is for a few reasons:

1. Valonqar. In the book, Cersei’s hatred of Tyrion is magnified not only because Tyrion killed their mom to live but because she asks a Septa what the word means and is told it means little brother. Only the problem is, as maester aemon explains, there isn’t a gender system in Valyrian, as Valyrian is the language of the dragons and dragons are gender fluid magical beings. But the common tongue is male dominant, so “little sibling” becomes “little brother.” 

And Dany is the littlest child of Aerys. And a further reason why Aerys went mad was because after Rhaegar, he and his wife had a string of miscarriages and stillbirths, or children who didn’t live more than a few months. So he locked Rhaella away and decreed two septas would share her bed each night. In addition, he tortured a wet nurse who he thought poisoned one of his children and murdered her family. And when Viserys was born after he made a pilgrimage, he had all the gifts the lords sent burned, never let Rhaella be alone with him, and made the royal taster drink from the wet nurses nipples. Sorry I know this is off topic but nice fact. 

2. Maggy made a mistake, as did the septa. Like I said, Valyrian is a gender fluid language, so “my mother and father” would become “my parents.”  With both, it’s a second language, so errors are bound to happen. 

3. Cersei was choked. Not in the literal but more metaphorical sense. After all, even if she somehow survived the initial cave in, she would’ve certainly suffocated to death. 

In addition, I should mention that in the books at least, prophecies and futures aren’t stated outright because that’s not how powers work. With jojen, he isn’t just told in his sleep “Theon Greyjoy wants to kill y’all and he’s gonna do it once AGT finishes” but has to interpret it. Meanwhile, Melisandre sucks not because she’s a fraud but because she gets visions in the flames and has to figure them out: she might get a woman who looks like Arya but if she’s never met Arya how can she truly know? 

Even jojen states that he simply dreams of symbolic events.

For example: “I dreamed of the man who came today, the one they call Reek. You and your brother lay dead at his feet, and he was skinning off your faces with a long red blade.” Though we as readers know that he’s dreaming of Theon burning the bodies of those farm boys. Obviously he might not. 

Which brings me to my last point. 

4. Maggy wasn’t lying and that was exactly what she saw. Which makes the whole circumstance ten times more tragic as she didn’t simply know everything. Like I said, prophecies in GOT aren’t matter of fact knowledge. it’s like being given a painting of a few differently covered lines and being told to analyze how it symbolizes corporate greed. Maggy probably didn’t see Dany having a temper tantrum but rather just saw an older version of Cersei crying somewhere while hands came out from the darkness and choked her. 

So this is why I find it poetic. Thoughts?",gameofthrones
1178,"Like most cases in Westeros (and in the real world), Targaryen (or rather, Valyrian) names ending with ""-a"" are more often than not female. For example, Visenya, Rhaenyra and Rhaella.

On the other hand, names ending with ""-on"" are male, the examples being Aegon, Aemon, Daemon and Daeron.

The names ending with ""-or"" or ""-ar"" are also male, like Maegor, Baelor or Maekar.

The problem is with the names ending with ""-ys"", which seem to be gender neutral. For example, Jaeherys, Viserys and Aerys are male, but Rhaenys and Daenerys are female.

Yet 6 seasons later in the same city now it’s common knowledge and Tyrion knows it will happen when he hasn’t been there in years. The small folk also know. Davos grew up in Kings Landing. He would know if the bells meant surrender. I guess the writers wouldn’t. 

This is yet again another in the long list of mistakes they’ve made like saying Kings Landing has a million people in it when it previously had half that amount or Jaime having short hair and the wrong Kingsguard armor in the kingslayer flashback.

1180,"I know that there has been a growing feeling among the Great Houses of Westeros to think not only for themselves, but also for the overall welfare of the ""Realm"". This particular word, though, can be interpreted in many different ways.

The Lords of Westeros probably haven't forgotten that their families were Kings of their specific regions for thousands of years before the Targaryens came. And even if they have been shunted to the title of ""Lord"" from ""King"", it has been only for three hundred years.

They bent the knee to Aegon and his dragons. And even after Aegon was dead, they remained under the Targaryen rule because of fear of the dragons and the Iron Throne.

Even after the dragons went extinct, it was the fear of the Iron Throne that kept them under the rule. After the Targaryens were gone, it was still the fear of the Iron Throne that kept the Seven Kingdoms united. Also, the fact that Robert Baratheon was the son of Aerys Targaryen's cousin helped the succession.

After the finale however, I don't understand *why* the Lords of Westeros elect a new King to rule over the Seven (now Six) Kingdoms? After all, there is no Iron Throne, there is no Red Keep, King's Landing is in ruins, and the King they elected doesn't even belong to the line of the Targaryens.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally really liked the book version of her and found the show's version incredibly obnoxious, despite the fact that Rose Leslie is an amazing actor. In the books, she appeared to be much more fleshed out: having moments of genuine vulnerability and lamenting the slow death of the giant race, and concerned for the fate of her people. In the show everything she did or said appeared to be completely dependent on how she felt about Jon, to the point where she was willing to go with him when he returned to the Night's Watch. Moreover, in the fourth season her only character motivation was ""woman scorned"", to the point where she even had to make a little speech to the Wildlings about the consequences of one of them killing Jon before she had a chance to murder and/or castrate him.

&amp;#x200B;

Show Ygritte, in my opinion, is a solid representation of the big problems the show had all the way until the end with the writers' version of strong female protagonists: constantly belittling and emasculating men who arguably don't deserve to be belittled or emasculated, while the men never stand up for themselves.",gameofthrones
1184,"As we all know, The Battle of Winterfell was considered  kind of a letdown. Not enough deaths, illogical scenes, etc.... Well hopefully I can give my remake to y’all...

Just so you know I am a huge fan of GoT and ASOIAF, but I am by no means a filmmaker or director. I also am not suggesting an actual remake to the show, but I am just giving hypothetical scenarios to the scene. 

For starters, the scene that was the most odd to me in the Battle of Winterfell (I’ll just call it BoW from now on) was the fact that on the outskirts of Winterfell, Jon just sat there as the Night King raised up his army once again. If we consider the sheer hatred and annoyance Jon had against the NK for so long, it would only be logical for him to make a mad dash at the NK so he couldn’t raise his army up in time. Then, an epic sword fight would ensue between Jon and the NK (remember, the last proper sword fight against a WW was a long time ago). Eventually, after a few cuts and slashes by the NK, Jon finally disarms the NK. As he is making the final slash to kill the NK once and for all, we see the NK flick his wrist upwards and suddenly multiple dead wights shield the NK from Jon’s sword. (That needs some more work, sorry about that. But I hope y’all get the point). From then on, Jon can be slashing through the Wights and dead people as the NK picks up his sword and heads towards the tree to meet Bran. 

The next thing I would change is Arya’s assassination against the NK. It’s pretty simple and it’s also a pretty common revision, but I would like it if we saw one of the wight generals step forward and get closer and closer towards the NK. As we see the general stepping (ideally the camera can focus on his footsteps) the camera pans upward to see that Arya is taking her Wight face off. Then, the generals realize what’s happening and race after her. The NK hears this and turns around, choking Arya. Then the epic dagger switch that we all know and love occurs. 

That’s all I’ve got for now, but if anyone has any other hypothetical scenarios I would love to hear it.",gameofthrones

1186,"Starting from episode 3: The battleplan, the trebuchets in front of the melee troops, and cavalry charge in first, is in the books.  It's mentioned a couple of times in the books, book 4 I believe.  That is considered to be the best battleplan in Westerosi.  It's more of a they have no clue how to beat the undead, so they just go with the best battleplan that they know of.  They really did believe that there was no way they can beat the undead.  I think the cavalry charge was altered to make it look better cinematically.  And it does look pretty damn cool.  

  There is a lot, A LOT, going on in episode 3.  It really is difficult to watch more than 15 minutes at a time, without getting lost.  Can you tell me who saved who in that episode?  Can you tell me who was defending the walls of Winterfell as the undead horde climbed the walls?  It's actually pretty cool to think about who wound up on the walls of Winterfell.  I'll give you a hint, there weren't any Starks there. 

  Jon Snow is a badass.  Watch closely what he does during the battle.  I think Tormund says it best, ""He keeps fighting.  He keeps fighting.  Only a madman or a King would do that.""  I think people are getting a little hung up that he didn't didn't fight the Night King one-on-one, but that'd be the stereotypical result.  He did one v. one the Night King on a frickin' dragon.  

  The Night King almost won.  There was nothing standing between the Night King and Bran.  That would have meant the end for everyone.  The Night King was a symbol of total destruction.  It came that close to it.  Arya is ""OP.""  She was trained by the best swordsman to ever live, in addition to the faceless men.  She really is the correct choice to kill the Night King.  I think we can ignore that she appears to fly out of nowhere.  Another cinematic decision.

  Episode 5:  People have been complaining that Daenerys went mad without reason.  That's the thing about going mad, it doesn't really need a reason.  I'll go a step further and say she might not have even been mad.  All of Tyrion's advice had been causing her to fail.  In her head, she was likely thinking that since Tyrion told her to stop when the bell rung, she shouldn't do that.  She also probably thought that since she wasn't loved, she must be feared.  She's the Heart-Broken Queen.  Also, that is how her ancestors won Westeros, by burning cities to the ground.  Were they considered 'mad'?

  Episode 6:  I thought this episode was great, right until Jon stabbed Dany.  After that it got a bit surreal.  On my first viewing, at almost looked like satire of Game of Thrones.  On a second view, it does make sense that things would turn out that way after Jon killed Dany.  Yes, the dialogue wasn't that good, but can you blame D&amp;D if they didn't have the source material to go off of?  They aren't as good of writers as GRRM, but they sure made that last season look beautiful, terrifyingly beautiful.  Should Jon have stabbed Dany?  I say no, but Westeros did end up in mostly good hands in that ending.  

   Let's analyze who is at the small council meeting.  Tyrion's there.  He's smart, he has experience leading, He's a Lannister, but he's not like his brother or sister.  Then you have Davos.  I can't think of a better master of ships.  Then there's Brienne, a knight who beat the Hound in single combat.  An honorable lady.  There's Samwell Tarly, who rivals Tyrion of intelligence.  So it ends up with 3 honorable people on the council, 1 neutral, and 1 not-so-honorable person.  Now Bronn is quick to give money for food.  That's a good sign.  I think he has shown throughout the show, that he's not necessarily dishonorable.  That small council is efficient, and has someone who won't agree with everything that's said.  It's good for leaders to have people who put up disagreements.  Tyrion says, ""I brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a bar.""  Everyone else at the table says, ""Who let this Jackass in here?""

1187,"My front page has been filled, for weeks, with posts complaining about this show.  From this subreddit and freefolk. 

I enjoyed season 8.  I thought it was a great conclusion. 

Honestly there are only a couple things that bugged me.  My biggest concern was that Grey Worm never got any punishment for all the war crimes he and the rest of the Unsullied committed.  

I was expecting Jon vs. Ice Dragon... and then I was expecting Jon vs. Fire Dragon.. so that was a little upsetting. 

It’s kind of lame that Drogon just flew away but I do think it makes sense.  Jon is a Targaryen so I don’t think Drogon would have attacked him. 

I knew Dani was going to burn everyone I just really wish she didn’t.  My ideal ending would have been Jon and Dani ruling together.

1205,"Before season 8, I really liked Arya, as a character, but I wasn't a big fan of her story. I thought her storyline was going no where and was simply in the show because she was a popular character that GRRM couldn't kill unless he wanted a divorce. But after season 8, I must say that I really loved how they wrapped her story and how everything make sense.

In my opinion, Arya's storyline was about Death and Life. At a really young age, she witnessed terrible things. She saw her father loosing his head, she saw the red wedding. So, she chose a path of violence, of vengeance, of Death. She joined a cult of assassin with no emotion who serve the God of Death because that's what she was pursuing. But then, she turned her back on them and returned home. She turned her back on Death. When she plunged her dagger in The Night King, she defeated Death. That was a massive step in the path of Life, but not the last. The last step came in Kings Landing. Arya had to go there, she needed that conversation with The Hound. She needed to abandon her path of vengeance, and she did. She chose Life, for good. That's why she decided to help the citizens escaping Kings Landing. She abandonned Death entirely and decided to fight for Life. That concluded her storyline. She defeated Death, she abadonned her search for vengeance. She's now a strong woman capable of fighting for the right reasons. I think season 8 wrapped her storyline perfectly.

Now, I know what's coming in the comments. I know they decided that Arya would kill The Night King around S6-7, so that wasn't planned from the beginning. But I still think they took the right decision. As I said before, killing The Night King was a really important step in Arya's storyline. It make perfect sense that she would kill Death after spending 6 seasons wrongfully pursuiting it.

But also, it makes perfect sense if we add the Lord of Light in the conversation. The Lord of Light was fighting against Death, and who represented the Lord of Light? Melisandre. The scene she had with Arya in S3 makes perfect sense knowing that Arya would kill The Night King (even if it wasn't determined at that point, I know, I know). Also, three men were helped by the Lord of Light in the story. Beric (resurrected 6 times), The Hound (won his trial against Beric/LoL and maybe resurrected) and Jon (resurrected once). Three men that had significant impact on Arya's story. Beric &amp; The Hound saved Arya at Winterfell and Jon is the reason she was at Winterfell for the fight, we all know that.

But also, Beric spent some times with Arya in S3. What were they talking about ? Death. It's also because of him and the BWB that Arya was taken by The Hound, instead of rejoining her family and get murdered. The Hound also spent a lot of times with Arya. He fought for her. He protected her. He showed her how to survive alone. But he also showed her that mercy is a thing. One thing that helped her leaving the path of Death. (Her mercy for Lady Crane) Jon gave Needle to Arya, which basically pushes her to start training and become a good fighter. Needle is also what stopped Arya from going forward in the path of Death. She was supposed to become No One, forget her identity, but she wasn't able to throw away Needle. Needle is what kept her in the right path. It's what reminded her of her home and who she is.

So, I know that Arya killing The Night King wasn't something they always knew would happen, but I think it was the right decision. They managed to surprise us while not throwing away the narrative of the past seasons. Even better, everything lines up almost perfectly within Arya's storyline. Almost everyone who had an impact on her story were related to the Night King and Death. It wasn't simply a shocking moment just for the sake of shocking the viewers. It was something that needed to happen for the sake of Arya's storyline and something that totally makes sense in the story.

Sorry for the wall of text, just wanted to share my opinion on this. I'm seeing a lot of people asking what was the point of Arya becoming a faceless man. In my opinion, it wasn't to learn a cool ability. It had nothing to do with the ability of changing faces. It was her going down a path of vengeance, of Death. She used her ability once to avenge her family, but then she left that path, so it makes sense to not see Arya use that ability anymore.

TL;DR: Season 8 made Arya's storyline a lot more interesting and wrapped it up perfectly. Killing the Night King was also needed for her storyline.",gameofthrones
1206,"If you were to watch an edit of the series through the perspective of the Starks only, cutting out every scene that doesn’t feature a Stark, a few interesting things happen:

(Note: this includes only Ned, Catelyn, Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon — excluding Jon)

-Littlefinger becomes the overarching villain of the story. He is the one who destroys their family and it is only when the three surviving Starks come together again that they are able to defeat him.

-The White Walkers are only introduced in season 6, making Bran's storyline feel like it's actually building up to something huge, since he is our conduit into the Long Night, instead of Jon. Also, the late game appearance of the White Walkers makes it far less anti-climactic for them to lose in one battle and be killed by Arya.

-Jon is to the story what Bard is to the Hobbit. He's absent for most of the story, but is an archetypal hero figure that appears in the third act to help out the main characters. Also, his lineage isn't built up, so there's less disappointment when it goes nowhere.

-Dany is far more untrustworthy when she appears in the final act. The Starks have finally taken back their independence and now they must bow to a foreigner because she has dragons.",gameofthrones
1207,"I'm not disagreeing that the last two seasons were lackluster. What they were was essentially feature films with massive amount of logistics- each episode was more similar to a movie than a TV show in terms of production. I'm sure they also had a corporate team with no idea of production breathing down their throats, do this, do that, make Bronn a lord, whatever. I feel like they were rushed- we saw how good the show was at first, then it turned into massive workload. Seven hour long episodes in a year with a ton of special effects is an insane schedule. 

Even if the writing sucked, everything else was awesome and I think the last two seasons still deserve praise for things like costume, cinematography and music. 

Idk. It just makes me sad people were like ""it all sucked"" when really it still had a lot going for it. I wasn't happy with the script either, but the fact they did so much in so little time is still praiseworthy.",gameofthrones

1210,"-The Battle of Winterfell still happens, however the women and children are kept in the great hall instead of the crypt.
-Actual military tactics are used, better placement of the Unsullied, to hold the front line, as the vanguard, not to mention the catapults are in the far back, and fired more than once.

-A secondary fire trench or moat is created for if (when) the undead break through the primary one, this allows more time to fall back if the first is breached. There will also be a tertiary one around the great hall in case all troops must fall back to allow as much time as possible.

-Now the question is how will everyone escape once falling back to the great hall, this is simple. Remember back to season two when Maester Luwin tells Theon there are old escape routes? Well guess what, one of them is located in the great hall, but where does that tunnel lead? It leads to a nearby river that ultimately leads to White Harbor, where there are... you guessed it SHIPS. The undead have been shown to not cross water.

-After both of the remaining fire trenches are broken the undead follow the survivors trying to escape. The armies end up taking a huge hit, but are still at roughly forty percent, which actually shows a very significant loss of life. But where do these ships take our survivors. The ships set sail for the Iron Islands, which Yara took so they have a place to fall back.

-Also think about it history has a way of repeating itself if you forget it... What are House Greyjoy's words? ""What Is Dead May Never Die"" because.. you guessed it this happened before. Or better yet what if Bran influenced that as well? What if he went into the past like he did with Hodor and Created the words, as a sign of what to do... also what if the long night was just bran spreading stories of that night?

-Anyway not wanting to lose the entirety of the people to the undead, and still wanting the throne, the survivors now head to Kings Landing. Here they will set up a final defense for the living, and to once and for all eradicate the scourge of the undead.

-Cersei doesn't believe the undead army is actually coming and turns them away... Because of this Daenerys, isn't going to allow countless people to be killed just because Cersei will not see reason... Daenerys gives Cersei a final choice to surrender or die. Cersei doesn't surrender, so Daenerys flies Drogon to the Iron Keep and burns it down with Cersei still inside. This causes most of Kings Landing to burn as well because of a wildfire chain reaction. Knowing the undead army is still traveling South they get the remaining people in Kings Landing to the back of the city in a more secure area.

-Here is where more military tactics are put to good use. knowing what worked to keep the undead at bay in Winterfell, the defense of Kings Landing is set up. After the Battle of Winterfell it is known that fighting the undead head on is a BAD IDEA. A plan is put into place for some instances of Guerrilla Warfare. The reasoning: who needs to fight honorably against the undead.

-When the undead army arrives, even with the planning, and the fact that Kings Landing is on a peninsula, thus easier to defend, there is not much success being had. This is due to the fact that the armies too such a hit, not to mention Rhaegal still has not healed from the severe wounds from the Battle of Winterfell. Viserion is wreaking havoc on Kings Landing at the command of the Night King, who is of course commanding this while riding him.

-Meanwhile Daenerys isn't taking the unintentional killing of hundreds of thousands at Kings Landing very well at all... and Drogon is beside her not helping the fight. Jon knows they need Drogon to fight Viserion and the Night King or everyone will die. Jon pleads with Danerys to fly Drogon and fight, but she is too distraught, that at her hands countless people had died. Jon knows that there is no hope of talking reason to Daenerys. At this point all she is saying is ""I burned them all"" over and over, and she cannot be reached with reason. Jon knows what must be done, but is reluctant to do so, because she is the woman he loves. Jon embraces Daenerys, and she continues to only utter the same phrase ""I burned them all"" He pulls out his dagger, and says ""You will always be my Queen."" Jon then stabs Daenerys in the heart, and even while dying she just keeps repeating that she burned them all over and over, until the light finally leaves her eyes. Drogon walks to Daenerys and nuzzles his mother one last time. Afterward Drogon roars in anguish, and spews fire into the sky mourning her. Drogon knows what Jon did, but also realizes it was a kindness because his mother is no longer in pain. Jon now communicates to Drogon that they must destroy the Night King. Drogon solemnly bows his head to allow Jon to join him in what is sure to be his final battle, an attempt to defeat the true enemy of Death. At the moment when hope is all but lost it cuts to a sky battle between Drogon and Viserion, Jon, and the Night King. Tere are multiple flybys by both Drogon and Viserion of breath attacks, and each one trying to at the time of passing claw the other out of the air. One of the flybys the claws interlock and all four start plummeting to the ground. Drogon and Viserion are biting at each other during this free fall, trying to get the advantage on the other. As this is happening Jon and the Night King are clashing blades. Everything hangs in the balance with the free fall that is taking place. An opportunity presents itself to Jon as he Counter Ripostes the Night King's last thrust. Jon stabs the Night king int he heart, which happens to be where the Night King was stabbed , and turned into what he is. After the final thrust from Jon Viserion shatters in Drogon's talons, thus allowing Drogon to pull up mere meters from the ground. All of the wights in the area are lifeless, and the remaining White Walkers are all shattered. The Night King continues to free fall towards the ground. Upon impact with the earth the Night King also shatters. The long night was finally over.",gameofthrones
1211,"**Warning: SPOILERS for the books (especially the Meereen storyline)**

So, i know this was like, two seasons past, but the Battle of Meereen in the show was nothing like i expected it to be.

While i was (and still am) waiting for 'The Winds of Winter', i looked for various theories on both 'A Song of Ice and Fire' and 'Game of Thrones'. In that search, i found a site (blog?) with different analyses on different topics, all centered around the world of ASoIaF. One of these essay series is centered around the plotline in Meereen, from the arrival of the different major and minor characters in Meereen itself, to the tensions and arising between the three factions inside and outside of Meereen (those three being Daenerys's faction, the Sons of the Harpy, and the Yunkish opposition). The essay series, which the author BryndenBFish titled 'The Dragon Dawn', analyzed the the plotline preceeding the battle, as well as the most likely events that would transpire in the actual battle itself.

The essay has 6 parts, the first of which is linked below, to anyone considering reading it: [https://warsandpoliticsoficeandfire.wordpress.com/2014/02/21/a-dragon-dawn-a-complete-analysis-of-the-upcoming-battle-of-fire-part-1-the-gathering-storm/](https://warsandpoliticsoficeandfire.wordpress.com/2014/02/21/a-dragon-dawn-a-complete-analysis-of-the-upcoming-battle-of-fire-part-1-the-gathering-storm/)

1212,"During my rewatch of season 6 I can’t help but feel I’m watching a Meereen version of season 7-8. 

Although Dany wasn’t present in Meereen for most of season 6, Tyrion’s plots to keep the peace and Dany’s throne secure ends in absolute defeat. The only reason the slavers did not take back the city is because Dany showed up on the back of Drogon and burnt down every ship killing thousands. This time no one murdered her after though. 

Obviously the circumstances where entirely different but the similarities are there. 

Also now realizing that Dany would have never allowed Tyrion to make a deal where slavery existed for 7 more years. Which wasn’t a bad diplomatic solution for the difficult situation they faced. It was Tyrion’s lack of understanding his enemies that did him in. Also similar to seasons 7 &amp; 8, expect he underestimated them.",gameofthrones

1214,Was it for personal growth? To end a plot line?,gameofthrones
1215,"So just to clarify, this is actually a theory I had about how episode 6 was going to end just after i’d watched episode 5, but it didn’t happen so now i’m just gonna chuck it out here for anyone who wants to read it. 

So picture this, pretty much the same thing happens all throughout the episode, everybody gathers at kings landing to pay tribute to their new queen (the show has had a fair few biblical references already, so this theory adds a few more), this is similar to the wise men coming to see jesus, but not a baby, just a queen instead of a king, similar but not that much. 

Then with every single person of importance all in kings landing at the same time all bending the knee to mother of dragons breaker of chains blah blah, remember the cats of wildfire that were slowly sorta blowing up, like not too much but noticeably in episode 5? Imagine if that every single drop of it that the mad king placed, to literally nuke the city as Jamie tells Brienne in the bath scene, well imagine if all of danny’s destruction sets it all off and causes a chain reaction and literally nukes the city killing everyone. This means the mad king’s plan comes full circle. This would also leave Jon and Dany alive as both aren’t susceptible to fire, or at least I assume Jon isn’t but this is never confirmed in the show. They rise up as adam and eve of this new world and after all this time dany gets her crown and throne, but no people go lead or be queen for, which is sorta what she wanted, but backwards. She wanted people to love her not Jon, but if there are no people then nobody will contest her right to the throne and everyone (Jon) will love her. 

Then maybe at the end show a wildling running away from a white walker (s1 e1) and just leave it as exactly that kind of cliffhanger? This would’ve been more impactful with a lot more deaths imo, either way we didn’t get this so it doesn’t matter, would be cool if we did though!",gameofthrones
1216,"As I am rewatching, surprisingly enough I think Jon and Sansa’s was by far the best. 

It was the first stark reunion we saw and It was between the two Starks that had the weakest relationship of the siblings. Especially in the books, where Sansa was actually cruel towards Jon. 

The amount of love and emotion in the scene is a true testament to the extreme trauma these two have experience.  Sansa has just escaped the worst abuse she has encountered and Jon was literally just been murdered by his own men.

1217,"Eight seasons. Eight seasons in less than a month. That was my goal, and at the time of writing this review, I accomplished that goal about ten minutes ago. So what can be said about Game of Thrones that hasn’t been said before? I’m sure that much of what I have to say has been said before, but alas, I will continue with my review. 

I’ll be honest when I say that I never planned on watching Game of Thrones. Sure what I had heard sounded interesting enough, but not interesting enough to make me sit down and watch the show. Then the last two episodes of the series hit, and the collective buzz from the internet as well as some friends convinced me that there was something to this show, and so, I sat and watched. 

The show’s strongest point lied with its characters. Characters with separate agendas, all writing one soliloquy of chaos. That was what I loved the most. The characters. Many characters I loved and many I loved to hate, and I did not feel that there was a character that should have gotten a different ending. I suppose that would be because my favorite characters were left on the board at the end of the series. Jon, Tyrion, Arya, I felt that they got the ending that suited them best and the same goes for the character’s that I was not rooting for. Jamie, Cersei, Daenerys, and many others got the ending that suited them. I suppose the exception to this would be Ned Stark, who deserved a better fate. 

At the moment, I’m faced with an unfamiliar problem. I can’t find anything glaringly bad about the show. Sure it could be a drag at some points, but I felt that was all in service to the overall story. I know that many people agree that the show started to go downhill after season four, but I found the show to be overall consistent with its storytelling. Sure the battles got bigger, the locations more extravagant, but the storytelling always felt the same. I wouldn’t say that it was a bad thing. Overall I would say that while the show met my expectations, it never exceeded them. What was good was good and what was just okay was just okay. It was still an overall interesting story with some good moments. 

Ultimately I would describe Game of Thrones as big. It’s world building and many characters make it big. There is a lot more I could say, and I may write up other posts talking about what I thought about certain characters. For the moment I’ll end things with my rating for the show.  7/10.",gameofthrones

See Jon go from wide eyed dreamer to hardened battle hero. Even smaller characters like seeing Oberon or Hot Pie as they existed over the series. It was an enchanting series (regardless of your opinion of the later seasons), but each character could only have limited screen time each episode, so I feel it would be interesting to see a single characters progression as it happened. Yes there would be a bit of crossover, but it could be cool. Just throwing an idea out there and seeing what happens.",gameofthrones

1226,"Without changing the storyline:

1. Direct combat between Night king and Jon Snow 
2. More about the struggle between Jon Dnow and Daenerys. Otherwise it feels like Jon did nothing.
3. After last war, a deeper discussion in the council would have given better explanation for lots of things. Eg: why Jon was not made king. He was not discussed, or even appeared, at the council. Everything happened off screen.  He was a war hero. He saved everybody. He was a good man and the true heir. But he wasn't even acknowledged. Directly Tyrion tells him in jail that he is being sent to Night's Watch as a compromise. 
4. Why do we see only Tyrion talking at the council? Nobody else speaks at all.
4. Speaking of Night's Watch, what is it now? What is its role? 
6. One scene of Bran warging and seeing drogon in some forest, living on his own, the last of his kind would have been good.
6. Something about how Essos is faring since Daenerys left and died. What happens with Daario Naharis? 
7. More about Sansa as queen and Arya becoming a wanderer.
8. How was Bran's small council chosen? Why is Bronn included? 
9. Last but, for me, the most important, more on the tragic love story of Rheager Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. How they met, why they married in secret.

I think that is interesting because the seeds that she could eventually go mad were already planted way back in S3 but we the viewers chose to ignore them.

In my experience, people became fans of GoT not for the plot, but for the ""plot"", if you know what I mean ;)

Because, well, I wasn't shocked.",gameofthrones
1231,"Since the basic point of this post was lost, here's an edit:
Perhaps the sudden shift that everybody sees in Daenerys was not the writers' failure, but actually a success. This is what they intended from the start. To lead everybody on and then drop them down suddenly.

Original post: 
So many fans are angry about Daenerys going full Targaryen on King's Landing. They feel she was a merciful ruler for 7 seasons. The shift to madness in S8 seems sudden to them. They feel it was done only for shock value.

Do you think these fans fell into a deliberate series-wide trap set up by the writers of the show? They made the fans fall in love with her but hid her cruelty under subtlety so that it was not obvious on the surface. Then by revealing her real nature, they basically killed the most favourite character of the show in a highly vivid manner.

Isn't that what has happened in the entire series with all favourite characters who died?",gameofthrones
1232,"“How I think Game of Thrones should have ended.

Rather than Daenerys just snapping and attacking the city, Cersei should have set a trap. After the bells rang, thinking this might end in a peaceful resolution, arrows start flying at Drogon and Daenerys, as Cersei has hid scorpions on rooftops scattered throughout the city. An arrow misses her, another grazes Drogon, seeing her last dragon nearly taken out enrages her and she starts attacking the rooftops on Kings Landing as arrows fly at from all directions (Not necessarily targeting civilians, but not taking care as to avoid them). This would give her rampage more motivation, as she embraces her inner dragon, however is somewhat able to justify her actions in her mind.

And it’s Nymeria that shows up for Arya, instead of a white horse (whether she’s real, or just an illusion is open for interpretaton). Rather than being killed, Cersei gets captured by the Unsullied, Jaime dies defending her, while trying to get her out of the castle. 

The next episode, Tyrion is saddened and horrified at the sight of Kings Landing. He finds Daenerys in the throne room, he confronts her about the slaughter, she justifies her actions although is slightly saddened it came to this. She is more so in awe of the Iron Throne. She forgives Tyrion of his treason, and he reluctantly accepts her justification, knowing she now has his sister in her custody. 

Daenerys plans to make an example out of Cersei and invites all the Nobles of Westeros to take part in her trial and execution. During the trial, Tyrion begs Daenerys to allow her to have the baby before her execution, she refuses. In private, Tyrion presses the matter, stating that his sister is evil, but her unborn child is innocent. Daenerys explains, how after her father’s murder she survived and came back to reclaim her father’s throne with blood and fire, and she will not allow another lion into this world to take back it’s mother’s throne. 

Tyrion, now completely losing faith in Daenerys tries to resign, however she refuses. This being the first time she’s willing to kill an innocent for her own personal gain, and is in a sense enslaving Tyrion. Tyrion goes to see Cersei, she gets her Emmy winning monologue in, then breaks down and starts to cry about the prospects of a public execution. Tyrion, in a mercy killing, strangles Cersei.

Daenerys, enraged, imprisons Tyrion and sentences him to death, in his sister’s place, as a message to anyone refuses to bend the knee and help build her vision of a better world. Daenerys makes her victory speech, in front all of Westeros how she is the last Dragon, and how she will liberate the world, and how all of her enemies will die screaming. Tyrion convinces Jon that she’s a threat to his family.

Daenerys, has now crowned herself as Queen, is sitting in the iron throne. Jon speaks with her, Daenerys and Jon talk about their childhoods, dreams, journeys, we begin to remember why we fell in love with Daenerys and how her heart is not completely gone, but has been corrupted by the vision of the world she wants to build.  He kills her, same thing Drogon comes in and is pissed, the loud sounds alert the Unsullied and Northern men, including Grey Worm, who all witness as Drogon melts the Irone Throne and carries her body away. Grey Worm tries to kill Jon, the Northern Men and Unsullied fight in the throne room, leading to a stale mate. 

Jon is brought before the Lords and Ladies of Westeros. Daenerys’s followers are on the brink of declaring war on Jon’s supporters. He agrees to die to keep the peace. He awaits his execution, when Arya, using her faceless man techniques, sneaks in and helps smuggle Jon across the wall. The Unsullied and Dothraki want to search every inch of the country to find him, however Ser Davos convinces Grey Worm there time would be better spent living out the legacy Daenerys started of freeing slaves. After speaking with Davos, Grey Worm lets Tyrion free, as a mercy, he goes on to say that Tyrion is the “worst man he’s ever known,” followed by “I make joke.”

Bran is offered King, but turns it down, and reminds them of a history before they bowed to the dragons. The Lords and Ladies decide, rather than select a King or Queen, to all break off and go independent, as they were before the Targaryen conquest. Sansa, still becomes Queen of the North, with Brienne serving as her Captain of the Queen’s Guard, and Tyrion as her hand and consort. Arya, still goes off to find what’s west of formerly Westeros. Jon joins Ghost and the wildlings and is happy. 

As Arya lands on the uncharted lands, she finds a beautiful paradise. Drogon, with young dragons fly overhead. She continues to explore when she comes across a slaughtered village with the bodies arranged in symbolic spirals.

1238,"I’ve seen a lot of comments joking about how the Night’s Watch is useless now, even Jon made a joke of it, but is that really true? Here are a few reasons I think you still need at least some level of support a the wall-

White Walkers Return - if I’m a commoner in the north do I feel 100% confident the WW threat is gone forever? As viewers we understand thematically the conflict is over and everybody is safe, hurray. But if you live in Westeros do you trust some kid with visions that the zombies who almost wiped out human life are gone forever? Has anybody ranged far enough north of the wall to confirm none of the White Walkers are left where the NK was camping? They didn’t do anything for thousands of years before attacking, who’s to say there’s nobody left to rebuild and do the same in the future.

Wildings - Great we’re all friends now! Well the wildlings were raiding northern houses for generations and generations. What’s to stop them picking that back up again when  our buddies Tormund and Jon die off. Feels a little optimistic that the North would never have skirmishes with the Freefolk if the Nights Watch were to disband.

Wasn’t it mostly a Penal Colony in recent years anyway? Okay, so let’s say Bran sees a million years into the future and the White Walkers and Wildlings never attack the North again. That’s great! Wasn’t the Nights Watch mostly used to exile bastards and criminals anyway? Those certainly won’t be leaving Westeros anytime soon.

TLDR: Nights Watch would still need to exist after the events of the show because the threats of the White Walkers and Wildlings might not be gone for good, and it was mostly a penal colony anyway.",gameofthrones
1239," I’m beating the dead horse and I’m sorry about it. But I gotta rant. I had Jenny's Song stuck in my head as I got to work this morning. I pulled up the youtube video of Podrick singing it and I just got all the feels, good and bad. 

I’ve read countless entries on this sub and others. The general consensus is that the writing was terrible. Throughout the last season I gave the producers the benefit of the doubt. How can we judge an unfinished story? Almost a month on from the final episode and honestly, they really done this show dirty. And it breaks my heart. I’m fine with how it ended. Bran on the throne, Jon up north. Dany dead. It makes sense and I accept that ending to an extent.

What truly breaks my heart is partly what they’re leaving on the table and mostly how this last season has really just failed to live up to expectations, and I mean **reasonable** expectations. Like so many of you redditors out there, I spent YEARS with this show, I've rewatched the first six/seven seasons like 10 times. I got countless people into the show. I used Game of Thrones as a pick up line when I first met my now fiance. When the show was in the off season, I theorized. I spent hours with friends discussing what could happen, the politics, the characters, all of it. Too much time by the standards of a sane person. For all of this commitment, this fanfare, what did I get? What did ***we*** get?  Such disappointment that I did not reasonably expect, even when things were starting to go down hill. I really believed the showrunners in their promos before the season, at the end of the first couple episodes about how they were trying to give the show a great send off, comparable to the ending of Breaking Bad. I believed it, and I was heartbroken for it. Just listening to Jenny's Song now and I feel like I'm Jenny, that we are collectively Jenny. Dancing with the ghosts of the characters we loved, gone seasons ago, or this last season, spinning away all our sorrow and pain that is these last few seasons.

Every time I think of how this series ended, I think of this [meme](https://i.imgflip.com/2qf1c4.png) that circulated around a bit. They've taken an amazing show that the showrunners themselves are hugely responsible for, and massacred it. I can only look back on this show now and be met with frustration and sadness, thoughts of what could have been, how it was just pissed away to get the show done with. I am puzzled at the decision making. How did they not sanction a Jon/Grey Worm fight, or more Arya fighting, which we seriously only got like 5 minutes of her actually fighting bad guys THE ENTIRE SERIES.  I rooted for Jon. He was the fucking man in earlier seasons. The way he accepted certain death in the battle of the bastards was a straight power move. But they reduced him this season to nothing more than Dany’s bitch for 5.3 episodes. And that’s infuriating. There were so many seasons that logically should have been included that just weren’t and it’s head scratching. The show runners kept repeating in interviews they had enough material for a 70 hour movie, but honestly that's a blatant lie. They had enough material for ***at least*** 20 more hours.

It’s just a shame that this wonderful series was so mishandled in the end. I have a feeling the showrunners got distracted by Star Wars and put their own interests (and that franchise timeline) ahead of the GOT material and its fans. The show will still go down as a modern masterpiece. And there are parts of the final two seasons that are truly wonderful. I personally loved the episode of the burning of Kings landing. But in the end, the legacy will be one of missed opportunities. Of what could have been. Of what should have been. Of how not to finish a series. And in the end, for the years to come, we will be left with the characters we loved and lost, letting the greatness of the first few seasons spin us with the thoughts of the sorrow and pain left from the last two seasons, imaging what could have been.

1243,"The Valyrian Freehold showed interest in expanding its borders which worried the Children who feared that Westeros was next; the Children who’s population was decimated by the First Men and the Andals forged a plan to destroy their enemies and return power back to the rightful inhabitants of Westeros after thousands of years of conflict.

The Childrens’ attempt at harnessing Ice magic failed. They lost control and brought the Long Night. Learning from their mistakes the 3ER was created. The 3ER is an agent of the Children to infiltrate and divide the realms of men and to ultimately rule over Westeros (if you can’t beat them, be them, right?). He has been the master puppeteer shifting the course of history with his greenseer abilities. The 3ER is responsible for the cataclysmic events that have unfolded in Westeros.

Using his greenseer abilities the 3ER was able to locate the house that was most spiritually weak in The Valyrian Freehold - the Targaryen’s. They aren’t this mighty Valyrian superpower we are lead to believe - they are extremely susceptible to the powers of the 3ER who is able to manipulate them through dreams and visions as we have seen throughout Targaryen history. The 3ER warned Daenys ‘the dreamer’ Targaryen about the Doom a decade prior which led to the migration of Targaryen’s over to Dragonstone. They were the only house to survive the Doom of Valyria which was orchestrated by the Children.

The Children have used magic to decimate entire land masses in the wars against the First Men. To prevent the migration of the First Men the Children of the Forest destroyed the lands bridging Westeros and and Essos called the Arm of Dorne. They did the same in the Neck which is why there are so many rivers obstructing the landmass. They used this same magic to initiate the the Doom.

Following the doom the 3ER used fire magic to initiate a line of communication with followers to spread influence and consolidate power in Essos which lead to the founding of the religion of R’hllor. It is the only religion in ASOIF lore where the God actively displays their powers and this is because the 3ER is actively influencing and manipulating followers for personal gain - the 3ER is the physical embodiment of the Lord of Light. The magic used in the R’hllor religion is very similar to the dark magic used by the Children involving sacrifice and foresight which was used against the First Men.

The Targaryen’s would be used to consolidate power over Westeros and keep men in conflict for the next few centuries. The madness that we see in the Targaryen lineage is a result of this manipulation which was non existent back when they resided in Valyria. It only begun occurring when they reached Westeros. It is not a result of incest as they brought these traditions with them from Valyria. The 3ER is the ‘god’ that decides where the coin lands. They would be used as pawns to defeat the White walkers and dwindle the population of men in Westeros with the endgame of putting the the 3ER on the throne as an agent of The Children.

The 3ER intentionally allowed Bran to be marked by the Nights King to nullify the magic of the wall and allow for the NK to meet his demise at Winterfell. It’s no coincidence the Night King began moving south as soon as Bran/3ER did. Bran gave Arya the catspaw dagger to kill the NK.
Bran lied about the Night Kings motives. It was purely a quest for vengeance and anyone who stood between the Nights King’s desire for revenge would be destroyed. After defeating Bran the white walkers would retreat back North. The Night King would have actually saved humanity from the 3ER and would have prevented the destruction of Kings Landing (thenightkingdidnothingwrong). The symbols we see throughout the show were actually the WW attempting to communicate and warn humanity of the dark magic used by the Children. These symbols can be found and were carved by Children in the caves of Dragonstone to represent their power. 

The 3ER was the one who brought back Beric (to save Arya) and Jon (to kill Dany) as fire wights (GRRM Martin used this term to describe Jon and Beric). Again, supported by Brans ominous farewell to Jon at the end of the series “You were exactly where you were supposed to be.”- as if he were playing a game of chess. 

The 3ER was responsible for Dany’s descent into madness. He was the one who insisted on revealing Jon’s parentage right before the long night. He influenced her dreams and sowed dissent in her council to evoke paranoia. It was the 3ER who spoke to Vary’s in the flames which inspired his betrayal. The 3ER created the Mad Queen - to burn them all as his final play to become the king of Westeros. The 3ER will be king for the rest of eternity switching hosts to consolidate his power till the end of days.",gameofthrones
1244,"Jon ducks behind a rock to avoid the blue flames of Viserion. At first he looks terrified, but as he realizes that he can’t make it to Bran in time, his face shows the same rage as when he fought Ramsay. He draws longclaw, lets out a battle cry and charges at Viserion. It cuts to Arya jumping out at the Night King, and the Night King grabbing her by the throat.

Cuts back to Jon. Just as Viserion opens his mouth to fry Jon, he stabs longclaw into Viserions injured jaw (Unprotected by his scales due to the injury inflicted by Raegal) Viserion bursts into shards of ice. Cut back to Arya. The Night King has an expression of shock and terror on his face as he feels Viserion being destroyed. This distraction allows Arya to do her knife-switch technique and stab the Night King. The Night King bursts into shards of ice, as do all his generals. All the zombies crumple, the battle is won.

Cuts to a shot of longclaws hilt, the wolf head pommel has its eyes open. A hand closes around the sword and picks it up off the ground. Jon holds Longclaw up to his face, the blade burning with a bright blue flame. End of episode.

1245,"I had a shower thought when Ramins Light of the Seven came on which lead me to think about the Winds of Winter episode. The episode is one of my favourites and at the time it felt like a series finale to me. 

I'm unsure why but this episode was a better series finale than the Iron Throne. The music was outstanding, winter had arrived, the pay off of 6 seasons worth of stories, Dany finally heading to Westeros. Obviously theres alot of story left to tell but the tone of the episode felt very ""final"".

1247,"Wow!  What a jaw-dropping ride. There is so very much to be impressed by, and binge watching it at a rate of about 6 episodes a day was a whirlwind. 

First of all, I’m a movie person. The cinematic ambition always enthralls me, and this show is pure cinema.  The scale, cinematography, locations, sets, costumes, visual effects, sound, music, and of course the acting were all on a very high level I honestly didn’t expect and don’t believe I’ve ever seen from a tv series. I was blown away, and increasingly so as the series progressed through its seasons.  The combined effect of all of it was to produce a completely immersive experience that kept me entranced until the final fade-out of the ending episode. 

I laughed, I cried, I ached, I felt joy, I was spellbound, I was repulsed, and, in the end, I was happy and I was angry. 

One of the earliest lessons of the series, after just the first season, is that justice cannot be expected.  Indeed, if there is any deeper message to the stories, it seems to me that it is that justice is not what we think it is, and what may seem just or unjust in the present can be the opposite in the long term. Impulse must be tempered by insight. Fairness must be forged by failure. Judgment must be delivered gently.  If everyone were beheaded the moment they committed their worst act, out nations would be buried in heads. 

I have a lot of questions.  There’s a lot that was hard to piece together in my viewing.  I’m thinking about reading the books, now. So removed was I from this entire phenomenon that I didn’t even know the series was based on books. I am sure many of my questions will be answered by reading them. And then I will probably want to watch the series again.

1251,"Just a random high thought I had while reading TWOIAF. Is there any mention of a society that inhales the smoke given off by burning a certain type of grass? One whose effects maesters would describe as giving it's users a sense of calm and euphoria, followed by a drastic increase in appetite, loss of inhibition, and slight hightening of the senses?

I know there are several allusions in the lore to some types of drug use. But it wouldn't surprise me if they grew weed on Lys to help the business of the pleasure houses. Maybe the Children of the Forest used it in certain rituals. Who knows? All I know is that this has been incredibly fun to think about.",gameofthrones

I wanted to binge watch it after the seasons had ended, simply because I hate waiting for the next episode to come out.

I am now planning on commencing my binge. But I am wondering if I can just skip the first four seasons.

I have re-read all the books (heard actually - audio books), and having finished the last one, is there a convenient point where I can jump into the TV series?",gameofthrones

Was it because he had dragonglass with him? Was it because they wanted Sam to convey a message? But the nights watchmen already know about them? They kill wildlings and arrange their body parts in a weird fashion. A wight literally attacked the lord commander in his chamber. Doesn't really make sense,does it?

1258,"I'm about 80% through the first book of ASOIAF, and I've seen it referenced a couple times that Jon Arryn was going to send his son to Stannis Baratheon to be fostered, instead of Tywinn Lannister.

This information seems to perplex Catelyn and Ned when they first hear it. Why is it that this info is so surprising to them?  


I have seen the entire television series, so based off of what I know from that, my immediate thought is that this is meant to be the beginning of suspicion toward Lysa Arryn's involvement in her husband's death. but why would it matter to Lysa Arynn which place her son is sent? Or is it just that her son being taken away from her, that she decides to kill her husband?  
And was Jon Arryn wanting to send his son to Dragonstone instead of Casterly Rock because of his growing suspicion of the legitimacy of Cersei's children/mistrust of the Lannisters?",gameofthrones
1259,"Eventually go to the wall and end up with Jon. Just like Robert Lyanna and Rhaegar. I think the books will go past Brand rule and we will see how all of this plays out. I believe D&amp;D just thought it would be better to shop and Danny’s death. This is why I think GRRM wanted way more seasons also. There are just way too similarities between each other their journeys. Both fell in love with commoners, were outcasts, warriors, both stabbed. In season 8 the way Jon touches her and she looks at him is just really weird to me especially in the last episode when he sees her in KL. They were channeling the same hair style too. George always said he didn’t like how lord of the rings ending with just the king getting married. He said he wanted to see his rule and what happens after. I think the last book will more or less have what happens with all of the characters ultimately. Plus if Arya and Jon has a baby it could end up sitting on the throne for the end. Maybe Bran knows all of the is and that’s why he is sending Jon to the wall.",gameofthrones

Jon’s going north of the wall to become the new Craster. 

He’s gonna meet a 3rd woman. He’s gonna fuck his wife. Then fuck his daughters just to continue the tradition. 

There’s going to still be a nights watch. So maybe there needs to be a craster. 

Some of you might say that he doesn’t need to fuck his daughter-wives because the white walkers are gone. And you’re right. He doesn’t. And I have no come back for that.

I was re-watching Hardhome the other day and stumbled across this beautiful exchange between Olly and Sam.

Sam: ""Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others, but you know are right in the long run. ""

Olly: ""You believe that?""

Sam: ""With all my heart... Try not to worry, Olly. I've been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.""

&amp;#x200B;

There's something absolutely wonderful about this exchange!

As soon as Sam says that first line, Olly looks like something clicked in his head. He asks for confirmation and then it totally is solidified in his mind that he needs to stop Jon.

Sam's word choice of ""heart"" is a small detail, might even be a bit of a reach, but still a wonderful touch!

And of course... finally planting the ""he always comes back"" ending to bring it all together. So great!

1264,"Finally finished watching Season 8. Overall it felt a little rushed and I couldn’t wrap my head around the Jaime + Brienne thing. When he knighted her it felt like a nice moment and I got choked up. I thought that was going to be the extent of their friendship. But when everyone was drinking after I felt like he totally took advantage of her even after admitting she had never slept with anyone! Then she was literally BAWLING when he left to go be with Cersei! I feel like his character arc was turning “good” then all of a sudden he’s back with Cersei and dies. 

Then, even after he dies in Ceresei’s arms, Brienne still wants to make him look like a good guy when she writes in the book. It made me sad for Brienne and I feel like it just shows how good of a person she is. I loved Jaime but that whole thing just felt off. Thoughts?

She prayed to the gods and said that she would love him and treat him well if they healed him. He got better but she found she couldnt bring herself to love him like ahe promised. She wonders if Brans injuries are punishment for her breaking her promise.
